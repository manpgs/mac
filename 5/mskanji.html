<p class="Pp">Shift-JIS, also known as MS Kanji or SJIS, is an encoding system
    for Japanese characters, developed by Microsoft Corporation. It encodes the
    characters from the JIS X 0201 (ASCII/JIS-Roman) and JIS X 0208 (Japanese)
    character sets as sequences of either one or two bytes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Characters from the ASCII/JIS-Roman character set are encoded as
    single bytes between 0x00 and 0x7F (ASCII) or 0xA1 and 0xDF (Half-width
    katakana).</p>
<p class="Pp">Characters from the JIS X 0208 character set are encoded as two
    bytes. The first ranges from 0x81 - 0x9F, 0xE0 - 0xEA, 0xED - 0xEE (not JIS:
    NEC-selected IBM extended characters), 0xF0 - 0xF9 (not JIS: user defined),
    or 0xFA - 0xFC (not JIS: IBM extended characters). The second byte ranges
    from 0x40 - 0xFC, excluding 0x7F (delete).</p>
