<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A cryptex is a cryptographically-sealed archive which encapsulates
    a well- defined filesystem hierarchy. The host operating system recognizes
    the hierarchy of the cryptex and extends itself with the content of that
    hierarchy. The name &quot;cryptex&quot; is a portmanteau for
    &quot;CRYPTographically-sealed EXtension&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike other archive formats (e.g.
    <a class="Xr" href="../1/tar">tar(1)</a>,
    <a class="Xr" href="../1/cpio">cpio(1)</a>, etc.), the content of a cryptex
    is not intended to be merged to a filesystem root. Conventionally, archives
    are merged to the root filesystem so that the operating system can discover
    new or updated content at a set of pre-determined paths that are relative to
    the filesystem root. For example, the user's chosen shell may discover
    executables in <span class="Pa">/usr/bin</span>, and therefore new
    executables must be merged into that location in order for the shell to
    discover them.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, as Darwin has more aggressively defended its operating
    system bits from tampering (e.g. via the Signed System Volume), it has
    become necessary to begin recognizing other content roots that are separate
    from the system but otherwise writeable by the user. For example, the shell
    may also discover executables in <span class="Pa">/usr/local/bin</span>,
    which resides on the data volume rather than the signed and immutable system
    volume.</p>
<p class="Pp">But these extra roots essentially force a single package of
    software to &quot;break itself up&quot; in order to be installed. Shell
    tools must be copied to one location, dynamic libraries to another, daemons
    to still another, etc. Once this is done, all provenance for the software is
    more or less lost unless the operating system employs complex monitoring and
    tracking of filesystem events.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of extracting content and merging it to another
    filesystem, a cryptex is instead mounted at a randomly-chosen location when
    the system boots. Its content may then be examined by any subsystems which
    are interested in discovering content from cryptexes. In other words,
    subsystems must explicitly be taught about the possible existence of cryptex
    content, and the usefulness of cryptexes is directly proportional to the
    number of subsystems that agree to look for their contents.</p>
<p class="Pp">This scheme maintains the structure of a software package as a
    single entity that is always handled as such. Prior to mounting the
    filesystem, the operating system can verify that the archive file itself has
    not been tampered with by taking a measurement of it and comparing to a
    known-good measurement before agreeing to mount it.</p>

<p class="Pp">A cryptex houses a filesystem that very much
    <a class="permalink" href="#appears"><i class="Em" id="appears">appears</i></a>
    as though it is intended to be merged to the root of a Darwin operating
    system. This is intentional. The distribution root produced by building a
    Darwin project should be able to be used as a cryptex assuming all relevant
    subsystems have been taught about cryptex content. Thus, cryptexes can be
    thought of as

    <span class="Pa">Library</span> directory locations and precedence into
    <a class="permalink" href="#views"><i class="Em" id="views">views</i></a>.
    These conventions are documented in the &#x201C;File System Programming
    Guide&#x201D; available on Apple Developer Documentation Archive.</p>
<p class="Pp">Views are distinguished by root directories in the filesystem, and
    each the view in which a piece of content resides has implications about the
    intended scope of that content. Defined views are</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="CONTENT"><a class="permalink" href="#CONTENT">CONTENT</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Cryptexes impose the restriction that for a piece of content,
    there is only one directory within a view which may house that content, and
    two types of content may not share a directory. This is a generally
    agreed-upon convention in Darwin and other POSIX-comforming or Unix-like
    operating systems, but there are typically no technical barriers in place to
    enforce it.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="a">The <code class="Nm">cryptex</code> subsystem provides
    these barriers by requiring <a class="permalink" href="#a"><i class="Em">a
    priori</i></a> knowledge of a type of content before it can be published for
    discovery to the broader operating system. Because the
    <code class="Nm">cryptex</code> subsystem maintains complete control over
    where cryptexes are published and available in the filesystem, other
    subsystems cannot simply crawl the filesystem and reliably discover content
    they are interested in. These subsystems must ask the
    <code class="Nm">cryptex</code> subsystem for a
    <a class="permalink" href="#type"><i class="Em" id="type">type of
    content</i></a> of a <i class="Em">specific name</i> within a
    <i class="Em">specific view</i>. The path to a given piece of content is
    constructed from this
    <a class="permalink" href="#(view,"><i class="Em" id="(view,">(view, type,
    name)</i></a> tuple. Put another way, rather than inferring information
    about content type and scope from a filesystem path, cryptexes construct the
    filesystem path from information about content type and scope.</p>
