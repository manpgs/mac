  tools.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The syntax and semantics of management information in SNMP is
    given by the definitions of MIB objects, loaded from one or more MIB files
    (or &quot;MIB modules&quot;). These definitions are not strictly required
    for the SNMP protocol to operate correctly, but are typically needed by SNMP
    client applications to display information in a meaningful manner.</p>
<p class="Pp">The MIB file also serves as a design document when developing an
    SNMP agent (or sub-agent) that provides this information, and ensures that
    client and server share a common understanding about what management
    information represents.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OIDs"><a class="permalink" href="#OIDs">OIDs</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">MIB objects are specified using Object Identifiers (OIDs), which
    can take a number of forms. Note that all of the examples in this section
    refer to the same MIB object.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Numeric_OIDs"><a class="permalink" href="#Numeric_OIDs">Numeric
  OIDs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The fundamental format of an OID is a sequence of integer values
    (or &quot;subidentifiers&quot;), typically written using dots to separate
    the individual subidentifiers.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1</div>
This is the format that is used within the SNMP protocol itself, in the packets
  that are sent over the network.
<p class="Pp">This form of representing an OID does not require MIB files or MIB
    object definitions to be available. However it does rely on the client
    application and/or network administrator knowing what a given numeric OID
    refers to. As such, it is not a particularly helpful representation to
    anyone just starting out with SNMP.</p>
<p class="Pp">This format can be obtained by giving the command-line option -On
    to most Net-SNMP commands.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Full_OID_path"><a class="permalink" href="#Full_OID_path">Full
  OID path</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A similar (but somewhat more informative) format uses the same
    dotted list representation, but with the numeric subidentifiers replaced by
    names, taken from the relevant MIB file(s).</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
 .iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.system.sysDescr</div>
This uniquely identifies a particular MIB object (as with the numeric OID), but
  the list of names should hopefully give some indication as to what information
  this object represents. However it does rely on the relevant MIB files being
  available (as do all formats other than the purely numeric OID). Such OIDs
  also tend to be fairly long!
<p class="Pp">This format can be obtained by giving the command-line option -Of
    to most Net-SNMP commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">A variant of this (typically used when writing OIDs in descriptive
    text, rather than running programs), is to combine the name and numeric
    subidentifier:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
 .iso(1).org(3).dod(6).internet(1).mgmt(2).mib-2(1).system(1).sysDescr(1)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Module-qualified_OIDs"><a class="permalink" href="#Module-qualified_OIDs">Module-qualified
  OIDs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">An alternative way to (more-or-less) uniquely specify an OID, is
    to give the name of the MIB object, together with the MIB module where it is
    defined.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr</div>
MIB object names are unique within a given module, so as long as there are not
  two MIB modules with the same name (which is unusual, though not unheard of),
  this format specifies the desired object in a reasonably compact form. It also
  makes it relatively easy to find the definition of the MIB object.
<p class="Pp">This is the default format for displaying OIDs in Net-SNMP
    applications. It can also be specified explicitly by giving the command-line
    option -OS to most Net-SNMP commands.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Object_name"><a class="permalink" href="#Object_name">Object
  name</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Possibly the most common form for specifying MIB objects is using
    the name of the object alone - without the full path or the name of the
    module that defines it.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">sysDescr</div>
This is by far the shortest and most convenient way to refer to a MIB object.
  However the danger is that if two MIB modules each define a MIB object with
  the same name (which is perfectly legal in some circumstances), then it's not
  necessarily clear which MIB object is actually meant. For day-to-day use,
  particularly when using standard MIB objects, this is <i>probaby</i> safe. But
  it's important to be aware of the potential ambiguities.
<p class="Pp">This format can be obtained by giving the command-line option -Os
    to most Net-SNMP commands.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="UCD-format"><a class="permalink" href="#UCD-format">UCD-format</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Previous versions of the code (UCD v4.x and earlier) used a simple
    approach to shortening the way OIDs were specified. If the full path of the
    OID began with .iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2<i></i> <i>then this prefix
    was removed from the OID before displaying it.</i> <i>All other OIDs were
    displayed in full.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, if an OID was passed to the UCD library that did not
    begin with a dot (and wasn't in the module::name format), then the same
    prefix was prepended. The example OID from the formats listed above would
    therefore be given or displayed as</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">system.sysDescr</div>
The inconsistent handling of OIDs, depending on their location within the OID
  tree, proved to be more trouble than it was worth, and this format is no
  longer recommended.
<p class="Pp">The previous behaviour can be obtained by giving the command-line
    option -Ou (for displaying output), or -Iu (for interpreting input OIDs
    without a leading dot) to most Net-SNMP commands.</p>
