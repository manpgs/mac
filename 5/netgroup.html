<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">netgroup</code> file specifies ``netgroups'',
    which are sets of
    <a class="permalink" href="#(host,"><b class="Sy" id="(host,">(host, user,
    domain)</b></a> tuples that are to be given similar network access.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each line in the file consists of a netgroup name followed by a
    list of the members of the netgroup. Each member can be either the name of
    another netgroup or a specification of a tuple as follows:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>(host, user, domain)</pre>
</div>
where the
  <a class="permalink" href="#host"><b class="Sy" id="host">host</b></a>,
  <a class="permalink" href="#user"><b class="Sy" id="user">user</b></a>, and
  <a class="permalink" href="#domain"><b class="Sy" id="domain">domain</b></a>
  are character string names for the corresponding component. Any of the comma
  separated fields may be empty to specify a ``wildcard'' value or may consist
  of the string ``-'' to specify ``no valid value''. The members of the list may
  be separated by whitespace and/or commas; the ``\'' character may be used at
  the end of a line to specify line continuation. The functions specified in
  <a class="Xr" href="../3/getnetgrent">getnetgrent(3)</a> should normally be
  used to access the <code class="Nm">netgroup</code> database.
<p class="Pp">Lines that begin with a # are treated as comments.</p>

<p class="Pp">The interpretation of access restrictions based on the member
    tuples of a netgroup is left up to the various network applications. Also,
    it is not obvious how the domain specification applies to the BSD
    environment.</p>
