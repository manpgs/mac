<p class="Pp">This document describes the keys-value pairs which configure an
    XPC Service. An XPC Service is a process which implements the server-side of
    an <code class="Nm">XPC</code> connection. The service program is contained
    inside a Mac OS X bundle. The bundle contains an Info.plist. The XPC Service
    configuration settings are specified by keys and values defined in a
    dictionary included within the Info.plist.</p>

<p class="Pp">An application has a namespace which maps a service name to a
    running instance of the service program. The namespace is created
    dynamically and is unique to each application. The namespace is populated
    with the set of services embedded in the application bundle and embedded in
    the frameworks used by the application.</p>
<p class="Pp">System frameworks may have embedded XPC Services. Typically, a
    developer would not connect to this service directly. Instead, the developer
    would call an API function in the framework and that would contact the
    service. However, the name of XPC Service must be in the application's
    namespace so that the framework code can &quot;see&quot; and connect to the
    service.</p>
<p class="Pp">XPC Services are &quot;launched-on-demand&quot;. They are only
    started when an application creates a connection to the service and sends a
    message to it. The service process can be terminated when it is inactive and
    has been idle for a a period of time. The service process can be started
    again upon receipt of a new message or connection request. XPC Services
    should be state-less so that they can come and go as needed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The results of a connection request to an XPC Service from two
    different applications depends upon the type of the service. The service
    type controls the policy used to create a new instance of the service. For
    example, a new connection request from two different applications to an
    Application-type service in a framework will result in a new instance of the
    service being created for each application.</p>
<p class="Pp">Services embedded in an application bundle will only be visible to
    the containing application and will be, by default, Application-type
    services. A subsequent connection request from an application to a service
    will result in a new connection to an existing service.</p>

        Each application will have a unique instance of this service.</li>
      <li>System

        There is one instance of the service process for the whole system.
