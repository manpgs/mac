<p class="Pp">The <b>meta</b> backend to <b>slapd</b>(8) performs basic LDAP
    proxying with respect to a set of remote LDAP servers, called
    &quot;targets&quot;. The information contained in these servers can be
    presented as belonging to a single Directory Information Tree (DIT).</p>
<p class="Pp">A basic knowledge of the functionality of the <b>slapd-ldap</b>(5)
    backend is recommended. This backend has been designed as an enhancement of
    the ldap backend. The two backends share many features (actually they also
    share portions of code). While the <b>ldap</b> backend is intended to proxy
    operations directed to a single server, the <b>meta</b> backend is mainly
    intended for proxying of multiple servers and possibly naming context
    masquerading. These features, although useful in many scenarios, may result
    in excessive overhead for some applications, so its use should be carefully
    considered. In the examples section, some typical scenarios will be
    discussed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The proxy instance of <b>slapd</b>(8) must contain schema
    information for the attributes and objectClasses used in filters, request DN
    and request-related data in general. It should also contain schema
    information for the data returned by the proxied server. It is the
    responsibility of the proxy administrator to keep the schema of the proxy
    lined up with that of the proxied server.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Note: When looping back to the same instance of <b>slapd</b>(8),
    each connection requires a new thread; as a consequence, <b>slapd</b>(8)
    must be compiled with thread support, and the <b>threads</b> parameter may
    need some tuning; in those cases, unless the multiple target feature is
    required, one may consider using <b>slapd-relay</b>(5) instead, which
    performs the relayed operation internally and thus reuses the same
    connection.</p>

<p class="Pp">These <b>slapd.conf</b> options apply to the META backend
    database. That is, they must follow a &quot;database meta&quot; line and
    come before any subsequent &quot;backend&quot; or &quot;database&quot;
    lines. Other database options are described in the <b>slapd.conf</b>(5)
    manual page.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: In early versions of back-ldap and back-meta it was
    recommended to always set</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>lastmod  off</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">for <b>ldap</b> and <b>meta</b> databases. This was required
    because operational attributes related to entry creation and modification
    should not be proxied, as they could be mistakenly written to the target
    server(s), generating an error. The current implementation automatically
    sets lastmod to <b>off</b>, so its use is redundant and should be
  omitted.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SPECIAL_CONFIGURATION_DIRECTIVES"><a class="permalink" href="#SPECIAL_CONFIGURATION_DIRECTIVES">SPECIAL
  CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Target configuration starts with the &quot;uri&quot; directive.
    All the configuration directives that are not specific to targets should be
    defined first for clarity, including those that are common to all backends.
    They are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="conn"><a class="permalink" href="#conn"><b>conn-ttl
    &lt;time&gt;</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This directive causes a cached connection to be dropped an recreated after
      a given ttl, regardless of being idle or not.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="default"><a class="permalink" href="#default"><b>default-target
    none</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This directive forces the backend to reject all those operations that must
      resolve to a single target in case none or multiple targets are selected.
      They include: add, delete, modify, modrdn; compare is not included, as
      well as bind since, as they don't alter entries, in case of multiple
      matches an attempt is made to perform the operation on any candidate
      target, with the constraint that at most one must succeed. This directive
      can also be used when processing targets to mark a specific target as
      default.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="dncache"><a class="permalink" href="#dncache"><b>dncache-ttl
    {DISABLED|forever|&lt;ttl&gt;}</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This directive sets the time-to-live of the DN cache. This caches the
      target that holds a given DN to speed up target selection in case multiple
      targets would result from an uncached search; forever means cache never
      expires; disabled means no DN caching; otherwise a valid ( &gt; 0 ) ttl is
      required, in the format illustrated for the <b>idle-timeout</b> directive.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="onerr"><a class="permalink" href="#onerr"><b>onerr
    {CONTINUE|report|stop}</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This directive allows to select the behavior in case an error is returned
      by one target during a search. The default, <b>continue</b>, consists in
      continuing the operation, trying to return as much data as possible. If
      the value is set to <b>stop</b>, the search is terminated as soon as an
      error is returned by one target, and the error is immediately propagated
      to the client. If the value is set to <b>report</b>, the search is
      continuated to the end but, in case at least one target returned an error
      code, the first non-success error code is returned.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="norefs"><a class="permalink" href="#norefs"><b>norefs
    &lt;NO|yes&gt;</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If <b>yes</b>, do not return search reference responses. By default, they
      are returned unless request is LDAPv2. If set before any target
      specification, it affects all targets, unless overridden by any per-target
      directive.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="noundeffilter"><a class="permalink" href="#noundeffilter"><b>noundeffilter
    &lt;NO|yes&gt;</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If <b>yes</b>, return success instead of searching if a filter is
      undefined or contains undefined portions. By default, the search is
      propagated after replacing undefined portions with
      <b>(!(objectClass=*))</b>, which corresponds to the empty result set. If
      set before any target specification, it affects all targets, unless
      overridden by any per-target directive.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="protocol"><a class="permalink" href="#protocol"><b>protocol-version
    {0,2,3}</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This directive indicates what protocol version must be used to contact the
      remote server. If set to 0 (the default), the proxy uses the same protocol
      version used by the client, otherwise the requested protocol is used. The
      proxy returns <i>unwillingToPerform</i> if an operation that is
      incompatible with the requested protocol is attempted. If set before any
      target specification, it affects all targets, unless overridden by any
      per-target directive.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="pseudoroot"><a class="permalink" href="#pseudoroot"><b>pseudoroot-bind-defer
    {YES|no}</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This directive, when set to <b>yes</b>, causes the authentication to the
      remote servers with the pseudo-root identity (the identity defined in each
      <b>idassert-bind</b> directive) to be deferred until actually needed by
      subsequent operations. Otherwise, all binds as the rootdn are propagated
      to the targets.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="quarantine"><a class="permalink" href="#quarantine"><b>quarantine
    &lt;interval&gt;,&lt;num&gt;[;&lt;interval&gt;,&lt;num&gt;[...]]</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Turns on quarantine of URIs that returned <i>LDAP_UNAVAILABLE</i>, so that
      an attempt to reconnect only occurs at given intervals instead of any time
      a client requests an operation. The pattern is: retry only after at least
      <i>interval</i> seconds elapsed since last attempt, for exactly <i>num</i>
      times; then use the next pattern. If <i>num</i> for the last pattern is
      &quot;<b>+</b>&quot;, it retries forever; otherwise, no more retries
      occur. This directive must appear before any target specification; it
      affects all targets with the same pattern.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="rebind"><a class="permalink" href="#rebind"><b>rebind-as-user
    {NO|yes}</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If this option is given, the client's bind credentials are remembered for
      rebinds, when trying to re-establish a broken connection, or when chasing
      a referral, if <b>chase-referrals</b> is set to <i>yes</i>.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="session"><a class="permalink" href="#session"><b>session-tracking-request
    {NO|yes}</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Adds session tracking control for all requests. The client's IP and
      hostname, and the identity associated to each request, if known, are sent
      to the remote server for informational purposes. This directive is
      incompatible with setting <i>protocol-version</i> to 2. If set before any
      target specification, it affects all targets, unless overridden by any
      per-target directive.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="single"><a class="permalink" href="#single"><b>single-conn
    {NO|yes}</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Discards current cached connection when the client rebinds.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="use"><a class="permalink" href="#use"><b>use-temporary-conn
    {NO|yes}</b></a></dt>
  <dd>when set to <b>yes</b>, create a temporary connection whenever competing

  <dd>The &lt;protocol&gt; part can be anything <b>ldap_initialize</b>(3)
      accepts ({ldap|ldaps|ldapi} and variants); the &lt;host&gt; may be
      omitted, defaulting to whatever is set in <b>ldap.conf</b>(5). The
      &lt;naming context&gt; part is <i>mandatory</i> for the first URI, but it
      <i>must be omitted</i> for subsequent ones, if any. The naming context
      part must be within the naming context defined for the backend, e.g.:</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>suffix &quot;<b>dc=foo,dc=com</b>&quot;
uri    &quot;ldap://x.foo.com/dc=x,<b>dc=foo,dc=com</b>&quot;</pre>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">The &lt;naming context&gt; part doesn't need to be unique
  across the targets; it may also match one of the values of the
  &quot;suffix&quot; directive. Multiple URIs may be defined in a single URI
  statement. The additional URIs must be separate arguments and must not have
  any &lt;naming context&gt; part. This causes the underlying library to contact
  the first server of the list that responds. For example, if <i>l1.foo.com</i>
  and <i>l2.foo.com</i> are shadows of the same server, the directive
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>suffix &quot;<b>dc=foo,dc=com</b>&quot;
uri    &quot;ldap://l1.foo.com/<b>dc=foo,dc=com</b>&quot; &quot;ldap://l2.foo.com/&quot;</pre>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">causes <i>l2.foo.com</i> to be contacted whenever

<div class="Bd-indent">Allows to define the parameters of the authentication
  method that is internally used by the proxy to authorize connections that are
  authenticated by other databases. The identity defined by this directive,
  according to the properties associated to the authentication method, is
  supposed to have auth access on the target server to attributes used on the
  proxy for authentication and authorization, and to be allowed to authorize the
  users. This requires to have <b>proxyAuthz</b> privileges on a wide set of
  DNs, e.g. <b>authzTo=dn.subtree:&quot;&quot;</b>, and the remote server to
  have <b>authz-policy</b> set to <b>to</b> or <b>both</b>. See
  <b>slapd.conf</b>(5) for details on these statements and for remarks and
  drawbacks about their usage. The supported bindmethods are
<p class="Pp"><b>none|simple|sasl</b></p>
<p class="Pp">where <b>none</b> is the default, i.e. no <i>identity
    assertion</i> is performed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The authz parameter is used to instruct the SASL bind to exploit
    <b>native</b> SASL authorization, if available; since connections are
    cached, this should only be used when authorizing with a fixed identity
    (e.g. by means of the <b>authzDN</b> or <b>authzID</b> parameters).
    Otherwise, the default <b>proxyauthz</b> is used, i.e. the proxyAuthz
    control (Proxied Authorization, RFC 4370) is added to all operations.</p>
<p class="Pp">The supported modes are:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>&lt;mode&gt; := {legacy|anonymous|none|self}</b></p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b> is not present, and <b>authzId</b> is
    given, the proxy always authorizes that identity. <b>&lt;authorization
    ID&gt;</b> can be</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>u:&lt;user&gt;</b></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>[dn:]&lt;DN&gt;</b></p>
<p class="Pp">The former is supposed to be expanded by the remote server
    according to the authz rules; see <b>slapd.conf</b>(5) for details. In the
    latter case, whether or not the <b>dn:</b> prefix is present, the string
    must pass DN validation and normalization.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default mode is <b>legacy</b>, which implies that the proxy
    will either perform a simple bind as the <i>authcDN</i> or a SASL bind as
    the <i>authcID</i> and assert the client's identity when it is not
    anonymous. Direct binds are always proxied. The other modes imply that the
    proxy will always either perform a simple bind as the <i>authcDN</i> or a
    SASL bind as the <i>authcID</i>, unless restricted by
    <b>idassert-authzFrom</b> rules (see below), in which case the operation
    will fail; eventually, it will assert some other identity according to
    <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>. Other identity assertion modes are <b>anonymous</b> and
    <b>self</b>, which respectively mean that the <i>empty</i> or the
    <i>client</i>'s identity will be asserted; <b>none</b>, which means that no
    proxyAuthz control will be used, so the <i>authcDN</i> or the <i>authcID</i>
    identity will be asserted. For all modes that require the use of the
    <i>proxyAuthz</i> control, on the remote server the proxy identity must have
    appropriate <i>authzTo</i> permissions, or the asserted identities must have
    appropriate <i>authzFrom</i> permissions. Note, however, that the ID
    assertion feature is mostly useful when the asserted identities do not exist
    on the remote server.</p>
<p class="Pp">Flags can be</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>override,[non-]prescriptive,proxy-authz-[non-]critical</b></p>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>override</b> flag is used, identity assertion takes
    place even when the database is authorizing for the identity of the client,
    i.e. after binding with the provided identity, and thus authenticating it,
    the proxy performs the identity assertion using the configured identity and
    authentication method.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>prescriptive</b> flag is used (the default),
    operations fail with <i>inappropriateAuthentication</i> for those identities
    whose assertion is not allowed by the <b>idassert-authzFrom</b> patterns. If
    the <b>non-prescriptive</b> flag is used, operations are performed
    anonymously for those identities whose assertion is not allowed by the
    <b>idassert-authzFrom</b> patterns.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>proxy-authz-non-critical</b> flag is used (the
    default), the proxyAuthz control is not marked as critical, in violation of
    RFC 4370. Use of <b>proxy-authz-critical</b> is recommended.</p>
<p class="Pp">The TLS settings default to the same as the main slapd TLS
    settings, except for <b>tls_reqcert</b> which defaults to
    &quot;demand&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The identity associated to this directive is also used for
    privileged operations whenever <b>idassert-bind</b> is defined and
    <b>acl-bind</b> is not. See <b>acl-bind</b> for details.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SCENARIOS"><a class="permalink" href="#SCENARIOS">SCENARIOS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A powerful (and in some sense dangerous) rewrite engine has been
    added to both the LDAP and Meta backends. While the former can gain limited
    beneficial effects from rewriting stuff, the latter can become an amazingly
    powerful tool.</p>
<p class="Pp">Consider a couple of scenarios first.</p>
<p class="Pp">1) Two directory servers share two levels of naming context; say
    &quot;dc=a,dc=foo,dc=com&quot; and &quot;dc=b,dc=foo,dc=com&quot;. Then, an
    unambiguous Meta database can be configured as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>database meta
suffix   &quot;<b>dc=foo,dc=com</b>&quot;
uri      &quot;ldap://a.foo.com/dc=a,<b>dc=foo,dc=com</b>&quot;
uri      &quot;ldap://b.foo.com/dc=b,<b>dc=foo,dc=com</b>&quot;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Operations directed to a specific target can be easily resolved
    because there are no ambiguities. The only operation that may resolve to
    multiple targets is a search with base &quot;dc=foo,dc=com&quot; and scope
    at least &quot;one&quot;, which results in spawning two searches to the
    targets.</p>
<p class="Pp">2a) Two directory servers don't share any portion of naming
    context, but they'd present as a single DIT [Caveat: uniqueness of
    (massaged) entries among the two servers is assumed; integrity checks risk
    to incur in excessive overhead and have not been implemented]. Say we have
    &quot;dc=bar,dc=org&quot; and &quot;o=Foo,c=US&quot;, and we'd like them to
    appear as branches of &quot;dc=foo,dc=com&quot;, say
    &quot;dc=a,dc=foo,dc=com&quot; and &quot;dc=b,dc=foo,dc=com&quot;. Then we
    need to configure our Meta backend as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>database      meta
suffix        &quot;dc=foo,dc=com&quot;
uri           &quot;ldap://a.bar.com/<b>dc=a,dc=foo,dc=com</b>&quot;
suffixmassage &quot;<b>dc=a,dc=foo,dc=com</b>&quot; &quot;dc=bar,dc=org&quot;
uri           &quot;ldap://b.foo.com/<b>dc=b,dc=foo,dc=com</b>&quot;
suffixmassage &quot;<b>dc=b,dc=foo,dc=com</b>&quot; &quot;o=Foo,c=US&quot;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Again, operations can be resolved without ambiguity, although some
    rewriting is required. Notice that the virtual naming context of each target
    is a branch of the database's naming context; it is rewritten back and forth
    when operations are performed towards the target servers. What &quot;back
    and forth&quot; means will be clarified later.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a search with base &quot;dc=foo,dc=com&quot; is attempted, if
    the scope is &quot;base&quot; it fails with &quot;no such object&quot;; in
    fact, the common root of the two targets (prior to massaging) does not
    exist. If the scope is &quot;one&quot;, both targets are contacted with the
    base replaced by each target's base; the scope is derated to
    &quot;base&quot;. In general, a scope &quot;one&quot; search is honored, and
    the scope is derated, only when the incoming base is at most one level lower
    of a target's naming context (prior to massaging).</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, if the scope is &quot;sub&quot; the incoming base is
    replaced by each target's unmassaged naming context, and the scope is not
    altered.</p>
<p class="Pp">2b) Consider the above reported scenario with the two servers
    sharing the same naming context:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>database      meta
suffix        &quot;<b>dc=foo,dc=com</b>&quot;
uri           &quot;ldap://a.bar.com/<b>dc=foo,dc=com</b>&quot;
suffixmassage &quot;<b>dc=foo,dc=com</b>&quot; &quot;dc=bar,dc=org&quot;
uri           &quot;ldap://b.foo.com/<b>dc=foo,dc=com</b>&quot;
suffixmassage &quot;<b>dc=foo,dc=com</b>&quot; &quot;o=Foo,c=US&quot;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">All the previous considerations hold, except that now there is no
    way to unambiguously resolve a DN. In this case, all the operations that
    require an unambiguous target selection will fail unless the DN is already
    cached or a default target has been set. Practical configurations may result
    as a combination of all the above scenarios.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ACLs"><a class="permalink" href="#ACLs">ACLs</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Note on ACLs: at present you may add whatever ACL rule you desire
    to to the Meta (and LDAP) backends. However, the meaning of an ACL on a
    proxy may require some considerations. Two philosophies may be
  considered:</p>
<p class="Pp">a) the remote server dictates the permissions; the proxy simply
    passes back what it gets from the remote server.</p>
<p class="Pp">b) the remote server unveils &quot;everything&quot;; the proxy is
    responsible for protecting data from unauthorized access.</p>
<p class="Pp">Of course the latter sounds unreasonable, but it is not. It is
    possible to imagine scenarios in which a remote host discloses data that can
    be considered &quot;public&quot; inside an intranet, and a proxy that
    connects it to the internet may impose additional constraints. To this
    purpose, the proxy should be able to comply with all the ACL matching
    criteria that the server supports. This has been achieved with regard to all
    the criteria supported by slapd except a special subtle case (please file an
    ITS if you can find other exceptions: &lt;http://www.openldap.org/its/&gt;).
    The rule</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>access to dn=&quot;&lt;dn&gt;&quot; attrs=&lt;attr&gt;
       by dnattr=&lt;dnattr&gt; read
       by * none</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">cannot be matched iff the attribute that is being requested,
    &lt;attr&gt;, is NOT &lt;dnattr&gt;, and the attribute that determines
    membership, &lt;dnattr&gt;, has not been requested (e.g. in a search)</p>
<p class="Pp">In fact this ACL is resolved by slapd using the portion of entry
    it retrieved from the remote server without requiring any further
    intervention of the backend, so, if the &lt;dnattr&gt; attribute has not
    been fetched, the match cannot be assessed because the attribute is not
    present, not because no value matches the requirement!</p>
<p class="Pp">Note on ACLs and attribute mapping: ACLs are applied to the mapped
    attributes; for instance, if the attribute locally known as &quot;foo&quot;
    is mapped to &quot;bar&quot; on a remote server, then local ACLs apply to
    attribute &quot;foo&quot; and are totally unaware of its remote name. The
    remote server will check permissions for &quot;bar&quot;, and the local
    server will possibly enforce additional restrictions to &quot;foo&quot;.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="REWRITING"><a class="permalink" href="#REWRITING">REWRITING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A string is rewritten according to a set of rules, called a
    `rewrite context'. The rules are based on POSIX (''extended'') regular
    expressions (regex) with substring matching; basic variable substitution and
    map resolution of substrings is allowed by specific mechanisms detailed in
    the following. The behavior of pattern matching/substitution can be altered
    by a set of flags.</p>
<p class="Pp">The underlying concept is to build a lightweight rewrite module
    for the slapd server (initially dedicated to the LDAP backend).</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Passes"><a class="permalink" href="#Passes">Passes</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">An incoming string is matched against a set of rules. Rules are
    made of a regex match pattern, a substitution pattern and a set of actions,
    described by a set of flags. In case of match a string rewriting is
    performed according to the substitution pattern that allows to refer to
    substrings matched in the incoming string. The actions, if any, are finally
    performed. The substitution pattern allows map resolution of substrings. A
    map is a generic object that maps a substitution pattern to a value. The
    flags are divided in &quot;Pattern matching Flags&quot; and &quot;Action
    Flags&quot;; the former alter the regex match pattern behavior while the
    latter alter the action that is taken after substitution.</p>

  <dt><b>`U{n}'</b></dt>
  <dd>uses <b>n</b> as return code if the rule matches; the flag does not alter
      the recursive behavior of the rule, so, to have it performed only once, it
      must be used in combination with `:', e.g. <b>`:U{16}'</b> returns the
      value `16' after exactly one execution of the rule, if the pattern
      matches. As a consequence, its behavior is equivalent to `@', with the
      return code set to <b>n</b>; or, in other words, `@' is equivalent to
      `U{0}'. By convention, the freely available codes are above 16 included;
      the others are reserved.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The ordering of the flags can be significant. For instance:
    `IG{2}' means ignore errors and jump two lines ahead both in case of match
    and in case of error, while `G{2}I' means ignore errors, but jump two lines
    ahead only in case of match.</p>
<p class="Pp">More flags (mainly Action Flags) will be added as needed.</p>

# dereferenced, while the filter is decomposed in a
# prefix, in the value of the `uid=&lt;arg&gt;' AVA, and 
# in a suffix. A tag `&lt;&gt;' is appended to the DN. 
# If the DN refers to an entry in the `ou=admin' subtree, 
# the filter is rewritten OR-ing the `uid=&lt;arg&gt;' with
# `cn=&lt;arg&gt;'; otherwise it is left as is. This could be
# useful, for instance, to allow apache's auth_ldap-1.4
# module to authenticate users with both `uid' and
# `cn', but only if the request comes from a possible
# `cn=Web auth,ou=admin,dc=home,dc=net' user.
