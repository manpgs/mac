<p class="Pp">The gitweb CGI script for viewing Git repositories over the web
    uses a perl script fragment as its configuration file. You can set variables
    using &quot;<b>our $variable = value</b>&quot;; text from a &quot;#&quot;
    character until the end of a line is ignored. See <b>perlsyn</b>(1) for
    details.</p>
<p class="Pp">An example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre># gitweb configuration file for http://git.example.org
#
our $projectroot = &quot;/srv/git&quot;; # FHS recommendation
our $site_name = 'Example.org &gt;&gt; Repos';</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The configuration file is used to override the default settings
    that were built into gitweb at the time the <i>gitweb.cgi</i> script was
    generated.</p>
<p class="Pp">While one could just alter the configuration settings in the
    gitweb CGI itself, those changes would be lost upon upgrade. Configuration
    settings might also be placed into a file in the same directory as the CGI
    script with the default name <i>gitweb_config.perl</i> &#x2014; allowing one
    to have multiple gitweb instances with different configurations by the use
    of symlinks.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that some configuration can be controlled on per-repository
    rather than gitweb-wide basis: see &quot;Per-repository gitweb
    configuration&quot; subsection on <b>gitweb</b>(1) manpage.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DISCUSSION"><a class="permalink" href="#DISCUSSION">DISCUSSION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Gitweb reads configuration data from the following sources in the
    following order:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;built-in values (some set during build
  stage),</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;common system-wide configuration file (defaults
  to <b>/etc/gitweb-common.conf</b>),</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;either per-instance configuration file (defaults
  to <i>gitweb_config.perl</i> in the same directory as the installed gitweb),
  or if it does not exists then fallback system-wide configuration file
  (defaults to <b>/etc/gitweb.conf</b>).</div>
<p class="Pp">Values obtained in later configuration files override values
    obtained earlier in the above sequence.</p>
<p class="Pp">Locations of the common system-wide configuration file, the
    fallback system-wide configuration file and the per-instance configuration
    file are defined at compile time using build-time Makefile configuration
    variables, respectively <b>GITWEB_CONFIG_COMMON</b>,
    <b>GITWEB_CONFIG_SYSTEM</b> and <b>GITWEB_CONFIG</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also override locations of gitweb configuration files
    during runtime by setting the following environment variables:
    <b>GITWEB_CONFIG_COMMON</b>, <b>GITWEB_CONFIG_SYSTEM</b> and
    <b>GITWEB_CONFIG</b> to a non-empty value.</p>
<p class="Pp">The syntax of the configuration files is that of Perl, since these
    files are handled by sourcing them as fragments of Perl code (the language
    that gitweb itself is written in). Variables are typically set using the
    <b>our</b> qualifier (as in &quot;<b>our $variable =
    &lt;value&gt;;</b>&quot;) to avoid syntax errors if a new version of gitweb
    no longer uses a variable and therefore stops declaring it.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can include other configuration file using read_config_file()
    subroutine. For example, one might want to put gitweb configuration related
    to access control for viewing repositories via Gitolite (one of Git
    repository management tools) in a separate file, e.g. in
    <b>/etc/gitweb-gitolite.conf</b>. To include it, put</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>read_config_file(&quot;/etc/gitweb-gitolite.conf&quot;);</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">somewhere in gitweb configuration file used, e.g. in
    per-installation gitweb configuration file. Note that read_config_file()
    checks itself that the file it reads exists, and does nothing if it is not
    found. It also handles errors in included file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default configuration with no configuration file at all may
    work perfectly well for some installations. Still, a configuration file is
    useful for customizing or tweaking the behavior of gitweb in many ways, and
    some optional features will not be present unless explicitly enabled using
    the configurable <b>%features</b> variable (see also &quot;Configuring
    gitweb features&quot; section below).</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_VARIABLES"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION_VARIABLES">CONFIGURATION
  VARIABLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Some configuration variables have their default values (embedded
    in the CGI script) set during building gitweb &#x2014; if that is the case,
    this fact is put in their description. See gitweb&#x2019;s <i>INSTALL</i>
    file for instructions on building and installing gitweb.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Location_of_repositories"><a class="permalink" href="#Location_of_repositories">Location
  of repositories</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The configuration variables described below control how gitweb
    finds Git repositories, and how repositories are displayed and accessed.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also &quot;Repositories&quot; and later subsections in
    <b>gitweb</b>(1) manpage.</p>
<p class="Pp">$projectroot</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Absolute filesystem path which will be prepended to
  project path; the path to repository is <b>$projectroot/$project</b>. Set to
  <b>$GITWEB_PROJECTROOT</b> during installation. This variable has to be set
  correctly for gitweb to find repositories.
<p class="Pp">For example, if <b>$projectroot</b> is set to &quot;/srv/git&quot;
    by putting the following in gitweb config file:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>our $projectroot = &quot;/srv/git&quot;;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">then</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>http://git.example.com/gitweb.cgi?p=foo/bar.git</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">and its path_info based equivalent</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>http://git.example.com/gitweb.cgi/foo/bar.git</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">will map to the path <b>/srv/git/foo/bar.git</b> on the
    filesystem.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">$projects_list</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Name of a plain text file listing projects, or a name of
  directory to be scanned for projects.
<p class="Pp">Project list files should list one project per line, with each
    line having the following format</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>&lt;URI-encoded filesystem path to repository&gt; SP &lt;URI-encoded repository owner&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The default value of this variable is determined by the
    <b>GITWEB_LIST</b> makefile variable at installation time. If this variable
    is empty, gitweb will fall back to scanning the <b>$projectroot</b>
    directory for repositories.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">$project_maxdepth</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If <b>$projects_list</b> variable is unset, gitweb will
  recursively scan filesystem for Git repositories. The <b>$project_maxdepth</b>
  is used to limit traversing depth, relative to <b>$projectroot</b> (starting
  point); it means that directories which are further from <b>$projectroot</b>
  than <b>$project_maxdepth</b> will be skipped.
<p class="Pp">It is purely performance optimization, originally intended for
    MacOS X, where recursive directory traversal is slow. Gitweb follows
    symbolic links, but it detects cycles, ignoring any duplicate files and
    directories.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default value of this variable is determined by the build-time
    configuration variable <b>GITWEB_PROJECT_MAXDEPTH</b>, which defaults to
    2007.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">$export_ok</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show repository only if this file exists (in repository).
  Only effective if this variable evaluates to true. Can be set when building
  gitweb by setting <b>GITWEB_EXPORT_OK</b>. This path is relative to
  <b>GIT_DIR</b>. git-daemon[1] uses <i>git-daemon-export-ok</i>, unless started
  with <b>--export-all</b>. By default this variable is not set, which means
  that this feature is turned off.</div>
<p class="Pp">$export_auth_hook</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Function used to determine which repositories should be
  shown. This subroutine should take one parameter, the full path to a project,
  and if it returns true, that project will be included in the projects list and
  can be accessed through gitweb as long as it fulfills the other requirements
  described by $export_ok, $projects_list, and $projects_maxdepth. Example:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>our $export_auth_hook = sub { return -e &quot;$_[0]/git-daemon-export-ok&quot;; };</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">though the above might be done by using <b>$export_ok</b>
  instead</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>our $export_ok = &quot;git-daemon-export-ok&quot;;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If not set (default), it means that this feature is disabled.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also more involved example in &quot;Controlling access to Git
    repositories&quot; subsection on <b>gitweb</b>(1) manpage.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">$strict_export</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only allow viewing of repositories also shown on the
  overview page. This for example makes <b>$export_ok</b> file decide if
  repository is available and not only if it is shown. If <b>$projects_list</b>
  points to file with list of project, only those repositories listed would be
  available for gitweb. Can be set during building gitweb via
  <b>GITWEB_STRICT_EXPORT</b>. By default this variable is not set, which means
  that you can directly access those repositories that are hidden from projects
  list page (e.g. the are not listed in the $projects_list file).</div>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Finding_files"><a class="permalink" href="#Finding_files">Finding
  files</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The following configuration variables tell gitweb where to find
    files. The values of these variables are paths on the filesystem.</p>
<p class="Pp">$GIT</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Core git executable to use. By default set to
  <b>$GIT_BINDIR/git</b>, which in turn is by default set to
  <b>$(bindir)/git</b>. If you use Git installed from a binary package, you
  should usually set this to &quot;/usr/bin/git&quot;. This can just be
  &quot;git&quot; if your web server has a sensible PATH; from security point of
  view it is better to use absolute path to git binary. If you have multiple Git
  versions installed it can be used to choose which one to use. Must be
  (correctly) set for gitweb to be able to work.</div>
<p class="Pp">$mimetypes_file</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">File to use for (filename extension based) guessing of
  MIME types before trying <b>/etc/mime.types</b>. <b>NOTE</b> that this path,
  if relative, is taken as relative to the current Git repository, not to CGI
  script. If unset, only <b>/etc/mime.types</b> is used (if present on
  filesystem). If no mimetypes file is found, mimetype guessing based on
  extension of file is disabled. Unset by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">$highlight_bin</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Path to the highlight executable to use (it must be the
  one from <b>http://www.andre-simon.de</b> due to assumptions about parameters
  and output). By default set to <i>highlight</i>; set it to full path to
  highlight executable if it is not installed on your web server&#x2019;s PATH.
  Note that <i>highlight</i> feature must be set for gitweb to actually use
  syntax highlighting.
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b>: for a file to be highlighted, its syntax type must be
    detected and that syntax must be supported by &quot;highlight&quot;. The
    default syntax detection is minimal, and there are many supported syntax
    types with no detection by default. There are three options for adding
    syntax detection. The first and second priority are
    <b>%highlight_basename</b> and <b>%highlight_ext</b>, which detect based on
    basename (the full filename, for example &quot;Makefile&quot;) and extension
    (for example &quot;sh&quot;). The keys of these hashes are the basename and
    extension, respectively, and the value for a given key is the name of the
    syntax to be passed via <b>--syntax &lt;syntax&gt;</b> to
    &quot;highlight&quot;. The last priority is the &quot;highlight&quot;
    configuration of <b>Shebang</b> regular expressions to detect the language
    based on the first line in the file, (for example, matching the line
    &quot;#!/bin/bash&quot;). See the highlight documentation and the default
    config at /etc/highlight/filetypes.conf for more details.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example if repositories you are hosting use &quot;phtml&quot;
    extension for PHP files, and you want to have correct syntax-highlighting
    for those files, you can add the following to gitweb configuration:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>our %highlight_ext;
$highlight_ext{'phtml'} = 'php';</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Links_and_their_targets"><a class="permalink" href="#Links_and_their_targets">Links
  and their targets</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The configuration variables described below configure some of
    gitweb links: their target and their look (text or image), and where to find
    page prerequisites (stylesheet, favicon, images, scripts). Usually they are
    left at their default values, with the possible exception of
    <b>@stylesheets</b> variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">@stylesheets</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">List of URIs of stylesheets (relative to the base URI of
  a page). You might specify more than one stylesheet, for example to use
  &quot;gitweb.css&quot; as base with site specific modifications in a separate
  stylesheet to make it easier to upgrade gitweb. For example, you can add a
  <b>site</b> stylesheet by putting
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>push @stylesheets, &quot;gitweb-site.css&quot;;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">in the gitweb config file. Those values that are relative paths
    are relative to base URI of gitweb.</p>
<p class="Pp">This list should contain the URI of gitweb&#x2019;s standard
    stylesheet. The default URI of gitweb stylesheet can be set at build time
    using the <b>GITWEB_CSS</b> makefile variable. Its default value is
    <b>static/gitweb.css</b> (or <b>static/gitweb.min.css</b> if the
    <b>CSSMIN</b> variable is defined, i.e. if CSS minifier is used during
    build).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note</b>: there is also a legacy <b>$stylesheet</b>
    configuration variable, which was used by older gitweb. If
    <b>$stylesheet</b> variable is defined, only CSS stylesheet given by this
    variable is used by gitweb.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">$logo</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Points to the location where you put <i>git-logo.png</i>
  on your web server, or to be more the generic URI of logo, 72x27 size). This
  image is displayed in the top right corner of each gitweb page and used as a
  logo for the Atom feed. Relative to the base URI of gitweb (as a path). Can be
  adjusted when building gitweb using <b>GITWEB_LOGO</b> variable By default set
  to <b>static/git-logo.png</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">$favicon</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Points to the location where you put
  <i>git-favicon.png</i> on your web server, or to be more the generic URI of
  favicon, which will be served as &quot;image/png&quot; type. Web browsers that
  support favicons (website icons) may display them in the browser&#x2019;s URL
  bar and next to the site name in bookmarks. Relative to the base URI of
  gitweb. Can be adjusted at build time using <b>GITWEB_FAVICON</b> variable. By
  default set to <b>static/git-favicon.png</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">$javascript</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Points to the location where you put <i>gitweb.js</i> on
  your web server, or to be more generic the URI of JavaScript code used by
  gitweb. Relative to the base URI of gitweb. Can be set at build time using the
  <b>GITWEB_JS</b> build-time configuration variable.
<p class="Pp">The default value is either <b>static/gitweb.js</b>, or
    <b>static/gitweb.min.js</b> if the <b>JSMIN</b> build variable was defined,
    i.e. if JavaScript minifier was used at build time. <b>Note</b> that this
    single file is generated from multiple individual JavaScript
    &quot;modules&quot;.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">$home_link</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Target of the home link on the top of all pages (the
  first part of view &quot;breadcrumbs&quot;). By default it is set to the
  absolute URI of a current page (to the value of <b>$my_uri</b> variable, or to
  &quot;/&quot; if <b>$my_uri</b> is undefined or is an empty string).</div>
<p class="Pp">$home_link_str</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Label for the &quot;home link&quot; at the top of all
  pages, leading to <b>$home_link</b> (usually the main gitweb page, which
  contains the projects list). It is used as the first component of
  gitweb&#x2019;s &quot;breadcrumb trail&quot;: <b>&lt;home link&gt; /
  &lt;project&gt; / &lt;action&gt;</b>. Can be set at build time using the
  <b>GITWEB_HOME_LINK_STR</b> variable. By default it is set to
  &quot;projects&quot;, as this link leads to the list of projects. Another
  popular choice is to set it to the name of site. Note that it is treated as
  raw HTML so it should not be set from untrusted sources.</div>
<p class="Pp">@extra_breadcrumbs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Additional links to be added to the start of the
  breadcrumb trail before the home link, to pages that are logically
  &quot;above&quot; the gitweb projects list, such as the organization and
  department which host the gitweb server. Each element of the list is a
  reference to an array, in which element 0 is the link text (equivalent to
  <b>$home_link_str</b>) and element 1 is the target URL (equivalent to
  <b>$home_link</b>).
<p class="Pp">For example, the following setting produces a breadcrumb trail
    like &quot;home / dev / projects / ...&quot; where &quot;projects&quot; is
    the home link.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
    our @extra_breadcrumbs = (
      [ 'home' =&gt; 'https://www.example.org/' ],
      [ 'dev'  =&gt; 'https://dev.example.org/' ],
    );</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">$logo_url, $logo_label</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">URI and label (title) for the Git logo link (or your site
  logo, if you chose to use different logo image). By default, these both refer
  to Git homepage, <b>https://git-scm.com</b>; in the past, they pointed to Git
  documentation at <b>https://www.kernel.org</b>.</div>

    on its main page (which is the projects list page), etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">$site_name</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Name of your site or organization, to appear in page
  titles. Set it to something descriptive for clearer bookmarks etc. If this
  variable is not set or is, then gitweb uses the value of the
  <b>SERVER_NAME</b> <b>CGI</b> environment variable, setting site name to
  &quot;$SERVER_NAME Git&quot;, or &quot;Untitled Git&quot; if this variable is
  not set (e.g. if running gitweb as standalone script).
<p class="Pp">Can be set using the <b>GITWEB_SITENAME</b> at build time. Unset
    by default.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">$site_html_head_string</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">HTML snippet to be included in the &lt;head&gt; section
  of each page. Can be set using <b>GITWEB_SITE_HTML_HEAD_STRING</b> at build
  time. No default value.</div>
<p class="Pp">$site_header</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Name of a file with HTML to be included at the top of

  value.</div>
<p class="Pp">$home_text</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Name of a HTML file which, if it exists, is included on
  the gitweb projects overview page (&quot;projects_list&quot; view). Relative

  set to <i>indextext.html</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">$projects_list_description_width</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The width (in characters) of the &quot;Description&quot;
  column of the projects list. Longer descriptions will be truncated (trying to
  cut at word boundary); the full description is available in the <i>title</i>
  attribute (usually shown on mouseover). The default is 25, which might be too
  small if you use long project descriptions.</div>
<p class="Pp">$default_projects_order</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Default value of ordering of projects on projects list
  page, which means the ordering used if you don&#x2019;t explicitly sort
  projects list (if there is no &quot;o&quot; CGI query parameter in the URL).
  Valid values are &quot;none&quot; (unsorted), &quot;project&quot; (projects
  are by project name, i.e. path to repository relative to <b>$projectroot</b>),
  &quot;descr&quot; (project description), &quot;owner&quot;, and

<div class="Bd-indent">Default mimetype for the blob_plain (raw) view, if
  mimetype checking doesn&#x2019;t result in some other type; by default
  &quot;text/plain&quot;. Gitweb guesses mimetype of a file to display based on
  extension of its filename, using <b>$mimetypes_file</b> (if set and file

<p class="Pp">$fallback_encoding</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Gitweb assumes this charset when a line contains
  non-UTF-8 characters. The fallback decoding is used without error checking, so
  it can be even &quot;utf-8&quot;. The value must be a valid encoding; see the
  <b>Encoding::Supported</b>(3pm) man page for a list. The default is

  detection.
<p class="Pp"><b>Note</b> that rename and especially copy detection can be quite

    side effect affects how &quot;summary&quot; pages look like, or load
    limiting).</p>
<p class="Pp">@git_base_url_list</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">List of Git base URLs. These URLs are used to generate
  URLs describing from where to fetch a project, which are shown on project
  summary page. The full fetch URL is &quot;<b>$git_base_url/$project</b>&quot;,
  for each element of this list. You can set up multiple base URLs (for example
  one for <b>git://</b> protocol, and one for <b>http://</b> protocol).
<p class="Pp">Note that per repository configuration can be set in
    <b>$GIT_DIR/cloneurl</b> file, or as values of multi-value <b>gitweb.url</b>
    configuration variable in project config. Per-repository configuration takes
    precedence over value composed from <b>@git_base_url_list</b> elements and
    project name.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can setup one single value (single entry/item in this list) at
    build time by setting the <b>GITWEB_BASE_URL</b> build-time configuration
    variable. By default it is set to (), i.e. an empty list. This means that
    gitweb would not try to create project URL (to fetch) from project name.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">$projects_list_group_categories</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether to enable the grouping of projects by category on
  the project list page. The category of a project is determined by the
  <b>$GIT_DIR/category</b> file or the <b>gitweb.category</b> variable in each
  repository&#x2019;s configuration. Disabled by default (set to 0).</div>
<p class="Pp">$project_list_default_category</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Default category for projects for which none is
  specified. If this is set to the empty string, such projects will remain
  uncategorized and listed at the top, above categorized projects. Used only if
  project categories are enabled, which means if
  <b>$projects_list_group_categories</b> is true. By default set to &quot;&quot;
  (empty string).</div>
<p class="Pp">$prevent_xss</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, some gitweb features are disabled to prevent
  content in repositories from launching cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Set
  this to true if you don&#x2019;t trust the content of your repositories. False
  by default (set to 0).</div>
<p class="Pp">$maxload</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Used to set the maximum load that we will still respond
  to gitweb queries. If the server load exceeds this value then gitweb will
  return &quot;503 Service Unavailable&quot; error. The server load is taken to
  be 0 if gitweb cannot determine its value. Currently it works only on Linux,
  where it uses <b>/proc/loadavg</b>; the load there is the number of active
  tasks on the system &#x2014; processes that are actually running &#x2014;
  averaged over the last minute.
<p class="Pp">Set <b>$maxload</b> to undefined value (<b>undef</b>) to turn this
    feature off. The default value is 300.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">$omit_age_column</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, omit the column with date of the most current
  commit on the projects list page. It can save a bit of I/O and a fork per
  repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">$omit_owner</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true prevents displaying information about repository
  owner.</div>
<p class="Pp">$per_request_config</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If this is set to code reference, it will be run once for
  each request. You can set parts of configuration that change per session this
  way. For example, one might use the following code in a gitweb configuration
  file
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>our $per_request_config = sub {
        $ENV{GL_USER} = $cgi-&gt;remote_user || &quot;gitweb&quot;;
};</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If <b>$per_request_config</b> is not a code reference, it is
    interpreted as boolean value. If it is true gitweb will process config files
    once per request, and if it is false gitweb will process config files only
    once, each time it is executed. True by default (set to 1).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b>: <b>$my_url</b>, <b>$my_uri</b>, and <b>$base_url</b>
    are overwritten with their default values before every request, so if you
    want to change them, be sure to set this variable to true or a code
    reference effecting the desired changes.</p>
<p class="Pp">This variable matters only when using persistent web environments
    that serve multiple requests using single gitweb instance, like mod_perl,
    FastCGI or Plackup.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Other_variables"><a class="permalink" href="#Other_variables">Other
  variables</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Usually you should not need to change (adjust) any of
    configuration variables described below; they should be automatically set by
    gitweb to correct value.</p>
<p class="Pp">$version</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Gitweb version, set automatically when creating
  gitweb.cgi from gitweb.perl. You might want to modify it if you are running
  modified gitweb, for example
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>our $version .= &quot; with caching&quot;;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">if you run modified version of gitweb with caching support. This
    variable is purely informational, used e.g. in the &quot;generator&quot;
    meta header in HTML header.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">$my_url, $my_uri</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Full URL and absolute URL of the gitweb script; in
  earlier versions of gitweb you might have need to set those variables, but now
  there should be no need to do it. See <b>$per_request_config</b> if you need
  to set them still.</div>
<p class="Pp">$base_url</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Base URL for relative URLs in pages generated by gitweb,
  (e.g. <b>$logo</b>, <b>$favicon</b>, <b>@stylesheets</b> if they are relative
  URLs), needed and used <i>&lt;base href=&quot;$base_url&quot;&gt;</i> only for
  URLs with nonempty PATH_INFO. Usually gitweb sets its value correctly, and
  there is no need to set this variable, e.g. to $my_uri or &quot;/&quot;. See
  <b>$per_request_config</b> if you need to override it anyway.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURING_GITWEB_FEATURES"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURING_GITWEB_FEATURES">CONFIGURING
  GITWEB FEATURES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Many gitweb features can be enabled (or disabled) and configured
    using the <b>%feature</b> hash. Names of gitweb features are keys of this
    hash.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each <b>%feature</b> hash element is a hash reference and has the
    following structure:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>&quot;&lt;feature_name&gt;&quot; =&gt; {
        &quot;sub&quot; =&gt; &lt;feature-sub (subroutine)&gt;,
        &quot;override&quot; =&gt; &lt;allow-override (boolean)&gt;,
        &quot;default&quot; =&gt; [ &lt;options&gt;... ]
},</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Some features cannot be overridden per project. For those features
    the structure of appropriate <b>%feature</b> hash element has a simpler
    form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>&quot;&lt;feature_name&gt;&quot; =&gt; {
        &quot;override&quot; =&gt; 0,
        &quot;default&quot; =&gt; [ &lt;options&gt;... ]
},</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">As one can see it lacks the 'sub' element.</p>
<p class="Pp">The meaning of each part of feature configuration is described
    below:</p>
<p class="Pp">default</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">List (array reference) of feature parameters (if there
  are any), used also to toggle (enable or disable) given feature.
<p class="Pp">Note that it is currently <b>always</b> an array reference, even
    if feature doesn&#x2019;t accept any configuration parameters, and 'default'
    is used only to turn it on or off. In such case you turn feature on by
    setting this element to <b>[1]</b>, and torn it off by setting it to
    <b>[0]</b>. See also the passage about the &quot;blame&quot; feature in the
    &quot;Examples&quot; section.</p>
<p class="Pp">To disable features that accept parameters (are configurable), you
    need to set this element to empty list i.e. <b>[]</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">override</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If this field has a true value then the given feature is
  overridable, which means that it can be configured (or enabled/disabled) on a
  per-repository basis.
<p class="Pp">Usually given &quot;&lt;feature&gt;&quot; is configurable via the
    <b>gitweb.&lt;feature&gt;</b> config variable in the per-repository Git
    configuration file.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note</b> that no feature is overridable by default.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">sub</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Internal detail of implementation. What is important is
  that if this field is not present then per-repository override for given
  feature is not supported.
<p class="Pp">You wouldn&#x2019;t need to ever change it in gitweb config
  file.</p>
</div>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Features_in_"><a class="permalink" href="#Features_in_">Features
  in <b>%feature</b></a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The gitweb features that are configurable via <b>%feature</b> hash
    are listed below. This should be a complete list, but ultimately the
    authoritative and complete list is in gitweb.cgi source code, with features
    described in the comments.</p>
<p class="Pp">blame</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable the &quot;blame&quot; and
  &quot;blame_incremental&quot; blob views, showing for each line the last
  commit that modified it; see <b>git-blame</b>(1). This can be very
  CPU-intensive and is therefore disabled by default.
<p class="Pp">This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis via
    repository&#x2019;s <b>gitweb.blame</b> configuration variable
  (boolean).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">snapshot</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable and configure the &quot;snapshot&quot; action,
  which allows user to download a compressed archive of any tree or commit, as
  produced by <b>git-archive</b>(1) and possibly additionally compressed. This
  can potentially generate high traffic if you have large project.
<p class="Pp">The value of 'default' is a list of names of snapshot formats,
    defined in <b>%known_snapshot_formats</b> hash, that you wish to offer.
    Supported formats include &quot;tgz&quot;, &quot;tbz2&quot;, &quot;txz&quot;
    (gzip/bzip2/xz compressed tar archive) and &quot;zip&quot;; please consult
    gitweb sources for a definitive list. By default only &quot;tgz&quot; is
    offered.</p>
<p class="Pp">This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis via
    repository&#x2019;s <b>gitweb.snapshot</b> configuration variable, which
    contains a comma separated list of formats or &quot;none&quot; to disable
    snapshots. Unknown values are ignored.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">grep</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable grep search, which lists the files in currently
  selected tree (directory) containing the given string; see <b>git-grep</b>(1).
  This can be potentially CPU-intensive, of course. Enabled by default.
<p class="Pp">This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis via
    repository&#x2019;s <b>gitweb.grep</b> configuration variable (boolean).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">pickaxe</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable the so called pickaxe search, which will list the
  commits that introduced or removed a given string in a file. This can be
  practical and quite faster alternative to &quot;blame&quot; action, but it is
  still potentially CPU-intensive. Enabled by default.
<p class="Pp">The pickaxe search is described in <b>git-log</b>(1) (the
    description of <b>-S&lt;string&gt;</b> option, which refers to pickaxe entry
    in <b>gitdiffcore</b>(7) for more details).</p>
<p class="Pp">This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis by
    setting repository&#x2019;s <b>gitweb.pickaxe</b> configuration variable
    (boolean).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">show-sizes</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable showing size of blobs (ordinary files) in a
  &quot;tree&quot; view, in a separate column, similar to what <b>ls -l</b>
  does; see description of <b>-l</b> option in <b>git-ls-tree</b>(1) manpage.
  This costs a bit of I/O. Enabled by default.
<p class="Pp">This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis via
    repository&#x2019;s <b>gitweb.showSizes</b> configuration variable
    (boolean).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">patches</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable and configure &quot;patches&quot; view, which
  displays list of commits in email (plain text) output format; see also
  <b>git-format-patch</b>(1). The value is the maximum number of patches in a
  patchset generated in &quot;patches&quot; view. Set the <i>default</i> field
  to a list containing single item of or to an empty list to disable patch view,
  or to a list containing a single negative number to remove any limit. Default
  value is 16.
<p class="Pp">This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis via
    repository&#x2019;s <b>gitweb.patches</b> configuration variable
  (integer).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">avatar</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Avatar support. When this feature is enabled, views such
  as &quot;shortlog&quot; or &quot;commit&quot; will display an avatar
  associated with the email of each committer and author.
<p class="Pp">Currently available providers are <b>&quot;gravatar&quot;</b> and
    <b>&quot;picon&quot;</b>. Only one provider at a time can be selected
    (<i>default</i> is one element list). If an unknown provider is specified,
    the feature is disabled. <b>Note</b> that some providers might require extra
    Perl packages to be installed; see <b>gitweb/INSTALL</b> for more
  details.</p>
<p class="Pp">This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis via
    repository&#x2019;s <b>gitweb.avatar</b> configuration variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also <b>%avatar_size</b> with pixel sizes for icons and
    avatars (&quot;default&quot; is used for one-line like &quot;log&quot; and
    &quot;shortlog&quot;, &quot;double&quot; is used for two-line like
    &quot;commit&quot;, &quot;commitdiff&quot; or &quot;tag&quot;). If the
    default font sizes or lineheights are changed (e.g. via adding extra CSS
    stylesheet in <b>@stylesheets</b>), it may be appropriate to change these
    values.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">email-privacy</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Redact e-mail addresses from the generated HTML, etc.
  content. This obscures e-mail addresses retrieved from the author/committer
  and comment sections of the Git log. It is meant to hinder web crawlers that
  harvest and abuse addresses. Such crawlers may not respect robots.txt. Note
  that users and user tools also see the addresses as redacted. If Gitweb is not
  the final step in a workflow then subsequent steps may misbehave because of
  the redacted information they receive. Disabled by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">highlight</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Server-side syntax highlight support in &quot;blob&quot;
  view. It requires <b>$highlight_bin</b> program to be available (see the
  description of this variable in the &quot;Configuration variables&quot;
  section above), and therefore is disabled by default.
<p class="Pp">This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis via
    repository&#x2019;s <b>gitweb.highlight</b> configuration variable
    (boolean).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">remote_heads</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable displaying remote heads (remote-tracking branches)
  in the &quot;heads&quot; list. In most cases the list of remote-tracking
  branches is an unnecessary internal private detail, and this feature is
  therefore disabled by default. <b>git-instaweb</b>(1), which is usually used
  to browse local repositories, enables and uses this feature.
<p class="Pp">This feature can be configured on a per-repository basis via
    repository&#x2019;s <b>gitweb.remote_heads</b> configuration variable
    (boolean).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The remaining features cannot be overridden on a per project
    basis.</p>
<p class="Pp">search</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable text search, which will list the commits which
  match author, committer or commit text to a given string; see the description
  of <b>--author</b>, <b>--committer</b> and <b>--grep</b> options in
  <b>git-log</b>(1) manpage. Enabled by default.
<p class="Pp">Project specific override is not supported.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">forks</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If this feature is enabled, gitweb considers projects in
  subdirectories of project root (basename) to be forks of existing projects.
  For each project <b>$projname.git</b>, projects in the <b>$projname/</b>
  directory and its subdirectories will not be shown in the main projects list.
  Instead, a '+' mark is shown next to <b>$projname</b>, which links to a
  &quot;forks&quot; view that lists all the forks (all projects in
  <b>$projname/</b> subdirectory). Additionally a &quot;forks&quot; view for a
  project is linked from project summary page.
<p class="Pp">If the project list is taken from a file (<b>$projects_list</b>
    points to a file), forks are only recognized if they are listed after the
    main project in that file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Project specific override is not supported.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">actions</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Insert custom links to the action bar of all project
  pages. This allows you to link to third-party scripts integrating into gitweb.
<p class="Pp">The &quot;default&quot; value consists of a list of triplets in
    the form &#x2018;(&quot;&lt;label&gt;&quot;, &quot;&lt;link&gt;&quot;,
    &quot;&lt;position&gt;&quot;)` where &quot;position&quot; is the label after
    which to insert the link, &quot;link&quot; is a format string where
    <b>%n</b> expands to the project name, <b>%f</b> to the project path within
    the filesystem (i.e. &quot;$projectroot/$project&quot;), <b>%h</b> to the
    current hash ('h&#x2019; gitweb parameter) and &#x2018;%b` to the current
    hash base ('hb&#x2019; gitweb parameter); &#x2018;%%` expands to
  '%&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, at the time this page was written, the
    <b>http://repo.or.cz</b> Git hosting site set it to the following to enable
    graphical log (using the third party tool <b>git-browser</b>):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$feature{'actions'}{'default'} =
        [ ('graphiclog', '/git-browser/by-commit.html?r=%n', 'summary')];</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This adds a link titled &quot;graphiclog&quot; after the
    &quot;summary&quot; link, leading to <b>git-browser</b> script, passing
    <b>r=&lt;project&gt;</b> as a query parameter.</p>
<p class="Pp">Project specific override is not supported.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">timed</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable displaying how much time and how many Git commands
  it took to generate and display each page in the page footer (at the bottom of
  page). For example the footer might contain: &quot;This page took 6.53325
  seconds and 13 Git commands to generate.&quot; Disabled by default.
<p class="Pp">Project specific override is not supported.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">javascript-timezone</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable and configure the ability to change a common time
  zone for dates in gitweb output via JavaScript. Dates in gitweb output include
  authordate and committerdate in &quot;commit&quot;, &quot;commitdiff&quot; and
  &quot;log&quot; views, and taggerdate in &quot;tag&quot; view. Enabled by
  default.
<p class="Pp">The value is a list of three values: a default time zone (for if
    the client hasn&#x2019;t selected some other time zone and saved it in a
    cookie), a name of cookie where to store selected time zone, and a CSS class
    used to mark up dates for manipulation. If you want to turn this feature
    off, set &quot;default&quot; to empty list: <b>[]</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Typical gitweb config files will only change starting (default)
    time zone, and leave other elements at their default values:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$feature{'javascript-timezone'}{'default'}[0] = &quot;utc&quot;;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The example configuration presented here is guaranteed to be
    backwards and forward compatible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Time zone values can be &quot;local&quot; (for local time zone
    that browser uses), &quot;utc&quot; (what gitweb uses when JavaScript or
    this feature is disabled), or numerical time zones in the form of
    &quot;+/-HHMM&quot;, such as &quot;+0200&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Project specific override is not supported.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">extra-branch-refs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">List of additional directories under &quot;refs&quot;
  which are going to be used as branch refs. For example if you have a gerrit
  setup where all branches under refs/heads/ are official, push-after-review
  ones and branches under refs/sandbox/, refs/wip and refs/other are user ones
  where permissions are much wider, then you might want to set this variable as
  follows:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$feature{'extra-branch-refs'}{'default'} =
        ['sandbox', 'wip', 'other'];</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This feature can be configured on per-repository basis after
    setting $feature{<i>extra-branch-refs</i>}{<i>override</i>} to true, via
    repository&#x2019;s <b>gitweb.extraBranchRefs</b> configuration variable,
    which contains a space separated list of refs. An example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>[gitweb]
        extraBranchRefs = sandbox wip other</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The gitweb.extraBranchRefs is actually a multi-valued
    configuration variable, so following example is also correct and the result
    is the same as of the snippet above:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>[gitweb]
        extraBranchRefs = sandbox
        extraBranchRefs = wip other</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">It is an error to specify a ref that does not pass &quot;git
    check-ref-format&quot; scrutiny. Duplicated values are filtered.</p>

<p class="Pp">To enable blame, pickaxe search, and snapshot support (allowing
