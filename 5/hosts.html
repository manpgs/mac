<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">hosts</code> file contains information
    regarding the known hosts on the network. For each host a single line should
    be present with the following information:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>Internet address
Official host name
Aliases</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab characters.
    A ``#'' indicates the beginning of a comment; characters up to the end of
    the line are not interpreted by routines which search the file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Network addresses may either be specified for IP version 4 or
    version 6. IP version 4 addresses are specified in the conventional dotted
    address notation. IP version 6 addresses are specified using the
    colon-separated notation described in RFC1924.</p>
<p class="Pp">Host names may contain any printable character other than a field
    delimiter, newline, or comment character.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">hosts</code> file is read by
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/mDNSResponder">mDNSResponder(8)</a> and used to
    supply results for calls to
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/getaddrinfo">getaddrinfo(3)</a>,
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/getnameinfo">getnameinfo(3)</a>, etc. in addition
