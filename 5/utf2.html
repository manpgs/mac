<div class="Bf Em">The UTF2 encoding has been deprecated in favour of
  UTF-8.</div>
<p class="Pp">New applications should not use UTF2.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="Plan">The <code class="Nm">UTF2</code> encoding is based on a
    proposed X-Open multibyte FSS-UCS-TF (File System Safe Universal Character
    Set Transformation Format) encoding as used in
    <a class="permalink" href="#Plan"><b class="Sy">Plan 9 from Bell
    Labs</b></a>. Although it is capable of representing more than 16 bits, the
    current implementation is limited to 16 bits as defined by the Unicode
    Standard.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">UTF2</code> representation is backwards
    compatible with ASCII, so 0x00-0x7f refer to the ASCII character set. The
    multibyte encoding of runes between 0x0080 and 0xffff consist entirely of
    bytes whose high order bit is set. The actual encoding is represented by the
    following table:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Li">
<pre>[0x0000 - 0x007f] [00000000.0bbbbbbb] -&gt; 0bbbbbbb
[0x0080 - 0x07ff] [00000bbb.bbbbbbbb] -&gt; 110bbbbb, 10bbbbbb
[0x0800 - 0xffff] [bbbbbbbb.bbbbbbbb] -&gt; 1110bbbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If more than a single representation of a value exists (for
    example, 0x00; 0xC0 0x80; 0xE0 0x80 0x80) the shortest representation is
    always used (but the longer ones will be correctly decoded).</p>
<p class="Pp">The final three encodings provided by X-Open:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Li">
<pre>[00000000.000bbbbb.bbbbbbbb.bbbbbbbb] -&gt;
	11110bbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb, 10bbbbbb

[000000bb.bbbbbbbb.bbbbbbbb.bbbbbbbb] -&gt;
