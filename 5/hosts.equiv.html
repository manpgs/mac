<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">hosts.equiv</code> and
    <code class="Nm">.rhosts</code> files list hosts and users which are
    ``trusted'' by the local host when a connection is made via
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/rlogind">rlogind(8)</a>,
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/rshd">rshd(8)</a>, or any other server that uses
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/ruserok">ruserok(3)</a>. This mechanism bypasses
    password checks, and is required for access via
    <a class="Xr" href="../1/rsh">rsh(1)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each line of these files has the format:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent">
<pre>
hostname [username]
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp" id="hostname">The
    <a class="permalink" href="#hostname"><i class="Em">hostname</i></a> may be
    specified as a host name (typically a fully qualified host name in a DNS
    environment) or address, <i class="Em">+@netgroup</i> (from which only the
    host names are checked), or a ``+'' wildcard (allow all hosts).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i class="Em">username</i>, if specified, may be given as a
    user name on the remote host, <i class="Em">+@netgroup</i> (from which only
    the user names are checked), or a ``+'' wildcard (allow all remote
  users).</p>
<p class="Pp">If a <i class="Em">username</i> is specified, only that user from
    the specified host may login to the local machine. If a
    <i class="Em">username</i> is not specified, any user may login with the
    same user name.</p>

<p class="Pp"><code class="Li">somehost</code></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent">A common usage: users on <i class="Em">somehost</i>
  may login to the local host as the same user name.</div>
<code class="Li">somehost username</code>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent">The user <i class="Em">username</i> on
  <i class="Em">somehost</i> may login to the local host. If specified in
  <i class="Em">/etc/hosts.equiv</i>, the user may login with only the same user
  name.</div>
<code class="Li">+@anetgroup username</code>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent">The user <i class="Em">username</i> may login to the
  local host from any machine listed in the netgroup
  <a class="permalink" href="#anetgroup"><i class="Em" id="anetgroup">anetgroup</i></a>.</div>
<div class="Bd">
<pre>

<div class="Bd Bd-indent">Two severe security hazards. In the first case, allows
  a user on any machine to login to the local host as the same user name. In the
  second case, allows any user on any machine to login to the local host (as any
  user, if in <i class="Em">/etc/hosts.equiv</i>).</div>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="WARNINGS"><a class="permalink" href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The username checks provided by this mechanism are
    <a class="permalink" href="#not"><i class="Em" id="not">not</i></a> secure,
    as the remote user name is received by the server unchecked for validity.
    Therefore this mechanism should only be used in an environment where all
    hosts are completely trusted.</p>
<p class="Pp">A numeric host address instead of a host name can help security
    considerations somewhat; the address is then used directly by
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/iruserok">iruserok(3)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="any">When a username (or netgroup, or +) is specified in
    <i class="Em">/etc/hosts.equiv</i>, that user (or group of users, or all
    users, respectively) may login to the local host as
    <a class="permalink" href="#any"><i class="Em">any local user</i></a>.
    Usernames in <i class="Em">/etc/hosts.equiv</i> should therefore be used
    with extreme caution, or not at all.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i class="Em">.rhosts</i> file must be owned by the user whose
    home directory it resides in, and must be writable only by that user.</p>
<p class="Pp">Logins as root only check root's <i class="Em">.rhosts</i> file;
    the <i class="Em">/etc/hosts.equiv</i> file is not checked for security.
    Access permitted through root's <i class="Em">.rhosts</i> file is typically
    only for <a class="Xr" href="../1/rsh">rsh(1)</a>, as root must still login
    on the console for an interactive login such as
    <a class="Xr" href="../1/rlogin">rlogin(1)</a>.</p>
