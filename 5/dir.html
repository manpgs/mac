<p class="Pp">Directories provide a convenient hierarchical method of grouping
    files while obscuring the underlying details of the storage medium. A
    directory file is differentiated from a plain file by a flag in its
    <a class="Xr" href="../5/inode">inode(5)</a> entry. It consists of records
    (directory entries) each of which contains information about a file and a
    pointer to the file itself. Directory entries may contain other directories
    as well as plain files; such nested directories are refered to as
    subdirectories. A hierarchy of directories and files is formed in this
    manner and is called a file system (or referred to as a file system
  tree).</p>
<p class="Pp">Each directory file contains two special directory entries; one is
    a pointer to the directory itself called dot
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">.</code>&#x2019; and the other a pointer to its
    parent directory called dot-dot &#x2018;<code class="Li">..</code>&#x2019;.
    Dot and dot-dot are valid pathnames, however, the system root directory
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">/</code>&#x2019;, has no parent and dot-dot points
    to itself like dot.</p>
<p class="Pp">File system nodes are ordinary directory files on which has been
    grafted a file system object, such as a physical disk or a partitioned area
    of such a disk. (See <a class="Xr" href="../1/mount">mount(1)</a> and
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/mount">mount(8)</a>.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The directory entry format is defined in the file
    &#x27E8;sys/dirent.h&#x27E9; and further in the file
    &#x27E8;dirent.h&#x27E9;. When the macro
    <code class="Dv">_DARWIN_FEATURE_64_BIT_INODE</code> is not defined (see
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/stat">stat(2)</a> for more information on this
    macro), the <var class="Fa">dirent</var> structure is defined as:</p>

/*
 * The dirent structure defines the format of directory entries.
 *
 * A directory entry has a struct dirent at the front of it, containing its
 * inode number, the length of the entry, and the length of the name
 * contained in the entry.  These are followed by the name padded to a 4
 * byte boundary with null bytes.  All names are guaranteed null terminated.
 * The maximum length of a name in a directory is 255.
