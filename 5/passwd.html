<p class="Pp">The /etc/passwd file is a legacy BSD 4.3 format file. It is mostly
    unused, but is updated by some utility programs. Its format is similar to
    the /etc/master.passwd file, except that it does not contain the
    <var class="Ar">class</var>, <var class="Ar">change</var>, and
    <var class="Ar">expire</var> fields described below.</p>
<p class="Pp">The /etc/master.passwd file comprises newline separated records,
    one per user. Each line contains ten colon (``:'') separated fields. These
    fields are as follows:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>name</dt>
  <dd>User's login name.</dd>
  <dt>password</dt>
  <dd>User's <i class="Em">encrypted</i> password.</dd>
  <dt>uid</dt>
  <dd>User's id.</dd>
  <dt>gid</dt>
  <dd>User's login group id.</dd>
  <dt>class</dt>
  <dd>User's general classification (unused).</dd>
  <dt>change</dt>
  <dd>Password change time.</dd>
  <dt>expire</dt>
  <dd>Account expiration time.</dd>
  <dt>gecos</dt>
  <dd>User's full name.</dd>
  <dt>home_dir</dt>
  <dd>User's home directory.</dd>
  <dt>shell</dt>
  <dd>User's login shell.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">name</var> field is the login used to access
    the computer account, and the <var class="Ar">uid</var> field is the number
    associated with it. They should both be unique across the system (and often
    across a group of systems) since they control file access.</p>
<p class="Pp">While it is possible to have multiple entries with identical login
    names and/or identical user id's, it is usually a mistake to do so. Routines
    that manipulate these files will often return only one of the multiple
    entries, and that one by random selection.</p>
<p class="Pp">The login name must never begin with a hyphen (``-''); also, it is
    strongly suggested that neither upper-case characters or dots (``.'') be
    part of the name, as this tends to confuse mailers. No field may contain a
    colon (``:'') as this has been used historically to separate the fields in
    the user database.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">password</var> field is the
    <i class="Em">encrypted</i> form of the password. If the
    <var class="Ar">password</var> field is empty, no password will be required
    to gain access to the machine. This is almost invariably a mistake. Because
    these files contain the encrypted user passwords, they should not be
    readable by anyone without appropriate privileges.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">group</var> field is the group that the user
    will be placed in upon login. Since this system supports multiple groups
    (see <a class="Xr" href="../1/groups">groups(1)</a>) this field currently
    has little special meaning.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">class</var> field is currently unused.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">change</var> field is the number in seconds,
    <code class="Dv">GMT</code>, from the epoch, until the password for the
    account must be changed. This field may be left empty to turn off the
    password aging feature.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">expire</var> field is the number in seconds,
    <code class="Dv">GMT</code>, from the epoch, until the account expires. This
    field may be left empty to turn off the account aging feature.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">gecos</var> field normally contains the user's
    full name. Note that Mac OS X differs from some other operating systems,
    where the <var class="Ar">gecos</var> field may contain other
    comma-separcted information about the user.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">home_dir</var> field is the user's home
    directory. This is the full path name where the user will be placed on
    login.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">shell</var> field is the command interpreter
    the user prefers. If there is nothing in the <var class="Ar">shell</var>
    field, the Bourne shell (<span class="Pa">/bin/sh</span>) is assumed.</p>

<p class="Pp">Processes generally find user records using one of the
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/getpwent">getpwent(3)</a> family of functions. On
    Mac OS X, these functions interact with the
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/DirectoryService">DirectoryService(8)</a> daemon,
    which reads the /etc/master.passwd file as well as searching other directory
    information services to find user accounts.</p>
