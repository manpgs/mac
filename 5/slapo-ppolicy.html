<p class="Pp">The <b>ppolicy</b> overlay is an implementation of the most recent
    IETF Password Policy proposal for LDAP. When instantiated, it intercepts,
    decodes and applies specific password policy controls to overall use of a
    backend database, changes to user password fields, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">The overlay provides a variety of password control mechanisms.
    They include password aging -- both minimum and maximum ages, password reuse
    and duplication control, account time-outs, mandatory password resets,
    acceptable password content, and even grace logins. Different groups of
    users may be associated with different password policies, and there is no
    limit to the number of password policies that may be created.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that some of the policies do not take effect when the
    operation is performed with the <b>rootdn</b> identity; all the operations,
    when performed with any other identity, may be subjected to constraints,
    like access control.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the IETF Password Policy proposal for LDAP makes sense
    when considering a single-valued password attribute, while the userPassword
    attribute allows multiple values. This implementation enforces a single
    value for the userPassword attribute, despite its specification.</p>

<p class="Pp">These <b>slapd.conf</b> configuration options apply to the ppolicy

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="ppolicy_default"><a class="permalink" href="#ppolicy_default"><b>ppolicy_default
    &lt;policyDN&gt;</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Specify the DN of the pwdPolicy object to use when no specific policy is
      set on a given user's entry. If there is no specific policy for an entry
      and no default is given, then no policies will be enforced.</dd>
  <dt id="ppolicy_forward_updates"><a class="permalink" href="#ppolicy_forward_updates"><b>ppolicy_forward_updates</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Specify that policy state changes that result from Bind operations (such
      as recording failures, lockout, etc.) on a consumer should be forwarded to
      a master instead of being written directly into the consumer's local
      database. This setting is only useful on a replication consumer, and also
      requires the <b>updateref</b> setting and <b>chain</b> overlay to be
      appropriately configured.</dd>
  <dt id="ppolicy_hash_cleartext"><a class="permalink" href="#ppolicy_hash_cleartext"><b>ppolicy_hash_cleartext</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Specify that cleartext passwords present in Add and Modify requests should
      be hashed before being stored in the database. This violates the
      X.500/LDAP information model, but may be needed to compensate for LDAP
      clients that don't use the Password Modify extended operation to manage
      passwords. It is recommended that when this option is used that compare,
      search, and read access be denied to all directory users.</dd>
  <dt id="ppolicy_use_lockout"><a class="permalink" href="#ppolicy_use_lockout"><b>ppolicy_use_lockout</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A client will always receive an LDAP <b>InvalidCredentials</b> response
      when Binding to a locked account. By default, when a Password Policy
      control was provided on the Bind request, a Password Policy response will
      be included with no special error code set. This option changes the
      Password Policy response to include the <b>AccountLocked</b> error code.
      Note that sending the <b>AccountLocked</b> error code provides useful
      information to an attacker; sites that are sensitive to security issues
      should not enable this option.
