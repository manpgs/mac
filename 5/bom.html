<p class="Pp">The Mac OS X Installer uses a file system &quot;bill of
    materials&quot; to determine which files to install, remove, or upgrade. A
    bill of materials, <code class="Nm">bom</code>, contains all the files
    within a directory, along with some information about each file. File
    information includes: the file's UNIX permissions, its owner and group, its
    size, its time of last modification, and so on. Also included are a checksum
    of each file and information about hard links.</p>
<p class="Pp">The bill of materials for installed packages are found within the
    package receipts located in /Library/Receipts.</p>
