<p class="Pp">The Git pack format is now Git stores most of its primary
    repository data. Over the lietime af a repository loose objects (if any) and
    smaller packs are consolidated into larger pack(s). See <b>git-gc</b>(1) and
    <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">The pack format is also used over-the-wire, see e.g.
    <b>gitprotocol-v2</b>(5), as well as being a part of other container formats
    in the case of <b>gitformat-bundle</b>(5).</p>

<p class="Pp">In a repository using the traditional SHA-1, pack checksums, index
    checksums, and object IDs (object names) mentioned below are all computed
    using SHA-1. Similarly, in SHA-256 repositories, these values are computed
    using SHA-256.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Size_encoding"><a class="permalink" href="#Size_encoding">Size
  encoding</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This document uses the following &quot;size encoding&quot; of
    non-negative integers: From each byte, the seven least significant bits are
    used to form the resulting integer. As long as the most significant bit is
    1, this process continues; the byte with MSB 0 provides the last seven bits.
    The seven-bit chunks are concatenated. Later values are more
  significant.</p>
<p class="Pp">This size encoding should not be confused with the &quot;offset
    encoding&quot;, which is also used in this document.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Deltified_representation"><a class="permalink" href="#Deltified_representation">Deltified
  representation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Conceptually there are only four object types: commit, tree, tag
    and blob. However to save space, an object could be stored as a
    &quot;delta&quot; of another &quot;base&quot; object. These representations
    are assigned new types ofs-delta and ref-delta, which is only valid in a
    pack file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both ofs-delta and ref-delta store the &quot;delta&quot; to be
    applied to another object (called <i>base object</i>) to reconstruct the
    object. The difference between them is, ref-delta directly encodes base
    object name. If the base object is in the same pack, ofs-delta encodes the
    offset of the base object in the pack instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">The base object could also be deltified if it&#x2019;s in the same
    pack. Ref-delta can also refer to an object outside the pack (i.e. the
    so-called &quot;thin pack&quot;). When stored on disk however, the pack
    should be self contained to avoid cyclic dependency.</p>
<p class="Pp">The delta data starts with the size of the base object and the
    size of the object to be reconstructed. These sizes are encoded using the
    size encoding from above. The remainder of the delta data is a sequence of
    instructions to reconstruct the object from the base object. If the base
    object is deltified, it must be converted to canonical form first. Each
    instruction appends more and more data to the target object until
    it&#x2019;s complete. There are two supported instructions so far: one for
    copy a byte range from the source object and one for inserting new data
    embedded in the instruction itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each instruction has variable length. Instruction type is
    determined by the seventh bit of the first octet. The following diagrams
    follow the convention in RFC 1951 (Deflate compressed data format).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Instruction to copy from base object</b>

| 1xxxxxxx | offset1 | offset2 | offset3 | offset4 | size1 | size2 | size3 |
+----------+---------+---------+---------+---------+-------+-------+-------+</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This is the instruction format to copy a byte range from the
    source object. It encodes the offset to copy from and the number of bytes to
    copy. Offset and size are in little-endian order.</p>
<p class="Pp">All offset and size bytes are optional. This is to reduce the
    instruction size when encoding small offsets or sizes. The first seven bits
    in the first octet determines which of the next seven octets is present. If
    bit zero is set, offset1 is present. If bit one is set offset2 is present
    and so on.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that a more compact instruction does not change offset and
    size encoding. For example, if only offset2 is omitted like below, offset3
    still contains bits 16-23. It does not become offset2 and contains bits 8-15
    even if it&#x2019;s right next to offset1.</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>+----------+---------+---------+

</div>
<p class="Pp">In its most compact form, this instruction only takes up one byte
    (0x80) with both offset and size omitted, which will have default values
    zero. There is another exception: size zero is automatically converted to
    0x10000.</p>

<p class="Pp">This is the instruction to construct target object without the

<h1 class="Sh">MULTI-PACK-INDEX REVERSE INDEXES</h1>
<p class="Pp">Similar to the pack-based reverse index, the multi-pack index can
    also be used to generate a reverse index.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of mapping between offset, pack-, and index position, this
    reverse index maps between an object&#x2019;s position within the MIDX, and
    that object&#x2019;s position within a pseudo-pack that the MIDX describes
    (i.e., the ith entry of the multi-pack reverse index holds the MIDX position
    of ith object in pseudo-pack order).</p>
<p class="Pp">To clarify the difference between these orderings, consider a
    multi-pack reachability bitmap (which does not yet exist, but is what we are
    building towards here). Each bit needs to correspond to an object in the
    MIDX, and so we need an efficient mapping from bit position to MIDX
    position.</p>
<p class="Pp">One solution is to let bits occupy the same position in the
    oid-sorted index stored by the MIDX. But because oids are effectively
    random, their resulting reachability bitmaps would have no locality, and
    thus compress poorly. (This is the reason that single-pack bitmaps use the
    pack ordering, and not the .idx ordering, for the same purpose.)</p>
<p class="Pp">So we&#x2019;d like to define an ordering for the whole MIDX based
    around pack ordering, which has far better locality (and thus compresses
    more efficiently). We can think of a pseudo-pack created by the
    concatenation of all of the packs in the MIDX. E.g., if we had a MIDX with
    three packs (a, b, c), with 10, 15, and 20 objects respectively, we can
    imagine an ordering of the objects like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>|a,0|a,1|...|a,9|b,0|b,1|...|b,14|c,0|c,1|...|c,19|</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">where the ordering of the packs is defined by the MIDX&#x2019;s
    pack list, and then the ordering of objects within each pack is the same as
    the order in the actual packfile.</p>
<p class="Pp">Given the list of packs and their counts of objects, you can
    na&#x00EF;vely reconstruct that pseudo-pack ordering (e.g., the object at
    position 27 must be (c,1) because packs &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;
    consumed 25 of the slots). But there&#x2019;s a catch. Objects may be
    duplicated between packs, in which case the MIDX only stores one pointer to
    the object (and thus we&#x2019;d want only one slot in the bitmap).</p>
<p class="Pp">Callers could handle duplicates themselves by reading objects in
    order of their bit-position, but that&#x2019;s linear in the number of
    objects, and much too expensive for ordinary bitmap lookups. Building a
    reverse index solves this, since it is the logical inverse of the index, and
    that index has already removed duplicates. But, building a reverse index on
    the fly can be expensive. Since we already have an on-disk format for
    pack-based reverse indexes, let&#x2019;s reuse it for the MIDX&#x2019;s
    pseudo-pack, too.</p>
<p class="Pp">Objects from the MIDX are ordered as follows to string together
    the pseudo-pack. Let <b>pack(o)</b> return the pack from which <b>o</b> was
    selected by the MIDX, and define an ordering of packs based on their numeric
    ID (as stored by the MIDX). Let <b>offset(o)</b> return the object offset of
    <b>o</b> within <b>pack(o)</b>. Then, compare <b>o1</b> and <b>o2</b> as
    follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If one of <b>pack(o1)</b> and <b>pack(o2)</b> is
  preferred and the other is not, then the preferred one sorts first.
<p class="Pp">(This is a detail that allows the MIDX bitmap to determine which
    pack should be used by the pack-reuse mechanism, since it can ask the MIDX
    for the pack containing the object at bit position 0).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If <b>pack(o1) &#x2260; pack(o2)</b>, then sort
  the two objects in descending order based on the pack ID.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Otherwise, <b>pack(o1) = pack(o2)</b>, and the
  objects are sorted in pack-order (i.e., <b>o1</b> sorts ahead of <b>o2</b>
  exactly when <b>offset(o1) &lt; offset(o2)</b>).</div>
<p class="Pp">In short, a MIDX&#x2019;s pseudo-pack is the de-duplicated
    concatenation of objects in packs stored by the MIDX, laid out in pack
    order, and the packs arranged in MIDX order (with the preferred pack coming
    first).</p>
<p class="Pp">The MIDX&#x2019;s reverse index is stored in the optional
    <i>RIDX</i> chunk within the MIDX itself.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CRUFT_PACKS"><a class="permalink" href="#CRUFT_PACKS">CRUFT
  PACKS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The cruft packs feature offer an alternative to Git&#x2019;s
    traditional mechanism of removing unreachable objects. This document
    provides an overview of Git&#x2019;s pruning mechanism, and how a cruft pack
    can be used instead to accomplish the same.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Background"><a class="permalink" href="#Background">Background</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">To remove unreachable objects from your repository, Git offers
    <b>git repack -Ad</b> (see <b>git-repack</b>(1)). Quoting from the
    documentation:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>[...] unreachable objects in a previous pack become loose, unpacked objects,
instead of being left in the old pack. [...] loose unreachable objects will be
pruned according to normal expiry rules with the next 'git gc' invocation.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Unreachable objects aren&#x2019;t removed immediately, since doing
    so could race with an incoming push which may reference an object which is
    about to be deleted. Instead, those unreachable objects are stored as loose
    objects and stay that way until they are older than the expiration window,
    at which point they are removed by <b>git-prune</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">Git must store these unreachable objects loose in order to keep
    track of their per-object mtimes. If these unreachable objects were written
    into one big pack, then either freshening that pack (because an object
    contained within it was re-written) or creating a new pack of unreachable
    objects would cause the pack&#x2019;s mtime to get updated, and the objects
    within it would never leave the expiration window. Instead, objects are
    stored loose in order to keep track of the individual object mtimes and
    avoid a situation where all cruft objects are freshened at once.</p>
<p class="Pp">This can lead to undesirable situations when a repository contains
    many unreachable objects which have not yet left the grace period. Having
    large directories in the shards of <b>.git/objects</b> can lead to decreased
    performance in the repository. But given enough unreachable objects, this
    can lead to inode starvation and degrade the performance of the whole
    system. Since we can never pack those objects, these repositories often take
    up a large amount of disk space, since we can only zlib compress them, but
    not store them in delta chains.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Cruft_packs"><a class="permalink" href="#Cruft_packs">Cruft
  packs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A cruft pack eliminates the need for storing unreachable objects
    in a loose state by including the per-object mtimes in a separate file
    alongside a single pack containing all loose objects.</p>
<p class="Pp">A cruft pack is written by <b>git repack --cruft</b> when
    generating a new pack. <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1)'s <b>--cruft</b> option.
    Note that <b>git repack --cruft</b> is a classic all-into-one repack,
    meaning that everything in the resulting pack is reachable, and everything
    else is unreachable. Once written, the <b>--cruft</b> option instructs
    <b>git repack</b> to generate another pack containing only objects not
    packed in the previous step (which equates to packing all unreachable
    objects together). This progresses as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.Enumerate every object, marking any object which is
  (a) not contained in a kept-pack, and (b) whose mtime is within the grace
  period as a traversal tip.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Perform a reachability traversal based on the tips
  gathered in the previous step, adding every object along the way to the
  pack.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Write the pack out, along with a <b>.mtimes</b> file
  that records the per-object timestamps.</div>
<p class="Pp">This mode is invoked internally by <b>git-repack</b>(1) when
    instructed to write a cruft pack. Crucially, the set of in-core kept packs
    is exactly the set of packs which will not be deleted by the repack; in
    other words, they contain all of the repository&#x2019;s reachable
  objects.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a repository already has a cruft pack, <b>git repack
    --cruft</b> typically only adds objects to it. An exception to this is when
    <b>git repack</b> is given the <b>--cruft-expiration</b> option, which
    allows the generated cruft pack to omit expired objects instead of waiting
    for <b>git-gc</b>(1) to expire those objects later on.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is <b>git-gc</b>(1) that is typically responsible for removing
    expired unreachable objects.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Caution_for_mixed"><a class="permalink" href="#Caution_for_mixed">Caution
  for mixed-version environments</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Repositories that have cruft packs in them will continue to work
    with any older version of Git. Note, however, that previous versions of Git
    which do not understand the <b>.mtimes</b> file will use the cruft
    pack&#x2019;s mtime as the mtime for all of the objects in it. In other
    words, do not expect older (pre-cruft pack) versions of Git to interpret or
    even read the contents of the <b>.mtimes</b> file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that having mixed versions of Git GC-ing the same repository
    can lead to unreachable objects never being completely pruned. This can
    happen under the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;An older version of Git running GC explodes the
  contents of an existing cruft pack loose, using the cruft pack&#x2019;s
  mtime.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;A newer version running GC collects those loose
  objects into a cruft pack, where the .mtime file reflects the loose
  object&#x2019;s actual mtimes, but the cruft pack mtime is
  &quot;now&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">Repeating this process will lead to unreachable objects not
    getting pruned as a result of repeatedly resetting the objects' mtimes to
    the present time.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are GC-ing repositories in a mixed version environment,
    consider omitting the <b>--cruft</b> option when using <b>git-repack</b>(1)
    and <b>git-gc</b>(1), and leaving the <b>gc.cruftPacks</b> configuration
    unset until all writers understand cruft packs.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Alternatives"><a class="permalink" href="#Alternatives">Alternatives</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Notable alternatives to this design include:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The location of the per-object mtime data,
  and</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Storing unreachable objects in multiple cruft
  packs.</div>
<p class="Pp">On the location of mtime data, a new auxiliary file tied to the
    pack was chosen to avoid complicating the <b>.idx</b> format. If the
    <b>.idx</b> format were ever to gain support for optional chunks of data, it
    may make sense to consolidate the <b>.mtimes</b> format into the <b>.idx</b>
    itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">Storing unreachable objects among multiple cruft packs (e.g.,
    creating a new cruft pack during each repacking operation including only
    unreachable objects which aren&#x2019;t already stored in an earlier cruft
    pack) is significantly more complicated to construct, and so aren&#x2019;t
    pursued here. The obvious drawback to the current implementation is that the
    entire cruft pack must be re-written from scratch.</p>
