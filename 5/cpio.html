<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">cpio</code> archive format collects any
    number of files, directories, and other file system objects (symbolic links,
    device nodes, etc.) into a single stream of bytes.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="General_Format"><a class="permalink" href="#General_Format">General
  Format</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Each file system object in a <code class="Nm">cpio</code> archive
    comprises a header record with basic numeric metadata followed by the full
    pathname of the entry and the file data. The header record stores a series
    of integer values that generally follow the fields in <var class="Va">struct
    stat</var>. (See <a class="Xr" href="../2/stat">stat(2)</a> for details.)
    The variants differ primarily in how they store those integers (binary,
    octal, or hexadecimal). The header is followed by the pathname of the entry
    (the length of the pathname is stored in the header) and any file data. The
    end of the archive is indicated by a special record with the pathname
    &#x201C;TRAILER!!!&#x201D;.</p>

  Binary Format</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The old binary <code class="Nm">cpio</code> format stores numbers
    as 2-byte and 4-byte binary values. Each entry begins with a header in the
    following format:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
struct header_old_cpio {
        unsigned short   c_magic;
        unsigned short   c_dev;
        unsigned short   c_ino;
        unsigned short   c_mode;
        unsigned short   c_uid;
        unsigned short   c_gid;
        unsigned short   c_nlink;
        unsigned short   c_rdev;
	unsigned short   c_mtime[2];
        unsigned short   c_namesize;
	unsigned short   c_filesize[2];
};
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Va">unsigned short</var> fields here are 16-bit
    integer values; the <var class="Va">unsigned int</var> fields are 32-bit
    integer values. The fields are as follows</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><var class="Va">magic</var></dt>
  <dd>The integer value octal 070707. This value can be used to determine
      whether this archive is written with little-endian or big-endian
    integers.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Va">dev</var>, <var class="Va">ino</var></dt>
  <dd>The device and inode numbers from the disk. These are used by programs
      that read <code class="Nm">cpio</code> archives to determine when two
      entries refer to the same file. Programs that synthesize
      <code class="Nm">cpio</code> archives should be careful to set these to
      distinct values for each entry.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Va">mode</var></dt>
  <dd>The mode specifies both the regular permissions and the file type. It
      consists of several bit fields as follows:
    <dl class="Bl-tag Bl-compact">
      <dt>0170000</dt>
      <dd>This masks the file type bits.</dd>
      <dt>0140000</dt>
      <dd>File type value for sockets.</dd>
      <dt>0120000</dt>
      <dd>File type value for symbolic links. For symbolic links, the link body
          is stored as file data.</dd>
      <dt>0100000</dt>
      <dd>File type value for regular files.</dd>
      <dt>0060000</dt>
      <dd>File type value for block special devices.</dd>
      <dt>0040000</dt>
      <dd>File type value for directories.</dd>
      <dt>0020000</dt>
      <dd>File type value for character special devices.</dd>
      <dt>0010000</dt>
      <dd>File type value for named pipes or FIFOs.</dd>
      <dt>0004000</dt>
      <dd>SUID bit.</dd>
      <dt>0002000</dt>
      <dd>SGID bit.</dd>
      <dt>0001000</dt>
      <dd>Sticky bit. On some systems, this modifies the behavior of executables
          and/or directories.</dd>
      <dt>0000777</dt>
      <dd>The lower 9 bits specify read/write/execute permissions for world,
          group, and user following standard POSIX conventions.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt><var class="Va">uid</var>, <var class="Va">gid</var></dt>
  <dd>The numeric user id and group id of the owner.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Va">nlink</var></dt>
  <dd>The number of links to this file. Directories always have a value of at
      least two here. Note that hardlinked files include file data with every
      copy in the archive.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Va">rdev</var></dt>
  <dd>For block special and character special entries, this field contains the
      associated device number. For all other entry types, it should be set to
      zero by writers and ignored by readers.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Va">mtime</var></dt>
  <dd>Modification time of the file, indicated as the number of seconds since
      the start of the epoch, 00:00:00 UTC January 1, 1970. The four-byte
      integer is stored with the most-significant 16 bits first followed by the
      least-significant 16 bits. Each of the two 16 bit values are stored in
      machine-native byte order.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Va">namesize</var></dt>
  <dd>The number of bytes in the pathname that follows the header. This count
      includes the trailing NUL byte.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Va">filesize</var></dt>
  <dd>The size of the file. Note that this archive format is limited to four
      gigabyte file sizes. See <var class="Va">mtime</var> above for a
      description of the storage of four-byte integers.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The pathname immediately follows the fixed header. If the
    <code class="Cm">namesize</code> is odd, an additional NUL byte is added
    after the pathname. The file data is then appended, padded with NUL bytes to
    an even length.</p>
<p class="Pp">Hardlinked files are not given special treatment; the full file
    contents are included with each copy of the file.</p>

<p class="Pp"><span class="St">Version&#x00A0;2 of the Single UNIX Specification
    (&#x201C;SUSv2&#x201D;)</span> standardized an ASCII variant that is
    portable across all platforms. It is commonly known as the &#x201C;old
    character&#x201D; format or as the &#x201C;odc&#x201D; format. It stores the
    same numeric fields as the old binary format, but represents them as
    6-character or 11-character octal values.</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
struct cpio_odc_header {
        char    c_magic[6];

</div>
<p class="Pp">The fields are identical to those in the old binary format. The
    name and file body follow the fixed header. Unlike the old binary format,
    there is no additional padding after the pathname or file contents. If the

    archive will be entirely ASCII, except for the NUL byte that terminates the
    name field.</p>

  <dd>This field is always set to zero by writers and ignored by readers. See

</dl>
<p class="Pp">The pathname is followed by NUL bytes so that the total size of
    the fixed header plus pathname is a multiple of four. Likewise, the file
    data is padded to a multiple of four bytes. Note that this format supports
    only 4 gigabyte files (unlike the older ASCII format, which supports 8
    gigabyte files).</p>

    filesize to zero for each entry except the first one that appears in the

<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">cpio</code> utility is no longer a part of

    <span class="St">Version&#x00A0;2 of the Single UNIX Specification

<p class="Pp">The original cpio utility was written by Dick Haight while working
    in AT&amp;T's Unix Support Group. It appeared in 1977 as part of PWB/UNIX
    1.0, the &#x201C;Programmer's Work Bench&#x201D; derived from
    <span class="Ux">Version&#x00A0;6 AT&amp;T UNIX</span> that was used
    internally at AT&amp;T. Both the old binary and old character formats were
    in use by 1980, according to the System III source released by SCO under
    their &#x201C;Ancient Unix&#x201D; license. The character format was adopted
    as part of <span class="St">IEEE Std 1003.1-1988

<p class="Pp">The &#x201C;CRC&#x201D; format is mis-named, as it uses a simple
    checksum and not a cyclic redundancy check.</p>
<p class="Pp">The old binary format is limited to 16 bits for user id, group id,
    device, and inode numbers. It is limited to 4 gigabyte file sizes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The old ASCII format is limited to 18 bits for the user id, group
    id, device, and inode numbers. It is limited to 8 gigabyte file sizes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The new ASCII format is limited to 4 gigabyte file sizes.</p>
<p class="Pp">None of the cpio formats store user or group names, which are
    essential when moving files between systems with dissimilar user or group
    numbering.</p>
<p class="Pp">Especially when writing older cpio variants, it may be necessary
    to map actual device/inode values to synthesized values that fit the
    available fields. With very large filesystems, this may be necessary even
    for the newer formats.</p>
