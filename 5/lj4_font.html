<p class="Pp">Nominally, all Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4&#x2013;series and newer
    printers have the same internal fonts: 45 scalable fonts and one bitmapped
    Lineprinter font. The scalable fonts are available in sizes between 0.25
    point and 999.75 points, in 0.25-point increments; the Lineprinter font is
    available only in 8.5-point size.</p>
<p class="Pp">The LaserJet font files included with <b>groff</b> assume that all
    printers since the LaserJet 4 are identical. There are some differences
    between fonts in the earlier and more recent printers, however. The LaserJet
    4 printer used Agfa Intellifont technology for 35 of the internal scalable
    fonts; the remaining 10 scalable fonts were TrueType. Beginning with the
    LaserJet 4000&#x2013;series printers introduced in 1997, all scalable
    internal fonts have been TrueType. The number of printable glyphs differs
    slightly between Intellifont and TrueType fonts (generally, the TrueType
    fonts include more glyphs), and there are some minor differences in glyph
    metrics. Differences among printer models are described in the <i>PCL 5
    Comparison Guide</i> and the <i>PCL 5 Comparison Guide Addendum</i> (for
    printers introduced since approximately 2001).</p>
<p class="Pp">LaserJet printers reference a glyph by a combination of a
    256-glyph symbol set and an index within that symbol set. Many glyphs appear
    in more than one symbol set; all combinations of symbol set and index that
    reference the same glyph are equivalent. For each glyph, <b>hpftodit</b>(1)
    searches a list of symbol sets, and selects the first set that contains the
    glyph. The printing code generated by <b>hpftodit</b>(1) is an integer that
    encodes a numerical value for the symbol set in the high byte(s), and the
    index in the low byte. See <b>groff_font</b>(5) for a complete description
    of the font file format; symbol sets are described in greater detail in the
    <i>PCL 5 Printer Language Technical Reference Manual</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Two of the scalable fonts, Symbol and Wingdings, are bound to
    256-glyph symbol sets; the remaining scalable fonts, as well as the
    Lineprinter font, support numerous symbol sets, sufficient to enable
    printing of more than 600 glyphs.</p>
<p class="Pp">The metrics generated by <b>hpftodit</b>(1) assume that the DESC
    file contains values of 1200 for res and 6350 for unitwidth (or any
    combination (e.g., 2400 and 3175) for which res &#x00D7; unitwidth =
    7620000). Although HP PCL 5 LaserJet printers support an internal resolution
    of 7200 units per inch, they use a 16-bit signed integer for cursor
    positioning; if <b>devlj4</b> is to support U.S. ledger paper (11&#x2033;
    &#x00D7; 17&#x2033;), the maximum usable resolution is 32767 / 17, or 1927,
    units per inch, which rounds down to 1200 units per inch. If the largest
    required paper size is less (e.g., 8.5&#x2033; &#x00D7; 11&#x2033; or A5), a
    greater resolution (and lesser unitwidth) can be specified.</p>

<p class="Pp">Font metrics for Intellifont fonts were provided by Tagged Font
    Metric (TFM) files originally developed by Agfa/Compugraphic. The TFM files
    provided for these fonts supported 600+ glyphs and contained extensive lists
    of kern pairs.</p>
<p class="Pp">To accommodate developers who had become accustomed to TFM files,
    HP also provided TFM files for the 10 TrueType fonts included in the
    LaserJet 4. The TFM files for TrueType fonts generally included less
    information than the Intellifont TFMs, supporting fewer glyphs, and in most
    cases, providing no kerning information. By the time the LaserJet 4000
    printer was introduced, most developers had migrated to other means of
    obtaining font metrics, and support for new TFM files was very limited. The
    TFM files provided for the TrueType fonts in the LaserJet 4000 support only
    the Latin 2 (ISO 8859-2) symbol set, and include no kerning information;
    consequently, they are of little value for any but the most rudimentary
    documents.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because the Intellifont TFM files contain considerably more
    information, they generally are preferable to the TrueType TFM files even
    for use with the TrueType fonts in the newer printers. The metrics for the
    TrueType fonts are very close, though not identical, to those for the
    earlier Intellifont fonts of the same names. Although most output using the
    Intellifont metrics with the newer printers is quite acceptable, a few
    glyphs may fail to print as expected. The differences in glyph metrics may
    be particularly noticeable with composite parentheses, brackets, and braces
    used by <b>eqn</b>(1)<b>.</b> A script, located in
    <b>/usr/share/groff/1.19.2/font/devlj4/generate</b>, can be used to adjust
    the metrics for these glyphs in the special font S for use with printers
    that have all TrueType fonts.</p>
<p class="Pp">At the time HP last supported TFM files, only Version 1 of the
    Unicode standard was available. Consequently, many glyphs lacking assigned
    code points were assigned by HP to the Private Use Area (PUA). Later
    versions of the Unicode standard included code points outside the PUA for
    many of these glyphs. The HP-supplied TrueType TFM files use the PUA
    assignments; TFM files generated from more recent TrueType font files
    require the later Unicode values to access the same glyphs. Consequently,
    two different mapping files may be required: one for the HP-supplied TFM
    files, and one for more recent TFM files.</p>
