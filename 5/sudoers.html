<p class="Pp">The <b>sudoers</b> policy plugin determines a user's <b>sudo</b>
    privileges. It is the default <b>sudo</b> policy plugin. The policy is
    driven by the <i>/private/etc/sudoers</i> file or, optionally, in LDAP. The
    policy format is described in detail in the <i>SUDOERS FILE FORMAT</i>
    section. For information on storing <b>sudoers</b> policy information in
    LDAP, see sudoers.ldap(5).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Configuring_sudo.conf_for_sudoers"><a class="permalink" href="#Configuring_sudo.conf_for_sudoers">Configuring
  sudo.conf for sudoers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>sudo</b> consults the sudo.conf(5) file to determine which
    plugins to load. If no sudo.conf(5) file is present, or if it contains no
    <i>Plugin</i> lines, <b>sudoers</b> will be used for auditing, policy
    decisions and I/O logging. To explicitly configure sudo.conf(5) to use the
    <b>sudoers</b> plugin, the following configuration can be used.</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Plugin sudoers_audit sudoers.so
Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so
Plugin sudoers_io sudoers.so</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Starting with <b>sudo</b> 1.8.5, it is possible to specify
    optional arguments to the <b>sudoers</b> plugin in the sudo.conf(5) file.
    Plugin arguments, if any, should be listed after the path to the plugin
    (i.e., after <i>sudoers.so</i>). The arguments are only effective for the
    plugin that opens (and parses) the <i>sudoers</i> file.</p>
<p class="Pp">For <b>sudo</b> version 1.9.1 and higher, this is the
    <i>sudoers_audit</i> plugin. For older versions, it is the
    <i>sudoers_policy</i> plugin. Multiple arguments may be specified, separated
    by white space. For example:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Plugin sudoers_audit sudoers.so sudoers_mode=0400 error_recovery=false</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">The following plugin arguments are supported:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="error_recovery=bool"><a class="permalink" href="#error_recovery=bool">error_recovery=bool</a></dt>
  <dd>The <i>error_recovery</i> argument can be used to control whether
      <b>sudoers</b> should attempt to recover from syntax errors in the
      <i>sudoers</i> file. If set to <i>true</i> (the default), <b>sudoers</b>
      will try to recover from a syntax error by discarding the portion of the
      line that contains the error until the end of the line. A value of
      <i>false</i> will disable error recovery. Prior to version 1.9.3, no error
      recovery was performed.</dd>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="User_Authentication"><a class="permalink" href="#User_Authentication">User
  Authentication</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>sudoers</b> security policy requires that most users
    authenticate themselves before they can use <b>sudo</b>. A password is not
    required if the invoking user is <b>root</b>, if the target user is the same
    as the invoking user, or if the policy has disabled authentication for the
    user or command. Unlike su(1), when <b>sudoers</b> requires authentication,
    it validates the invoking user's credentials, not the target user's (or
    <b>root</b>'s) credentials. This can be changed via the <i>rootpw</i>,
    <i>targetpw</i> and <i>runaspw</i> flags, described later.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a user who is not listed in the policy tries to run a command
    via <b>sudo</b>, mail is sent to the proper authorities. The address used
    for such mail is configurable via the <i>mailto</i> Defaults entry
    (described later) and defaults to <i>root</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">No mail will be sent if an unauthorized user tries to run
    <b>sudo</b> with the <b>-l</b> or <b>-v</b> option unless there is an
    authentication error and either the <i>mail_always</i> or
    <i>mail_badpass</i> flags are enabled. This allows users to determine for
    themselves whether or not they are allowed to use <b>sudo</b>. By default,
    all attempts to run <b>sudo</b> (successful or not) are logged, regardless
    of whether or not mail is sent.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>sudo</b> is run by <b>root</b> and the SUDO_USER environment
    variable is set, the <b>sudoers</b> policy will use this value to determine
    who the actual user is. This can be used by a user to log commands through
    sudo even when a <b>root</b> shell has been invoked. It also allows the
    <b>-e</b> option to remain useful even when invoked via a sudo-run script or
    program. Note, however, that the <i>sudoers</i> file lookup is still done
    for <b>root</b>, not the user specified by SUDO_USER.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>sudoers</b> uses per-user time stamp files for credential
    caching. Once a user has been authenticated, a record is written containing
    the user-ID that was used to authenticate, the terminal session ID, the
    start time of the session leader (or parent process) and a time stamp (using
    a monotonic clock if one is available). The user may then use <b>sudo</b>
    without a password for a short period of time (5 minutes unless overridden
    by the <i>timestamp_timeout</i> option). By default, <b>sudoers</b> uses a
    separate record for each terminal, which means that a user's login sessions
    are authenticated separately. The <i>timestamp_type</i> option can be used
    to select the type of time stamp record <b>sudoers</b> will use.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Logging"><a class="permalink" href="#Logging">Logging</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">By default, <b>sudoers</b> logs both successful and unsuccessful
    attempts (as well as errors). The <i>log_allowed</i> and <i>log_denied</i>
    flags can be used to control this behavior. Messages can be logged to
    syslog(3), a log file, or both. The default is to log to syslog(3) but this
    is configurable via the <i>syslog</i> and <i>logfile</i> settings. See
    <i>EVENT LOGGING</i> for a description of the log file format.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>sudoers</b> is also capable of running a command in a
    pseudo-terminal and logging input and/or output. The standard input,
    standard output, and standard error can be logged even when not associated
    with a terminal. For more information about I/O logging, see the <i>I/O
    LOGGING</i> section.</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with version 1.9, the <i>log_servers</i> setting may be
    used to send event and I/O log data to a remote server running
    <b>sudo_logsrvd</b> or another service that implements the protocol
    described by sudo_logsrv.proto(5).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Command_environment"><a class="permalink" href="#Command_environment">Command
  environment</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Since environment variables can influence program behavior,
    <b>sudoers</b> provides a means to restrict which variables from the user's
    environment are inherited by the command to be run. There are two distinct
    ways <b>sudoers</b> can deal with environment variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, the <i>env_reset</i> flag is enabled. This causes
    commands to be executed with a new, minimal environment. On AIX (and Linux
    systems without PAM), the environment is initialized with the contents of
    the <i>/etc/environment</i> file. The HOME, MAIL, SHELL, LOGNAME and USER
    environment variables are initialized based on the target user and the
    SUDO_* variables are set based on the invoking user. Additional variables,
    such as DISPLAY, PATH and TERM, are preserved from the invoking user's
    environment if permitted by the <i>env_check</i>, or <i>env_keep</i>
    options. A few environment variables are treated specially. If the PATH and
    TERM variables are not preserved from the user's environment, they will be
    set to default values. The LOGNAME and USER are handled as a single entity.
    If one of them is preserved (or removed) from the user's environment, the
    other will be as well. If LOGNAME and USER are to be preserved but only one
    of them is present in the user's environment, the other will be set to the
    same value. This avoids an inconsistent environment where one of the
    variables describing the user name is set to the invoking user and one is
    set to the target user. Environment variables with a value beginning with
    &#x2018;()&#x2019; are removed unless both the name and value parts are
    matched by <i>env_keep</i> or <i>env_check</i>, as they may be interpreted
    as functions by the <b>bash</b> shell. Prior to version 1.8.11, such
    variables were always removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If, however, the <i>env_reset</i> flag is disabled, any variables
    not explicitly denied by the <i>env_check</i> and <i>env_delete</i> options
    are allowed and their values are inherited from the invoking process. Prior
    to version 1.8.21, environment variables with a value beginning with
    &#x2018;()&#x2019; were always removed. Beginning with version 1.8.21, a
    pattern in <i>env_delete</i> is used to match <b>bash</b> shell functions
    instead. Since it is not possible to block all potentially dangerous
    environment variables, use of the default <i>env_reset</i> behavior is
    encouraged.</p>
<p class="Pp">Environment variables specified by <i>env_check</i>,
    <i>env_delete</i>, or <i>env_keep</i> may include one or more
    &#x2018;*&#x2019; characters which will match zero or more characters. No
    other wildcard characters are supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, environment variables are matched by name. However, if
    the pattern includes an equal sign (&#x2018;=&#x2019;), both the variables
    name and value must match. For example, a <b>bash</b> shell function could
    be matched as follows:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>env_keep += &quot;BASH_FUNC_my_func%%=()*&quot;</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Without the &#x2018;=()*&#x2019; suffix, this would not match, as
    <b>bash</b> shell functions are not preserved by default.</p>
<p class="Pp">The complete list of environment variables that are preserved or
    removed, as modified by global Defaults parameters in <i>sudoers</i>, is
    displayed when <b>sudo</b> is run by <b>root</b> with the <b>-V</b> option.
    The list of environment variables to remove varies based on the operating
    system <b>sudo</b> is running on.</p>
<p class="Pp">Other <b>sudoers</b> options may influence the command
    environment, such as <i>always_set_home</i>, <i>secure_path</i>,
    <i>set_logname</i>, and <i>set_home</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems that support PAM where the <b>pam_env</b> module is
    enabled for <b>sudo</b>, variables in the PAM environment may be merged in
    to the environment. If a variable in the PAM environment is already present
    in the user's environment, the value will only be overridden if the variable
    was not preserved by <b>sudoers</b>. When <i>env_reset</i> is enabled,
    variables preserved from the invoking user's environment by the
    <i>env_keep</i> list take precedence over those in the PAM environment. When
    <i>env_reset</i> is disabled, variables present the invoking user's
    environment take precedence over those in the PAM environment unless they
    match a pattern in the <i>env_delete</i> list.</p>
<p class="Pp">The dynamic linker on most operating systems will remove variables
    that can control dynamic linking from the environment of set-user-ID
    executables, including <b>sudo</b>. Depending on the operating system this
    may include _RLD*, DYLD_*, LD_*, LDR_*, LIBPATH, SHLIB_PATH, and others.
    These type of variables are removed from the environment before <b>sudo</b>
    even begins execution and, as such, it is not possible for <b>sudo</b> to
    preserve them.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a special case, if the <b>-i</b> option (initial login) is
    specified, <b>sudoers</b> will initialize the environment regardless of the
    value of <i>env_reset</i>. The DISPLAY, PATH and TERM variables remain
    unchanged; HOME, MAIL, SHELL, USER, and LOGNAME are set based on the target
    user. On AIX (and Linux systems without PAM), the contents of
    <i>/etc/environment</i> are also included. All other environment variables
    are removed unless permitted by <i>env_keep</i> or <i>env_check</i>,
    described above.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, the <i>restricted_env_file</i> and <i>env_file</i> files
    are applied, if present. The variables in <i>restricted_env_file</i> are
    applied first and are subject to the same restrictions as the invoking
    user's environment, as detailed above. The variables in <i>env_file</i> are
    applied last and are not subject to these restrictions. In both cases,
    variables present in the files will only be set to their specified values if
    they would not conflict with an existing environment variable.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SUDOERS_FILE_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#SUDOERS_FILE_FORMAT">SUDOERS
  FILE FORMAT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>sudoers</i> file is composed of two types of entries:
    aliases (basically variables) and user specifications (which specify who may
    run what).</p>
<p class="Pp">When multiple entries match for a user, they are applied in order.
    Where there are multiple matches, the last match is used (which is not
    necessarily the most specific match).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>sudoers</i> file grammar will be described below in
    Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF). Don't despair if you are unfamiliar with
    EBNF; it is fairly simple, and the definitions below are annotated.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Resource_limits"><a class="permalink" href="#Resource_limits">Resource
  limits</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">By default, <b>sudoers</b> uses the operating system's native
    method of setting resource limits for the target user. On Linux systems,
    resource limits are usually set by the <i>pam_limits.so</i> PAM module. On
    some BSD systems, the <i>/etc/login.conf</i> file specifies resource limits
    for the user. On AIX systems, resource limits are configured in the
    <i>/etc/security/limits</i> file. If there is no system mechanism to set
    per-user resource limits, the command will run with the same limits as the
    invoking user. The one exception to this is the core dump file size, which
    is set by <b>sudoers</b> to 0 by default. Disabling core dumps by default
    makes it possible to avoid potential security problems where the core file
    is treated as trusted input.</p>
<p class="Pp">Resource limits may also be set in the <i>sudoers</i> file itself,
    in which case they override those set by the system. See the
    <i>rlimit_as,</i> <i>rlimit_core,</i> <i>rlimit_cpu,</i> <i>rlimit_data,</i>
    <i>rlimit_fsize,</i> <i>rlimit_locks,</i> <i>rlimit_memlock,</i>
    <i>rlimit_nofile,</i> <i>rlimit_nproc,</i> <i>rlimit_rss,</i>
    <i>rlimit_stack</i> options described below. Resource limits in
    <b>sudoers</b> may be specified in one of the following formats:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x201C;value&#x201D;</dt>
  <dd>Both the soft and hard resource limits are set to the same value. The
      special value &#x201C;infinity&#x201D; can be used to indicate that the
      value is unlimited.</dd>
  <dt>&#x201C;soft,hard&#x201D;</dt>
  <dd>Two comma-separated values. The soft limit is set to the first value and
      the hard limit is set to the second. Both values must either be enclosed
      in a set of double quotes, or the comma must be escaped with a backslash
      (&#x2018;\&#x2019;). The special value &#x201C;infinity&#x201D; may be
      used in place of either value.</dd>
  <dt>&#x201C;default&#x201D;</dt>
  <dd>The default resource limit for the user will be used. This may be a
      user-specific value (see above) or the value of the resource limit when
      <b>sudo</b> was invoked for systems that don't support per-user
    limits.</dd>
  <dt>&#x201C;user&#x201D;</dt>
  <dd>The invoking user's resource limits will be preserved when running the
      command.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">For example, to restore the historic core dump file size behavior,
    a line like the following may be used.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Defaults rlimit_core=default</div>
<p class="Pp">Resource limits in <b>sudoers</b> are only supported by version
    1.8.7 or higher.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Quick_guide_to_EBNF"><a class="permalink" href="#Quick_guide_to_EBNF">Quick
  guide to EBNF</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">EBNF is a concise and exact way of describing the grammar of a
    language. Each EBNF definition is made up of <i>production rules</i>. For
    example:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>symbol ::= definition | alternate1 | alternate2 ...</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Each <i>production rule</i> references others and thus makes up a
    grammar for the language. EBNF also contains the following operators, which
    many readers will recognize from regular expressions. Do not, however,
    confuse them with &#x201C;wildcard&#x201D; characters, which have different
    meanings.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>?</dt>
  <dd>Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols) is optional. That
      is, it may appear once or not at all.</dd>
  <dt>*</dt>
  <dd>Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols) may appear zero or
      more times.</dd>
  <dt>+</dt>
  <dd>Means that the preceding symbol (or group of symbols) may appear one or
      more times.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Parentheses may be used to group symbols together. For clarity, we
    will use single quotes ('') to designate what is a verbatim character string
    (as opposed to a symbol name).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Aliases"><a class="permalink" href="#Aliases">Aliases</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There are four kinds of aliases: <i>User_Alias</i>,

    <i>netgroup</i>, <i>nonunix_group</i> or <i>nonunix_gid</i> may be enclosed
    in double quotes to avoid the need for escaping special characters.
    Alternately, special characters may be specified in escaped hex mode, e.g.,
    \x20 for space. When using double quotes, any prefix characters must be
    included inside the quotes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The actual <i>nonunix_group</i> and <i>nonunix_gid</i> syntax
    depends on the underlying group provider plugin. For instance, the QAS AD
    plugin supports the following formats:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>&#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>Group in the same domain: &quot;%:Group Name&quot;</dd>
  <dt><b>&#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>Group in any domain: &quot;%:Group Name@FULLY.QUALIFIED.DOMAIN&quot;</dd>
  <dt><b>&#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>Group SID:
    &quot;%:S-1-2-34-5678901234-5678901234-5678901234-567&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">See <i>GROUP PROVIDER PLUGINS</i> for more information.</p>
<p class="Pp">Quotes around group names are optional. Unquoted strings must use
    a backslash (&#x2018;\&#x2019;) to escape spaces and special characters. See
    <i>Other special characters and reserved words</i> for a list of characters
    that need to be escaped.</p>

    &#x2018;!&#x2019; operator. Host netgroups are matched using the host (both
    qualified and unqualified) and domain members only; the user member is not
    used when matching. If you specify a network number without a netmask,
    <b>sudo</b> will query each of the local host's network interfaces and, if
    the network number corresponds to one of the hosts's network interfaces,
    will use the netmask of that interface. The netmask may be specified either
    in standard IP address notation (e.g., 255.255.255.0 or
    ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff::), or CIDR notation (number of bits, e.g., 24 or 64). A
    host name may include shell-style wildcards (see the <i>Wildcards</i>
    section below), but unless the <i>hostname</i> command on your machine
    returns the fully qualified host name, you'll need to use the <i>fqdn</i>
    flag for wildcards to be useful. <b>sudo</b> only inspects actual network
    interfaces; this means that IP address 127.0.0.1 (localhost) will never
    match. Also, the host name &#x201C;localhost&#x201D; will only match if that
    is the actual host name, which is usually only the case for non-networked

</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">A <i>Cmnd_List</i> is a list of one or more commands, directories,
    or aliases. A command is a fully qualified file name, which may include
    shell-style wildcards (see the <i>Wildcards</i> section below), or a regular
    expression that starts with &#x2018;^&#x2019; and ends with
    &#x2018;$&#x2019; (see the <i>Regular expressions</i> section below). A
    directory is a fully qualified path name ending in a &#x2018;/&#x2019;. When
    you specify a directory in a <i>Cmnd_List</i>, the user will be able to run
    any file within that directory (but not in any sub-directories therein). If
    no command line arguments are specified, the user may run the command with
    any arguments they choose. Command line arguments can include wildcards or
    be a regular expression that starts with &#x2018;^&#x2019; and ends with
    &#x2018;$&#x2019;. If the command line arguments consist of
    &#x2018;&quot;&quot;&#x2019;, the command may only be run with <i>no</i>
    arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a <i>Cmnd</i> has associated command line arguments, the
    arguments in the <i>Cmnd</i> must match those given by the user on the
    command line. If the arguments in a <i>Cmnd</i> begin with the
    &#x2018;^&#x2019; character, they will be interpreted as a regular
    expression and matched accordingly. Otherwise, shell-style wildcards are
    used when matching. Unless a regular expression is specified, the following
    characters must be escaped with a &#x2018;\&#x2019; if they are used in
    command arguments: &#x2018;,&#x2019;, &#x2018;:&#x2019;, &#x2018;=&#x2019;,
    &#x2018;\&#x2019;. To prevent arguments in a <i>Cmnd</i> that begin with a
    &#x2018;^&#x2019; character from being interpreted as a regular expression,
    the &#x2018;^&#x2019; must be escaped with a &#x2018;\&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are two commands built into <b>sudo</b> itself:
    &#x201C;list&#x201D; and &#x201C;sudoedit&#x201D;. Unlike other commands,
    these two must be specified in the <i>sudoers</i> file <i>without</i> a
    leading path.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &#x201C;list&#x201D; built-in can be used to permit a user to
    list another user's privileges with <b>sudo</b>'s <b>-U</b> option. For
    example, &#x201C;sudo -l -U otheruser&#x201D;. A user with the
    &#x201C;list&#x201D; privilege is able to list another user's privileges
    even if they don't have permission to run commands as that user. By default,
    only root or a user with the ability to run any command as either root or
    the specified <i>user</i> on the current host may use the <b>-U</b> option.
    No command line arguments may be specified with the &#x201C;list&#x201D;
    built-in.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &#x201C;sudoedit&#x201D; built-in is used to permit a user to
    run <b>sudo</b> with the <b>-e</b> option (or as <b>sudoedit</b>). It may
    take command line arguments just as a normal command does. Unlike other
    commands, &#x201C;sudoedit&#x201D; is built into <b>sudo</b> itself and must
    be specified in the <i>sudoers</i> file <i>without</i> a leading path. If a
    leading path is present, for example <i>/usr/bin/sudoedit</i>, the path name
    will be silently converted to &#x201C;sudoedit&#x201D;. A fully-qualified
    path for <b>sudoedit</b> is treated as an error by <b>visudo</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i>command</i> may be preceded by a <i>Digest_List</i>, a
    comma-separated list of one or more <i>Digest_Spec</i> entries. If a
    <i>Digest_List</i> is present, the command will only match successfully if
    it can be verified using one of the SHA-2 digests in the list. Starting with
    version 1.9.0, the <b>ALL</b> reserved word can be used in conjunction with
    a <i>Digest_List</i>. The following digest formats are supported: sha224,
    sha256, sha384, and sha512. The string may be specified in either hex or
    base64 format (base64 is more compact). There are several utilities capable
    of generating SHA-2 digests in hex format such as openssl, shasum,
    sha224sum, sha256sum, sha384sum, sha512sum.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, using openssl:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ openssl dgst -sha224 /bin/ls
SHA224(/bin/ls)= 118187da8364d490b4a7debbf483004e8f3e053ec954309de2c41a25</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">It is also possible to use openssl to generate base64 output:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ openssl dgst -binary -sha224 /bin/ls | openssl base64
EYGH2oNk1JC0p9679IMATo8+BT7JVDCd4sQaJQ==</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Warning, if the user has write access to the command itself
    (directly or via a <b>sudo</b> command), it may be possible for the user to
    replace the command after the digest check has been performed but before the
    command is executed. A similar race condition exists on systems that lack
    the fexecve(2) system call when the directory in which the command is
    located is writable by the user. See the description of the <i>fdexec</i>
    setting for more information on how <b>sudo</b> executes commands that have
    an associated digest.</p>
<p class="Pp">Command digests are only supported by version 1.8.7 or higher.</p>

<p class="Pp">A <b>user specification</b> determines which commands a user may

    <b>root</b> (unless <i>runas_default</i> has been set to a different value)
    but this can also be changed on a per-command basis.</p>
<p class="Pp">The basic structure of a user specification is &#x201C;who where =
    (as_whom) what&#x201D;. Let's break that down into its constituent
  parts:</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Runas_Spec"><a class="permalink" href="#Runas_Spec">Runas_Spec</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A <i>Runas_Spec</i> determines the user and/or the group that a
    command may be run as. A fully-specified <i>Runas_Spec</i> consists of two
    <i>Runas_List</i>s (as defined above) separated by a colon
    (&#x2018;:&#x2019;) and enclosed in a set of parentheses. The first
    <i>Runas_List</i> indicates which users the command may be run as via the
    <b>-u</b> option. The second defines a list of groups that may be specified
    via the <b>-g</b> option (in addition to any of the target user's groups).
    If both <i>Runas_List</i>s are specified, the command may be run with any
    combination of users and groups listed in their respective
    <i>Runas_List</i>s. If only the first is specified, the command may be run
    as any user in the list and, optionally, with any group the target user
    belongs to. If the first <i>Runas_List</i> is empty but the second is
    specified, the command may be run as the invoking user with the group set to
    any listed in the <i>Runas_List</i>. If both <i>Runas_List</i>s are empty,
    the command may only be run as the invoking user and the group, if
    specified, must be one that the invoking user is a member of. If no
    <i>Runas_Spec</i> is specified, the command may only be run as the
    <i>runas_default</i> user (<b>root</b> by default) and the group, if
    specified, must be one that the <i>runas_default</i> user is a member
  of.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <i>Runas_Spec</i> sets the default for the commands that follow
    it. What this means is that for the entry:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>dgb	boulder = (operator) /bin/ls, /bin/kill, /usr/bin/lprm</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">The user <b>dgb</b> may run <i>/bin/ls</i>, <i>/bin/kill</i>, and
    <i>/usr/bin/lprm</i> on the host boulder&#x2014;but only as <b>operator</b>.
    For example:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ sudo -u operator /bin/ls</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">It is also possible to override a <i>Runas_Spec</i> later on in an
    entry. If we modify the entry like so:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>dgb	boulder = (operator) /bin/ls, (root) /bin/kill, /usr/bin/lprm</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Then user <b>dgb</b> is now allowed to run <i>/bin/ls</i> as
    <b>operator</b>, but <i>/bin/kill</i> and <i>/usr/bin/lprm</i> as
    <b>root</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">We can extend this to allow <b>dgb</b> to run <i>/bin/ls</i> with
    either the user or group set to <b>operator</b>:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>dgb	boulder = (operator : operator) /bin/ls, (root) /bin/kill,\
	/usr/bin/lprm</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">While the group portion of the <i>Runas_Spec</i> permits the user
    to run as command with that group, it does not force the user to do so. If
    no group is specified on the command line, the command will run with the
    group listed in the target user's password database entry. The following
    would all be permitted by the sudoers entry above:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ sudo -u operator /bin/ls
$ sudo -u operator -g operator /bin/ls
$ sudo -g operator /bin/ls</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">In the following example, user <b>tcm</b> may run commands that
    access a modem device file with the dialer group.</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>tcm	boulder = (:dialer) /usr/bin/tip, /usr/bin/cu,\
	/usr/local/bin/minicom</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">In this example only the group will be set, the command still runs
    as user <b>tcm</b>. For example:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ sudo -g dialer /usr/bin/cu</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Multiple users and groups may be present in a <i>Runas_Spec</i>,
    in which case the user may select any combination of users and groups via
    the <b>-u</b> and <b>-g</b> options. In this example:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>alan	ALL = (root, bin : operator, system) ALL</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">user <b>alan</b> may run any command as either user <b>root</b> or
    <b>bin</b>, optionally setting the group to operator or system.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Option_Spec"><a class="permalink" href="#Option_Spec">Option_Spec</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A <i>Cmnd</i> may have zero or more options associated with it.
    Options may consist of AppArmor profiles, start and/or end dates and command
    timeouts. Once an option is set for a <i>Cmnd</i>, subsequent <i>Cmnd</i>s
    in the <i>Cmnd_Spec_List</i>, inherit that option unless it is overridden by
    another option. Option names are reserved words in <i>sudoers</i>. This
    means that none of the valid option names (see below) can be used when
    declaring an alias.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="AppArmor_Spec"><a class="permalink" href="#AppArmor_Spec">AppArmor_Spec</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">On systems supporting AppArmor, <i>sudoers</i> file entries may
    optionally specify an AppArmor profile that should be used to confine a
    command. If an AppArmor profile is specified with the command, it will
    override any default values specified in <i>sudoers</i>. Appropriate profile
    transition rules must be defined to support the profile change specified for
    a user.</p>
<p class="Pp">AppArmor profiles can be specified in any way that complies with
    the rules of aa_change_profile(2). For instance, in the following
    <i>sudoers</i> entry</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>alice	ALL = (root)	APPARMOR_PROFILE=my-profile	ALL</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">the user <b>alice</b> may run any command as <b>root</b> under
    confinement by the profile &#x2018;my-profile&#x2019;. You can also stack
    profiles, or allow a user to run commands unconfined by any profile. For
    example:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>bob	ALL = (root)	APPARMOR_PROFILE=foo//&amp;bar	/usr/bin/vi
cathy	ALL = (root)	APPARMOR_PROFILE=unconfined	/bin/ls</pre>

<p class="Pp"><b>sudo</b> allows shell-style <i>wildcards</i> (aka meta or glob

  <dd>For any character &#x2018;x&#x2019;, evaluates to &#x2018;x&#x2019;. This

</dl>
<p class="Pp"><b>These are not regular expressions.</b> Unlike a regular
    expression there is no way to match one or more characters within a
  range.</p>
<p class="Pp">Character classes may be used if your system's glob(3) and
    fnmatch(3) functions support them. However, because the &#x2018;:&#x2019;
    character has special meaning in <i>sudoers</i>, it must be escaped. For
    example:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>/bin/ls [[\:alpha\:]]*</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Would match any file name beginning with a letter.</p>
<p class="Pp">A forward slash (&#x2018;/&#x2019;) will <i>not</i> be matched by
    wildcards used in the file name portion of the command. This is to make a
    path like:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>/usr/bin/*</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">match <i>/usr/bin/who</i> but not <i>/usr/bin/X11/xterm</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When matching the command line arguments, however, a slash

<p class="Pp"><b>Wildcards in command line arguments should be used with

  Wildcards can match any character, including white space. In most cases, it is

<h2 class="Ss" id="Regular_expressions"><a class="permalink" href="#Regular_expressions">Regular
  expressions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Starting with version 1.9.10, it is possible to use regular
    expressions for path names and command line arguments. Regular expressions
    are more expressive than shell-style <i>wildcards</i> and are usually safer
    because they provide a greater degree of control when matching. The type of
    regular expressions supported by <b>sudoers</b> are POSIX extended regular
    expressions, similar to those used by the egrep(1) utility. They are usually
    documented in the regex(7) or re_format(7) manual, depending on the system.
    As an extension, if the regular expression begins with &#x201C;(?i)&#x201D;,
    it will be matched in a case-insensitive manner.</p>
<p class="Pp">In <i>sudoers</i>, regular expressions must start with a
    &#x2018;^&#x2019; character and end with a &#x2018;$&#x2019;. This makes it
    explicit what is, or is not, a regular expression. Either the path name, the
    command line arguments or both may be regular expressions. Because the path
    name and arguments are matched separately, it is even possible to use
    wildcards for the path name and regular expressions for the arguments. It is
    not possible to use a single regular expression to match both the command
    and its arguments. Regular expressions in <i>sudoers</i> are limited to 1024
    characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is no need to escape <i>sudoers</i> special characters in a
    regular expression other than the pound sign (&#x2018;#&#x2019;).</p>
<p class="Pp">In the following example, user <b>john</b> can run the passwd(1)
    command as <b>root</b> on any host but is not allowed to change
    <b>root</b>'s password. This kind of rule is impossible to express safely
    using wildcards.</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>john	ALL = /usr/bin/passwd ^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$,\
              !/usr/bin/passwd root</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">It is also possible to use a regular expression in conjunction
    with <b>sudoedit</b> rules. The following rule would give user bob the
    ability to edit the <i>/etc/motd</i>, <i>/etc/issue</i>, and
    <i>/etc/hosts</i> files only.</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>bob    ALL = sudoedit ^/etc/(motd|issue|hosts)$</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Regular expressions may also be used to match the command itself.
    In this example, a regular expression is used to allow user <b>sid</b> to
    run the <i>/usr/sbin/groupadd</i>, <i>/usr/sbin/groupmod</i>,
    <i>/usr/sbin/groupdel</i>, <i>/usr/sbin/useradd</i>,
    <i>/usr/sbin/usermod</i>, and <i>/usr/sbin/userdel</i> commands as
    <b>root</b>.</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>sid    ALL = ^/usr/sbin/(group|user)(add|mod|del)$</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">One disadvantage of using a regular expression to match the
    command name is that it is not possible to match relative paths such as
    <i>./useradd</i> or <i>../sbin/useradd</i>. This has security implications
    when a regular expression is used for the command name in conjunction with
    the negation operator, &#x2018;!&#x2019;, as such rules can be trivially
    bypassed. Because of this, using a negated regular expression for the
    command name is <b>strongly discouraged</b>. This does not apply to negated
    commands that only use a regular expression to match the command arguments.
    See <i>Regular expressions in command names</i> below for more
  information.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Including_other_files_from_within_sudoers"><a class="permalink" href="#Including_other_files_from_within_sudoers">Including
  other files from within sudoers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">It is possible to include other <i>sudoers</i> files from within
    the <i>sudoers</i> file currently being parsed using the <i>@include</i> and
    <i>@includedir</i> directives. For compatibility with sudo versions prior to
    1.9.1, <i>#include</i> and <i>#includedir</i> are also accepted.</p>
<p class="Pp">An include file can be used, for example, to keep a site-wide
    <i>sudoers</i> file in addition to a local, per-machine file. For the sake
    of this example the site-wide <i>sudoers</i> file will be
    <i>/etc/sudoers</i> and the per-machine one will be
    <i>/etc/sudoers.local</i>. To include <i>/etc/sudoers.local</i> from within
    <i>/etc/sudoers</i> one would use the following line in
  <i>/etc/sudoers</i>:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>@include /etc/sudoers.local</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">When <b>sudo</b> reaches this line it will suspend processing of
    the current file (<i>/etc/sudoers</i>) and switch to
    <i>/etc/sudoers.local</i>. Upon reaching the end of
    <i>/etc/sudoers.local</i>, the rest of <i>/etc/sudoers</i> will be
    processed. Files that are included may themselves include other files. A
    hard limit of 128 nested include files is enforced to prevent include file
    loops.</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with version 1.9.1, the path to the include file may
    contain white space if it is escaped with a backslash (&#x2018;\&#x2019;).
    Alternately, the entire path may be enclosed in double quotes
    (&quot;&quot;), in which case no escaping is necessary. To include a literal
    backslash in the path, &#x2018;\\&#x2019; should be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the path to the include file is not fully-qualified (does not
    begin with a &#x2018;/&#x2019;), it must be located in the same directory as
    the sudoers file it was included from. For example, if <i>/etc/sudoers</i>
    contains the line:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>@include sudoers.local</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">the file that will be included is <i>/etc/sudoers.local</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The file name may also include the &#x2018;%h&#x2019; escape,
    signifying the short form of the host name. In other words, if the machine's
    host name is &#x201C;xerxes&#x201D;, then</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>@include /etc/sudoers.%h</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">will cause <b>sudo</b> to include the file
    <i>/etc/sudoers.xerxes</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>@includedir</i> directive can be used to create a
    <i>sudoers.d</i> directory that the system package manager can drop
    <i>sudoers</i> file rules into as part of package installation. For example,
    given:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>@includedir /etc/sudoers.d</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>sudo</b> will suspend processing of the current file and read
    each file in <i>/etc/sudoers.d</i>, skipping file names that end in
    &#x2018;~&#x2019; or contain a &#x2018;.&#x2019; character to avoid causing
    problems with package manager or editor temporary/backup files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Files are parsed in sorted lexical order. That is,
    <i>/etc/sudoers.d/01_first</i> will be parsed before
    <i>/etc/sudoers.d/10_second</i>. Be aware that because the sorting is
    lexical, not numeric, <i>/etc/sudoers.d/1_whoops</i> would be loaded
    <i>after</i> <i>/etc/sudoers.d/10_second</i>. Using a consistent number of
    leading zeroes in the file names can be used to avoid such problems. After
    parsing the files in the directory, control returns to the file that
    contained the <i>@includedir</i> directive.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike files included via <i>@include</i>, <b>visudo</b> will not
    edit the files in a <i>@includedir</i> directory unless one of them contains
    a syntax error. It is still possible to run <b>visudo</b> with the <b>-f</b>
    flag to edit the files directly, but this will not catch the redefinition of

    it is treated as a user-ID). Both the comment character and any text after
    it, up to the end of the line, are ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">The reserved word <b>ALL</b> is a built-in <i>alias</i> that
    always causes a match to succeed. It can be used wherever one might
    otherwise use a <i>Cmnd_Alias</i>, <i>User_Alias</i>, <i>Runas_Alias</i>, or
    <i>Host_Alias</i>. Attempting to define an <i>alias</i> named <b>ALL</b>
    will result in a syntax error. Using <b>ALL</b> can be dangerous since in a
    command context, it allows the user to run <i>any</i> command on the
  system.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following option names permitted in an <i>Option_Spec</i> are
    also considered reserved words: CHROOT, TIMEOUT, CWD, NOTBEFORE and
    NOTAFTER. Attempting to define an <i>alias</i> with the same name as one of
    the options will result in a syntax error.</p>
<p class="Pp">An exclamation point (&#x2018;!&#x2019;) can be used as a logical
    <i>not</i> operator in a list or <i>alias</i> as well as in front of a
    <i>Cmnd</i>. This allows one to exclude certain values. For the
    &#x2018;!&#x2019; operator to be effective, there must be something for it
    to exclude. For example, to match all users except for <b>root</b> one would
    use:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>ALL, !root</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>ALL</b>, is omitted, as in:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>!root</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">it would explicitly deny <b>root</b> but not match any other
    users. This is different from a true &#x201C;negation&#x201D; operator.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note, however, that using a &#x2018;!&#x2019; in conjunction with
    the built-in <b>ALL</b> alias to allow a user to run &#x201C;all but a
    few&#x201D; commands rarely works as intended (see <i>SECURITY NOTES</i>
    below).</p>
<p class="Pp">Long lines can be continued with a backslash (&#x2018;\&#x2019;)
    as the last character on the line.</p>
<p class="Pp">White space between elements in a list as well as special
    syntactic characters in a <i>User Specification</i> (&#x2018;=&#x2019;,
    &#x2018;:&#x2019;, &#x2018;(&#x2019;, &#x2018;)&#x2019;) is optional.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following characters must be escaped with a backslash
    (&#x2018;\&#x2019;) when used as part of a word (e.g., a user name or host
    name): &#x2018;!&#x2019;, &#x2018;=&#x2019;, &#x2018;:&#x2019;,

<p class="Pp"><b>sudo</b>'s behavior can be modified by <i>Default_Entry</i>
    lines, as explained earlier. A list of all supported Defaults parameters,
    grouped by type, are listed below.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Boolean Flags</b>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="always_query_group_plugin"><a class="permalink" href="#always_query_group_plugin">always_query_group_plugin</a></dt>
  <dd>If a <i>group_plugin</i> is configured, use it to resolve groups of the
      form &#x2018;%group&#x2019; as long as there is not also a system group of
      the same name. Normally, only groups of the form &#x2018;%:group&#x2019;
      are passed to the <i>group_plugin</i>. This flag is <i>off</i> by
    default.</dd>
  <dt id="always_set_home"><a class="permalink" href="#always_set_home">always_set_home</a></dt>
  <dd>If enabled, <b>sudo</b> will set the HOME environment variable to the home
      directory of the target user (which is the <i>runas_default</i> user
      unless the <b>-u</b> option is used). This flag is largely obsolete and
      has no effect unless the <i>env_reset</i> flag has been disabled or HOME
      is present in the <i>env_keep</i> list, both of which are strongly
      discouraged. This flag is <i>off</i> by default.</dd>
  <dt id="authenticate"><a class="permalink" href="#authenticate">authenticate</a></dt>
  <dd>If set, users must authenticate themselves via a password (or other means
      of authentication) before they may run commands. This default may be
      overridden via the PASSWD and NOPASSWD tags. This flag is <i>on</i> by
      default.</dd>
  <dt id="case_insensitive_group"><a class="permalink" href="#case_insensitive_group">case_insensitive_group</a></dt>
  <dd>If enabled, group names in <i>sudoers</i> will be matched in a case
      insensitive manner. This may be necessary when users are stored in LDAP or
      AD. This flag is <i>on</i> by default.</dd>
  <dt id="case_insensitive_user"><a class="permalink" href="#case_insensitive_user">case_insensitive_user</a></dt>
  <dd>If enabled, user names in <i>sudoers</i> will be matched in a case
      insensitive manner. This may be necessary when groups are stored in LDAP
      or AD. This flag is <i>on</i> by default.</dd>
  <dt id="closefrom_override"><a class="permalink" href="#closefrom_override">closefrom_override</a></dt>
  <dd>If set, the user may use the <b>-C</b> option which overrides the default
      starting point at which <b>sudo</b> begins closing open file descriptors.
      This flag is <i>off</i> by default.</dd>
  <dt id="compress_io"><a class="permalink" href="#compress_io">compress_io</a></dt>
  <dd>If set, and <b>sudo</b> is configured to log a command's input or output,
      the I/O logs will be compressed using <b>zlib</b>. This flag is <i>on</i>
      by default when <b>sudo</b> is compiled with <b>zlib</b> support.</dd>
  <dt id="exec_background"><a class="permalink" href="#exec_background">exec_background</a></dt>
  <dd>By default, <b>sudo</b> runs a command as the foreground process as long
      as <b>sudo</b> itself is running in the foreground. When the
      <i>exec_background</i> flag is enabled and the command is being run in a
      pseudo-terminal (due to I/O logging or the <i>use_pty</i> flag), the
      command will be run as a background process. Attempts to read from the
      controlling terminal (or to change terminal settings) will result in the
      command being suspended with the SIGTTIN signal (or SIGTTOU in the case of
      terminal settings). If this happens when <b>sudo</b> is a foreground
      process, the command will be granted the controlling terminal and resumed
      in the foreground with no user intervention required. The advantage of
      initially running the command in the background is that <b>sudo</b> need
      not read from the terminal unless the command explicitly requests it.
      Otherwise, any terminal input must be passed to the command, whether it
      has required it or not (the kernel buffers terminals so it is not possible
      to tell whether the command really wants the input). This is different
      from historic <i>sudo</i> behavior or when the command is not being run in
      a pseudo-terminal.
    <p class="Pp">For this to work seamlessly, the operating system must support
        the automatic restarting of system calls. Unfortunately, not all
        operating systems do this by default, and even those that do may have
        bugs. For example, macOS fails to restart the tcgetattr(3) and
        tcsetattr(3) functions (this is a bug in macOS). Furthermore, because
        this behavior depends on the command stopping with the SIGTTIN or
        SIGTTOU signals, programs that catch these signals and suspend
        themselves with a different signal (usually SIGTOP) will not be
        automatically foregrounded. Some versions of the linux su(1) command
        behave this way. This flag is <i>off</i> by default.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This setting is only supported by version 1.8.7 or higher. It
        has no effect unless I/O logging is enabled or the <i>use_pty</i> flag
        is enabled.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="env_editor"><a class="permalink" href="#env_editor">env_editor</a></dt>
  <dd>If set, <b>visudo</b> will use the value of the SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or
      EDITOR environment variables before falling back on the default editor
      list. <b>visudo</b> is typically run as <b>root</b> so this flag may allow
      a user with <b>visudo</b> privileges to run arbitrary commands as
      <b>root</b> without logging. An alternative is to place a colon-separated
      list of &#x201C;safe&#x201D; editors int the <i>editor</i> setting.
      <b>visudo</b> will then only use SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or EDITOR if they
      match a value specified in <i>editor</i>. If the <i>env_reset</i> flag is
      enabled, the SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL and/or EDITOR environment variables must
      be present in the <i>env_keep</i> list for the <i>env_editor</i> flag to
      function when <b>visudo</b> is invoked via <b>sudo</b>. This flag is
      <i>on</i> by default.</dd>
  <dt id="env_reset"><a class="permalink" href="#env_reset">env_reset</a></dt>
  <dd>If set, <b>sudo</b> will run the command in a minimal environment
      containing the TERM, PATH, HOME, MAIL, SHELL, LOGNAME, USER and SUDO_*
      variables. Any variables in the caller's environment or in the file
      specified by the <i>restricted_env_file</i> setting that match the
      <i>env_keep</i> and <i>env_check</i> lists are then added, followed by any
      variables present in the file specified by the <i>env_file</i> setting (if
      any). The contents of the <i>env_keep</i> and <i>env_check</i> lists, as
      modified by global Defaults parameters in <i>sudoers</i>, are displayed
      when <b>sudo</b> is run by <b>root</b> with the <b>-V</b> option. If the
      <i>secure_path</i> setting is enabled, its value will be used for the PATH
      environment variable. This flag is <i>on</i> by default.</dd>
  <dt id="fast_glob"><a class="permalink" href="#fast_glob">fast_glob</a></dt>
  <dd>Normally, <b>sudo</b> uses the glob(3) function to do shell-style globbing
      when matching path names. However, since it accesses the file system,
      glob(3) can take a long time to complete for some patterns, especially
      when the pattern references a network file system that is mounted on
      demand (auto mounted). The <i>fast_glob</i> flag causes <b>sudo</b> to use
      the fnmatch(3) function, which does not access the file system to do its
      matching. The disadvantage of <i>fast_glob</i> is that it is unable to
      match relative paths such as <i>./ls</i> or <i>../bin/ls</i>. This has
      security implications when path names that include globbing characters are
      used with the negation operator, &#x2018;!&#x2019;, as such rules can be
      trivially bypassed. As such, this flag should not be used when the
      <i>sudoers</i> file contains rules that contain negated path names which
      include globbing characters. This flag is <i>off</i> by default.</dd>
  <dt id="log_passwords"><a class="permalink" href="#log_passwords">log_passwords</a></dt>
  <dd>Most programs that require a user's password will disable echo before
      reading the password to avoid displaying the plaintext password on the
      screen. However, if terminal input is being logged (see <i>I/O
      LOGGING</i>), the password will still be present in the I/O log. If the
      <i>log_passwords</i> option is disabled, <b>sudoers</b> will attempt to
      prevent passwords from being logged. It does this by using the regular
      expressions in <i>passprompt_regex</i> to match a password prompt in the
      terminal output buffer. When a match is found, input characters in the I/O
      log will be replaced with &#x2018;*&#x2019; until either a line feed or
      carriage return is found in the terminal input or a new terminal output
      buffer is received. If, however, a program displays characters as the user
      types (such as <b>sudo</b> when <i>pwfeedback</i> is set), only the first
      character of the password will be replaced in the I/O log. This option has
      no effect unless <i>log_input</i> or <i>log_ttyin</i> are also set. This
      flag is <i>on</i> by default.
    <p class="Pp">This setting is only supported by version 1.9.10 or
      higher.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="fqdn"><a class="permalink" href="#fqdn">fqdn</a></dt>
  <dd>Set this flag if you want to put fully qualified host names in the
      <i>sudoers</i> file when the local host name (as returned by the
      &#x2018;hostname&#x2019; command) does not contain the domain name. In
      other words, instead of myhost you would use myhost.mydomain.edu. You may
      still use the short form if you wish (and even mix the two). This flag is
      only effective when the &#x201C;canonical&#x201D; host name, as returned
      by the getaddrinfo(3) or gethostbyname(3) function, is a fully-qualified
      domain name. This is usually the case when the system is configured to use
      DNS for host name resolution.
    <p class="Pp">If the system is configured to use the <i>/etc/hosts</i> file
        in preference to DNS, the &#x201C;canonical&#x201D; host name may not be
        fully-qualified. The order that sources are queried for host name
        resolution is usually specified in the <i>/etc/nsswitch.conf</i>,
        <i>/etc/netsvc.conf</i>, <i>/etc/host.conf</i>, or, in some cases,
        <i>/etc/resolv.conf</i> file. In the <i>/etc/hosts</i> file, the first
        host name of the entry is considered to be the &#x201C;canonical&#x201D;
        name; subsequent names are aliases that are not used by <b>sudoers</b>.
        For example, the following hosts file line for the machine
        &#x201C;xyzzy&#x201D; has the fully-qualified domain name as the
        &#x201C;canonical&#x201D; host name, and the short version as an
      alias.</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">192.168.1.1 xyzzy.sudo.ws xyzzy</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If the machine's hosts file entry is not formatted properly, the
    <i>fqdn</i> flag will not be effective if it is queried before DNS.</p>
<p class="Pp">Beware that when using DNS for host name resolution, turning on
    <i>fqdn</i> requires <b>sudoers</b> to make DNS lookups which renders
    <b>sudo</b> unusable if DNS stops working (for example if the machine is
    disconnected from the network). Just like with the hosts file, you must use
    the &#x201C;canonical&#x201D; name as DNS knows it. That is, you may not use
    a host alias (CNAME entry) due to performance issues and the fact that there
    is no way to get all aliases from DNS.</p>

<p class="Pp">By default, <b>sudoers</b> logs messages via syslog(3). The
    <i>date</i>, <i>hostname</i>, and <i>progname</i> fields are added by the

    vary in format on different systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">The maximum size of syslog messages varies from system to system.
    The <i>syslog_maxlen</i> setting can be used to change the maximum syslog
    message size from the default value of 980 bytes. For more information, see

<p class="Pp">If the <i>logfile</i> option is set, <b>sudoers</b> will log to a
    local file, such as <i>/var/log/sudo</i>. When logging to a file,
    <b>sudoers</b> uses a format similar to syslog(3), with a few important
    differences:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>The <i>progname</i> field is not present.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>The <i>hostname</i> is only logged if the <i>log_host</i> option is
      enabled.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>The date does not include the year unless the <i>log_year</i> option is

  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>Lines that are longer than <i>loglinelen</i> characters (80 by default)
      are word-wrapped and continued on the next line with a four character
      indent. This makes entries easier to read for a human being, but makes it
      more difficult to use grep(1) on the log files. If the <i>loglinelen</i>
      option is set to 0 (or negated with a &#x2018;!&#x2019;), word wrap will
      be disabled.</dd>

  LOGGING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When I/O logging is enabled, <b>sudo</b> will runs the command in
    a pseudo-terminal, logging user input and/or output, depending on which
    <b>sudoers</b> flags are enabled. There are five distinct types of I/O that
    can be logged, each with a corresponding <b>sudoers</b> flag.</p>
<table class="tbl">

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>standard error</td>
    <td>log_stderr</td>
    <td>output to a pipe or a file</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p class="Pp">In addition to flags described the above, the <i>log_input</i>
    flag and LOG_INPUT command tag set both <i>log_ttyin</i> and
    <i>log_stdin</i>. The <i>log_output</i> flag and LOG_OUTPUT command tag set
    <i>log_ttyout</i>, <i>log_stdout</i>, and <i>log_stderr</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">To capture terminal input and output, <b>sudo</b> run the command
    in a pseudo-terminal, logging the input and output before passing it on to
    the user. To capture the standard input, standard output or standard error,
    <b>sudo</b> uses a pipe to interpose itself between the input or output
    stream, logging the I/O before passing it to the other end of the pipe.</p>
<p class="Pp">I/O can be logged either to the local machine or to a remote log
    server. For local logs, I/O is logged to the directory specified by the
    <i>iolog_dir</i> option (<i>/var/log/sudo-io</i> by default) using a unique
    session ID that is included in the <b>sudo</b> log line, prefixed with
    &#x2018;TSID=&#x2019;. The <i>iolog_file</i> option may be used to control
    the format of the session ID. For remote logs, the <i>log_servers</i>
    setting is used to specify one or more log servers running
    <b>sudo_logsrvd</b> or another server that implements the protocol described
    by sudo_logsrv.proto(5).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="I/O_logging_pitfals"><a class="permalink" href="#I/O_logging_pitfals">I/O
  logging pitfals</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When logging standard input, anything sent to the standard input
    will be consumed, regardless of whether or not the command run via
    <b>sudo</b> is actively reading the standard input. This may have unexpected
    results when using <b>sudo</b> in a shell script that expects to process the
    standard input. For example, given the following shell script:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>#!/bin/sh
sudo echo testing
echo done</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">It will behave as expected when the script is passed to the shell
    as a an argument:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ sh test.sh
testing
done</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">However, if the script is passed to the shell on the standard
    input, the &#x2018;sudo echo testing&#x2019; command will consume the rest
    of the script. This means that the &#x2018;echo done&#x2019; statement is
    never executed.</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ sh -s &lt; test.sh
testing</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">There are several ways to work around this problem:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Redirect the standard input from <i>/dev/null</i> when running a command
      via <b>sudo</b> that does not need to read the standard input.
    <pre>
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>sudo echo testing &lt; /dev/null</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Pass the script to the shell by path name instead of via the standard
      input.
    <pre>
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>sh test.sh</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>Disable logging the standard input for commands that do not need to read
      the standard input.
    <pre>
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Defaults!/bin/echo !log_stdin</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Depending on the command, it may not be desirable to log the
    standard input or standard output. For example, I/O logging of commands that
    send or receive large amount of data via the standard output or standard
    input such as rsync(1) and tar(1) could fill up the log file system with
    superfluous data. It is possible to disable logging of the standard input
    and standard output for such commands as follows:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Cmnd_Alias COPY_CMDS = /usr/bin/tar, /usr/bin/cpio, /usr/bin/rsync
# Log input and output but omit stdin and stdout when copying files.
Defaults log_input, log_output
Defaults!COPY_CMDS !log_stdin, !log_stdout</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">However, be aware that using the <i>log_input</i> flag or the
    LOG_INPUT command tag will also enable <i>log_stdin</i>. Likewise, the
    <i>log_ouput</i> flag or the LOG_OUTPUT command tag will enable
    <i>log_stdout</i> and <i>log_stderr.</i> Careful ordering of rules may be
    necessary to achieve the results that you expect.</p>

<p class="Pp">All files other than <i>log</i> are compressed in gzip format
    unless the <i>compress_io</i> flag has been disabled. Due to buffering, it
    is not normally possible to display the I/O logs in real-time as the program
    is executing. The I/O log data will not be complete until the program run by
    <b>sudo</b> has exited or has been terminated by a signal. The
    <i>iolog_flush</i> flag can be used to disable buffering, in which case I/O
    log data is written to disk as soon as it is available. The output portion
    of an I/O log file can be viewed with the sudoreplay(8) utility, which can
    also be used to list or search the available logs.</p>
<p class="Pp">User input may contain sensitive information such as passwords
    (even if they are not echoed to the screen), which will be stored in the log
    file unencrypted. In most cases, logging the command output via
    <i>log_output</i> or LOG_OUTPUT is all that is required. When logging input,
    consider disabling the <i>log_passwords</i> flag.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since each session's I/O logs are stored in a separate directory,
    traditional log rotation utilities cannot be used to limit the number of I/O
    logs. The simplest way to limit the number of I/O is by setting the
    <i>maxseq</i> option to the maximum number of logs you wish to store. Once
    the I/O log sequence number reaches <i>maxseq</i>, it will be reset to zero
    and <b>sudoers</b> will truncate and re-use any existing I/O logs.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Limitations_of_the_"><a class="permalink" href="#Limitations_of_the_">Limitations
  of the &#x2018;!&#x2019; operator</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">It is generally not effective to &#x201C;subtract&#x201D; commands
    from <b>ALL</b> using the &#x2018;!&#x2019; operator. A user can trivially
    circumvent this by copying the desired command to a different name and then
    executing that. For example:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>bill	ALL = ALL, !SU, !SHELLS</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">Doesn't really prevent <b>bill</b> from running the commands
    listed in SU or SHELLS since he can simply copy those commands to a
    different name, or use a shell escape from an editor or other program.
    Therefore, these kind of restrictions should be considered advisory at best
    (and reinforced by policy).</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, if a user has sudo <b>ALL</b> there is nothing to
    prevent them from creating their own program that gives them a <b>root</b>
    shell (or making their own copy of a shell) regardless of any
    &#x2018;!&#x2019; elements in the user specification.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Security_implications_of_"><a class="permalink" href="#Security_implications_of_">Security
  implications of <i>fast_glob</i></a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>fast_glob</i> option is in use, it is not possible to
    reliably negate commands where the path name includes globbing (aka
    wildcard) characters. This is because the C library's fnmatch(3) function
    cannot resolve relative paths. While this is typically only an inconvenience
    for rules that grant privileges, it can result in a security issue for rules
    that subtract or revoke privileges.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, given the following <i>sudoers</i> file entry:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>john	ALL = /usr/bin/passwd [a-zA-Z0-9]*, /usr/bin/chsh [a-zA-Z0-9]*,\
              /usr/bin/chfn [a-zA-Z0-9]*, !/usr/bin/* root</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">User <b>john</b> can still run &#x2018;/usr/bin/passwd
    root&#x2019; if <i>fast_glob</i> is enabled by changing to <i>/usr/bin</i>
    and running &#x2018;./passwd root&#x2019; instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another potential issue is that when <b>sudo</b> executes the
    command, it must use the command or path specified by the user instead of a
    path listed in the <i>sudoers</i> file. This may lead to a time of check
    versus time of use race condition.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Wildcards_in_command_arguments"><a class="permalink" href="#Wildcards_in_command_arguments">Wildcards

<p class="Pp">Command line arguments are matched as a single, concatenated
    string. This mean a wildcard character such as &#x2018;?&#x2019; or
    &#x2018;*&#x2019; will match across word boundaries, which may be
    unexpected. For example, while a sudoers entry like:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>%operator ALL = /bin/cat /var/log/messages*</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">will allow command like:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ sudo cat /var/log/messages.1</pre>

<p class="Pp">It will also allow:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ sudo cat /var/log/messages /etc/shadow</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">which is probably not what was intended. A safer alternative is to
    use a regular expression for matching command line arguments. The above
    example can be rewritten as a regular expression:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>%operator ALL = /bin/cat ^/var/log/messages[^[:space:]]*$</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">The regular expression will only match a single file with a name
    that begins with <i>/var/log/messages</i> and does not include any white
    space in the name. It is often better to do command line processing outside
    of the <i>sudoers</i> file in a scripting language for anything
  non-trivial.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Regular_expressions_in_command_names"><a class="permalink" href="#Regular_expressions_in_command_names">Regular

<h2 class="Ss" id="Preventing_shell_escapes"><a class="permalink" href="#Preventing_shell_escapes">Preventing
  shell escapes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Once <b>sudo</b> executes a program, that program is free to do
    whatever it pleases, including run other programs. This can be a security
    issue since it is not uncommon for a program to allow shell escapes, which
    lets a user bypass <b>sudo</b>'s access control and logging. Common programs
    that permit shell escapes include shells (obviously), editors, paginators,
    mail, and terminal programs.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are four basic approaches to this problem:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="restrict"><a class="permalink" href="#restrict">restrict</a></dt>
  <dd>Avoid giving users access to commands that allow the user to run arbitrary
      commands. Many editors have a restricted mode where shell escapes are
      disabled, though <b>sudoedit</b> is a better solution to running editors
      via <b>sudo</b>. Due to the large number of programs that offer shell
      escapes, restricting users to the set of programs that do not is often
      unworkable.</dd>
  <dt id="intercept~2"><a class="permalink" href="#intercept~2">intercept</a></dt>
  <dd>On most systems, <b>sudo</b>'s <i>intercept</i> functionality can be used
      to transparently intercept an attempt to run a new command, allow or deny
      it based on <i>sudoers</i> rules, and log the result. For example, this
      can be used to restrict the commands run from within a privileged shell or
      editor.
    <p class="Pp">There are two underlying mechanisms that may be used to
        implement <i>intercept</i> mode: <i>dso</i> and <i>trace</i>. The
        <i>intercept_type</i> setting can be used to select between them.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The first mechanism, <i>dso</i>, overrides the standard C
        library functions that are used to execute a command. It does this by
        setting an environment variable (usually LD_PRELOAD) to the path of a
        dynamic shared object, or shared library, containing custom versions of
        the execve(2), execl(3), execle(3), execlp(3), execv(3), execvp(3),
        execvpe(3), and system(3) library functions that connect back to
        <b>sudo</b> for a policy decision. Note, however, that this applies only
        to dynamically-linked executables. It is not possible to intercept
        commands for statically-linked executables or executables that run under
        binary emulation this way. Because most dynamic loaders ignore
        LD_PRELOAD (or the equivalent) when running set-user-ID and set-group-ID
        programs, <b>sudoers</b> will not permit such programs to be run in
        <i>intercept</i> mode by default. The <i>dso</i> mechanism is
        incompatible with <b>sudo</b>'s SELinux RBAC support (but see below).
        SELinux disables LD_PRELOAD by default and interferes with file
        descriptor inheritance, which <b>sudo</b> relies on.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The second mechanism, <i>trace</i>, is available on Linux
        systems that support seccomp(2) filtering. It uses ptrace(2) and
        seccomp(2) to intercept the execve(2) system call instead of pre-loading
        a dynamic shared object. Both static and dynamic executables are
        supported and it is compatible with <b>sudo</b>'s SELinux RBAC mode.
        Functions utilizing the execveat(2) system call, such as fexecve(3), are
        not currently intercepted.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <i>intercept</i> feature is known to work on Solaris,
        *BSD, Linux, macOS, HP-UX 11.x and AIX 5.3 and above. It should be
        supported on most operating systems that support the LD_PRELOAD
        environment variable or an equivalent. It is not possible to intercept
        shell built-in commands or restrict the ability to read or write
        sensitive files from within a shell.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To enable intercept mode on a per-command basis, use the
        INTERCEPT tag as documented in the User Specification section above.
        Here is that example again:</p>
    <pre>
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>chuck	research = INTERCEPT: ALL</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">This allows user <b>chuck</b> to run any command on the machine
    &#x201C;research&#x201D; in intercept mode. Any commands run via shell
    escapes will be validated and logged by <b>sudo</b>. If you are unsure
    whether or not your system is capable of supporting <i>intercept</i>, you
    can always just try it out and check whether or not external commands run
    via a shell are logged when <i>intercept</i> is enabled.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is an inherent race condition between when a command is
    checked against <b>sudoers</b> rules and when it is actually executed. If a
    user is allowed to run arbitrary commands, they may be able to change the
    execve(2) arguments in the program after the <b>sudoers</b> policy check has
    completed but before the new command is executed. Starting with version
    1.9.12, the <i>trace</i> method will verify that the command and its
    arguments have not changed after execve(2) has completed but before
    execution of the new program has had a chance to run. This is not the case
    with the <i>dso</i> method. See the description of the
    <i>intercept_verify</i> setting for more information.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="log"><a class="permalink" href="#log">log</a></dt>
  <dd>There are two separate but related ways to log additional commands. The
      first is to enable I/O logging using the <i>log_output</i> flag. This will
      log the command's output but will not create an event log entry when the
      additional command is run. The second is to enable the <i>log_subcmds</i>
      flag in <i>sudoers</i> which will create an event log entry every time a
      new command is run. If I/O logging is also enabled, the log entry will
      include a time offset into the I/O log to indicate when the command was
      run. This offset can be passed to the sudoreplay(8) utility to replay the
      I/O log at the exact moment when the command was run. The
      <i>log_subcmds</i> flag uses the same mechanism as <i>intercept</i> (see
      above) and has the same limitations.</dd>
  <dt id="noexec~2"><a class="permalink" href="#noexec~2">noexec</a></dt>
  <dd><b>sudo</b>'s <i>noexec</i> functionality can be used to prevent a program
      run by <b>sudo</b> from executing any other programs. On most systems, it
      uses the same LD_PRELOAD mechanism as <i>intercept</i> (see above) and
      thus the same caveats apply. The <i>noexec</i> functionality is capable of
      blocking execution of commands run via the execve(2), execl(3), execle(3),
      execlp(3), exect(3), execv(3), execveat(3), execvP(3), execvp(3),
      execvpe(3), fexecve(3), popen(3), posix_spawn(3), posix_spawnp(3),
      system(3), and wordexp(3) functions. On Linux, a seccomp(2) filter is used
      to implement <i>noexec</i>. On Solaris 10 and higher, <i>noexec</i> uses
      Solaris privileges instead of the LD_PRELOAD environment variable.
    <p class="Pp">To enable <i>noexec</i> for a command, use the NOEXEC tag as
        documented in the User Specification section above. Here is that example
        again:</p>
    <pre>
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>aaron	shanty = NOEXEC: /usr/bin/more, /usr/bin/vi</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">This allows user <b>aaron</b> to run <i>/usr/bin/more</i> and
    <i>/usr/bin/vi</i> with <i>noexec</i> enabled. This will prevent those two
    commands from executing other commands (such as a shell). If you are unsure
    whether or not your system is capable of supporting <i>noexec</i> you can
    always just try it out and check whether shell escapes work when
    <i>noexec</i> is enabled.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Restricting shell escapes is not a panacea. Programs running as
    <b>root</b> are still capable of many potentially hazardous operations (such
    as changing or overwriting files) that could lead to unintended privilege
    escalation. In the specific case of an editor, a safer approach is to give
    the user permission to run <b>sudoedit</b> (see below).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Secure_editing"><a class="permalink" href="#Secure_editing">Secure
  editing</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>sudoers</b> plugin includes <b>sudoedit</b> support which
    allows users to securely edit files with the editor of their choice. As
    <b>sudoedit</b> is a built-in command, it must be specified in the
    <i>sudoers</i> file without a leading path. However, it may take command
    line arguments just as a normal command does. Wildcards used in
    <i>sudoedit</i> command line arguments are expected to be path names, so a
    forward slash (&#x2018;/&#x2019;) will not be matched by a wildcard.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike other <b>sudo</b> commands, the editor is run with the
    permissions of the invoking user and with the environment unmodified. More
    information may be found in the description of the <b>-e</b> option in
    sudo(8).</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, to allow user operator to edit the &#x201C;message of
    the day&#x201D; file on any machine:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>operator ALL = sudoedit /etc/motd</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">The operator user then runs <b>sudoedit</b> as follows:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ sudoedit /etc/motd</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">The editor will run as the operator user, not <b>root</b>, on a
    temporary copy of <i>/etc/motd</i>. After the file has been edited,
    <i>/etc/motd</i> will be updated with the contents of the temporary
  copy.</p>
<p class="Pp">Users should <i>never</i> be granted <b>sudoedit</b> permission to
    edit a file that resides in a directory the user has write access to, either
    directly or via a wildcard. If the user has write access to the directory it
    is possible to replace the legitimate file with a link to another file,
    allowing the editing of arbitrary files. To prevent this, starting with
    version 1.8.16, symbolic links will not be followed in writable directories
    and <b>sudoedit</b> will refuse to edit a file located in a writable
    directory unless the <i>sudoedit_checkdir</i> option has been disabled or
    the invoking user is <b>root</b>. Additionally, in version 1.8.15 and
    higher, <b>sudoedit</b> will refuse to open a symbolic link unless either
    the <i>sudoedit_follow</i> option is enabled or the <i>sudoedit</i> command
    is prefixed with the FOLLOW tag in the <i>sudoers</i> file.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Time_stamp_file_checks"><a class="permalink" href="#Time_stamp_file_checks">Time
  stamp file checks</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>sudoers</b> will check the ownership of its time stamp
    directory (<i>/var/db/sudo/ts</i> by default) and ignore the directory's
    contents if it is not owned by <b>root</b> or if it is writable by a user
    other than <b>root</b>. Older versions of <b>sudo</b> stored time stamp
    files in <i>/tmp</i>; this is no longer recommended as it may be possible
    for a user to create the time stamp themselves on systems that allow
    unprivileged users to change the ownership of files they create.</p>
<p class="Pp">While the time stamp directory <i>should</i> be cleared at reboot
    time, not all systems contain a <i>/run</i> or <i>/var/run</i> directory. To
    avoid potential problems, <b>sudoers</b> will ignore time stamp files that
    date from before the machine booted on systems where the boot time is
    available.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some systems with graphical desktop environments allow
    unprivileged users to change the system clock. Since <b>sudoers</b> relies
    on the system clock for time stamp validation, it may be possible on such
    systems for a user to run <b>sudo</b> for longer than
    <i>timestamp_timeout</i> by setting the clock back. To combat this,
    <b>sudoers</b> uses a monotonic clock (which never moves backwards) for its
    time stamps if the system supports it.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>sudoers</b> will not honor time stamps set far in the future.
    Time stamps with a date greater than current_time + 2 * TIMEOUT will be
    ignored and <b>sudoers</b> will log and complain.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>timestamp_type</i> option is set to &#x201C;tty&#x201D;,
    the time stamp record includes the device number of the terminal the user
    authenticated with. This provides per-terminal granularity but time stamp
    records may still outlive the user's session.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless the <i>timestamp_type</i> option is set to
    &#x201C;global&#x201D;, the time stamp record also includes the session ID
    of the process that last authenticated. This prevents processes in different
    terminal sessions from using the same time stamp record. On systems where a
    process's start time can be queried, the start time of the session leader is
    recorded in the time stamp record. If no terminal is present or the
    <i>timestamp_type</i> option is set to &#x201C;ppid&#x201D;, the start time
    of the parent process is used instead. In most cases this will prevent a
    time stamp record from being re-used without the user entering a password
    when logging out and back in again.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <b>sudoers</b> plugin uses the same debug flag format as the
    <b>sudo</b> front-end: <i>subsystem</i>@<i>priority</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The priorities used by <b>sudoers</b>, in order of decreasing
    severity, are: <i>crit</i>, <i>err</i>, <i>warn</i>, <i>notice</i>,
    <i>diag</i>, <i>info</i>, <i>trace</i>, and <i>debug</i>. Each priority,
    when specified, also includes all priorities higher than it. For example, a
    priority of <i>notice</i> would include debug messages logged at
    <i>notice</i> and higher.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following subsystems are used by the <b>sudoers</b>
  plugin:</p>

<p class="Pp">The <i>sudoers</i> file should <b>always</b> be edited by the
    <b>visudo</b> utility which locks the file and checks for syntax errors. If
    <i>sudoers</i> contains syntax errors, <b>sudo</b> may refuse to run, which
    is a serious problem if <b>sudo</b> is your only method of obtaining
    superuser privileges. Recent versions of <b>sudoers</b> will attempt to
    recover after a syntax error by ignoring the rest of the line after
    encountering an error. Older versions of <b>sudo</b> will not run if
    <i>sudoers</i> contains a syntax error.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using netgroups of machines (as opposed to users), if you
    store fully qualified host name in the netgroup (as is usually the case),
    you either need to have the machine's host name be fully qualified as
    returned by the <i>hostname</i> command or use the <i>fqdn</i> option in
    <i>sudoers</i>.</p>
