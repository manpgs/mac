<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The file <code class="Nm">ttys</code> contains information that is
    used by various routines to initialize and control the use of terminal
    special files. This information is read with the
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/getttyent">getttyent(3)</a> library routines. There
    is one line in the <code class="Nm">ttys</code> file per special device
    file. Fields are separated by tabs and/or spaces. Fields comprised of more
    than one word should be enclosed in double quotes (``&quot;''). Blank lines
    and comments may appear anywhere in the file; comments are delimited by hash
    marks (``#'') and new lines. Any unspecified fields will default to
  null.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first field is normally the name of the terminal special file
    as it is found in <span class="Pa">/dev</span>. However, it can be any
    arbitrary string when the associated command is not related to a tty.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second field of the file is the command to execute for the
    line, usually <a class="Xr" href="../8/getty">getty(8)</a>, which
    initializes and opens the line, setting the speed, waiting for a user name
    and executing the <a class="Xr" href="../1/login">login(1)</a> program. It
    can be, however, any desired command, for example the start up for a window
    system terminal emulator or some other daemon process, and can contain
    multiple words if quoted.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third field is the type of terminal usually connected to that
    tty line, normally the one found in the
    <a class="Xr" href="../5/termcap">termcap(5)</a> data base file. The
    environment variable <code class="Ev">TERM</code> is initialized with the
    value by either <a class="Xr" href="../8/getty">getty(8)</a> or
    <a class="Xr" href="../1/login">login(1)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The remaining fields set flags in the
    <var class="Fa">ty_status</var> entry (see
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/getttyent">getttyent(3)</a>), specify a window
    system process that <a class="Xr" href="../8/launchd">launchd(8)</a> will
    maintain for the terminal line.</p>
<p class="Pp">As flag values, the strings ``on'' and ``off'' specify that
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/launchd">launchd(8)</a> should (should not) execute
    the command given in the second field, while ``secure'' (if ``on'' is also
    specified) allows users with a uid of 0 to login on this line. The flags
    ``local'', ``rtscts'', ``mdmbuf'', and ``softcar'' modify the default
    behaviour of the terminal line, and their actions are driver dependent. The
    ``local'' flag causes the driver to treat the line as if it locally
    connected. The ``rtscts'' flag instructs the driver to use RTS/CTS hardware
    flow control, if possible. The ``mdmbuf'' flag instructs the driver to use
    DTR/DCD flow control, if possible. The ``softcar'' flag causes the driver to
    ignore hardware carrier on the line. These flag fields should not be
  quoted.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="before">The string ``window='' may be followed by a quoted
    command string which <a class="Xr" href="../8/launchd">launchd(8)</a> will
    execute <a class="permalink" href="#before"><i class="Em">before</i></a>
    starting the command specified by the second field.</p>

  SEQUENCES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Numeric sequences of terminals can be represented in a more
    compact format. A matching pair of square bracket may enclose two numbers
    (the start and stop values), separated by a hyphen. The numbers are assumed
    to be decimal, unless prefixed with ``0x'', in which case they are
    interpreted as hexadecimal. The number of characters (not including any
    ``0x'') in the starting value gives the minimum width; sequence values are
    zero padded up to this width. Thus ``tty[00-07]'' represents the eight
    terminals ``tty00'' through ``tty07''.</p>
