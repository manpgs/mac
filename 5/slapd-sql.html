<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The primary purpose of this <b>slapd</b>(8) backend is to PRESENT
    information stored in some RDBMS as an LDAP subtree without any programming
    (some SQL and maybe stored procedures can't be considered programming,
    anyway ;).</p>
<p class="Pp">That is, for example, when you (some ISP) have account information
    you use in an RDBMS, and want to use modern solutions that expect such
    information in LDAP (to authenticate users, make email lookups etc.). Or you
    want to synchronize or distribute information between different
    sites/applications that use RDBMSes and/or LDAP. Or whatever else...</p>
<p class="Pp">It is NOT designed as a general-purpose backend that uses RDBMS
    instead of BerkeleyDB (as the standard BDB backend does), though it can be
    used as such with several limitations. You can take a look at
    <b>http://www.openldap.org/faq/index.cgi?file=378</b> (OpenLDAP
    FAQ-O-Matic/General LDAP FAQ/Directories vs. conventional databases) to find
    out more on this point.</p>
<p class="Pp">The idea (detailed below) is to use some meta-information to
    translate LDAP queries to SQL queries, leaving relational schema untouched,
    so that old applications can continue using it without any modifications.
    This allows SQL and LDAP applications to inter-operate without replication,
    and exchange data as needed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The SQL backend is designed to be tunable to virtually any
    relational schema without having to change source (through that
    meta-information mentioned). Also, it uses ODBC to connect to RDBMSes, and
    is highly configurable for SQL dialects RDBMSes may use, so it may be used
    for integration and distribution of data on different RDBMSes, OSes, hosts
    etc., in other words, in highly heterogeneous environment.</p>
<p class="Pp">This backend is <i>experimental</i>.</p>

<p class="Pp">These <b>slapd.conf</b> options apply to the SQL backend database,
    which means that they must follow a &quot;database sql&quot; line and come
    before any subsequent &quot;backend&quot; or &quot;database&quot; lines.
    Other database options not specific to this backend are described in the
    <b>slapd.conf</b>(5) manual page.</p>

<p class="Pp">These statements are used to modify the default behavior of the
    backend according to issues of the dialect of the RDBMS. The first options
    essentially refer to string and DN normalization when building filters. LDAP
    normalization is more than upper- (or lower-)casing everything; however, as
    a reasonable trade-off, for case-sensitive RDBMSes the backend can be
    instructed to uppercase strings and DNs by providing the <b>upper_func</b>
    directive. Some RDBMSes, to use functions on arbitrary data types, e.g.
    string constants, requires a cast, which is triggered by the
    <b>upper_needs_cast</b> directive. If required, a string cast function can
    be provided as well, by using the <b>strcast_func</b> directive. Finally, a
    custom string concatenation pattern may be required; it is provided by the
    <b>concat_pattern</b> directive.</p>

<p class="Pp">Almost everything mentioned later is illustrated in examples
    located in the <b>servers/slapd/back-sql/rdbms_depend/</b> directory in the
    OpenLDAP source tree, and contains scripts for generating sample database
    for Oracle, MS SQL Server, mySQL and more (including PostgreSQL and IBM
    db2).</p>
<p class="Pp">The first thing that one must arrange is what set of LDAP object
    classes can present your RDBMS information.</p>
<p class="Pp">The easiest way is to create an objectClass for each entity you
    had in ER-diagram when designing your relational schema. Any relational
    schema, no matter how normalized it is, was designed after some model of
    your application's domain (for instance, accounts, services etc. in ISP),
    and is used in terms of its entities, not just tables of normalized schema.
    It means that for every attribute of every such instance there is an
    effective SQL query that loads its values.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also you might want your object classes to conform to some of the
    standard schemas like inetOrgPerson etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">Nevertheless, when you think it out, we must define a way to
    translate LDAP operation requests to (a series of) SQL queries. Let us deal
    with the SEARCH operation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example: Let's suppose that we store information about persons
    working in our organization in two tables:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  PERSONS              PHONES
  ----------           -------------
  id integer           id integer
  first_name varchar   pers_id integer references persons(id)
  last_name varchar    phone
  middle_name varchar
  ...</pre>
<p class="Pp">(PHONES contains telephone numbers associated with persons). A
    person can have several numbers, then PHONES contains several records with
    corresponding pers_id, or no numbers (and no records in PHONES with such
    pers_id). An LDAP objectclass to present such information could look like
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  person
  -------
  MUST cn
  MAY telephoneNumber $ firstName $ lastName
  ...</pre>
<p class="Pp">To fetch all values for cn attribute given person ID, we construct
    the query:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  SELECT CONCAT(persons.first_name,' ',persons.last_name)
      AS cn FROM persons WHERE persons.id=?</pre>
<p class="Pp">for telephoneNumber we can use:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  SELECT phones.phone AS telephoneNumber FROM persons,phones
      WHERE persons.id=phones.pers_id AND persons.id=?</pre>
<p class="Pp">If we wanted to service LDAP requests with filters like
    (telephoneNumber=123*), we would construct something like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  SELECT ... FROM persons,phones
      WHERE persons.id=phones.pers_id
          AND persons.id=?
          AND phones.phone like '%1%2%3%'</pre>
<p class="Pp">(note how the telephoneNumber match is expanded in multiple
    wildcards to account for interspersed ininfluential chars like spaces,
    dashes and so; this occurs by design because telephoneNumber is defined
    after a specially recognized syntax). So, if we had information about what
    tables contain values for each attribute, how to join these tables and
    arrange these values, we could try to automatically generate such
    statements, and translate search filters to SQL WHERE clauses.</p>
<p class="Pp">To store such information, we add three more tables to our schema
    and fill it with data (see samples):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  ldap_oc_mappings (some columns are not listed for clarity)
  ---------------
  id=1
  name=&quot;person&quot;
  keytbl=&quot;persons&quot;
  keycol=&quot;id&quot;</pre>
<p class="Pp">This table defines a mapping between objectclass (its name held in
    the &quot;name&quot; column), and a table that holds the primary key for
    corresponding entities. For instance, in our example, the person entity,
    which we are trying to present as &quot;person&quot; objectclass, resides in
    two tables (persons and phones), and is identified by the persons.id column
    (that we will call the primary key for this entity). Keytbl and keycol thus
    contain &quot;persons&quot; (name of the table), and &quot;id&quot; (name of
    the column).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  ldap_attr_mappings (some columns are not listed for clarity)
  -----------
  id=1
  oc_map_id=1
  name=&quot;cn&quot;
  sel_expr=&quot;CONCAT(persons.first_name,' ',persons.last_name)&quot;
  from_tbls=&quot;persons&quot;
  join_where=NULL
  ************
  id=&lt;n&gt;
  oc_map_id=1
  name=&quot;telephoneNumber&quot;
  sel_expr=&quot;phones.phone&quot;
  from_tbls=&quot;persons,phones&quot;
  join_where=&quot;phones.pers_id=persons.id&quot;</pre>
<p class="Pp">This table defines mappings between LDAP attributes and SQL
    queries that load their values. Note that, unlike LDAP schema, these are not
    <b>attribute types</b> - the attribute &quot;cn&quot; for &quot;person&quot;
    objectclass can have its values in different tables than &quot;cn&quot; for
    some other objectclass, so attribute mappings depend on objectclass mappings
    (unlike attribute types in LDAP schema, which are indifferent to
    objectclasses). Thus, we have oc_map_id column with link to oc_mappings
    table.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now we cut the SQL query that loads values for a given attribute
    into 3 parts. First goes into sel_expr column - this is the expression we
    had between SELECT and FROM keywords, which defines WHAT to load. Next is
    table list - text between FROM and WHERE keywords. It may contain aliases
    for convenience (see examples). The last is part of the where clause, which
    (if it exists at all) expresses the condition for joining the table
    containing values with the table containing the primary key (foreign key
    equality and such). If values are in the same table as the primary key, then
    this column is left NULL (as for cn attribute above).</p>
<p class="Pp">Having this information in parts, we are able to not only
    construct queries that load attribute values by id of entry (for this we
    could store SQL query as a whole), but to construct queries that load id's
    of objects that correspond to a given search filter (or at least part of
    it). See below for examples.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  ldap_entries
  ------------
  id=1
  dn=&lt;dn you choose&gt;
  oc_map_id=...
  parent=&lt;parent record id&gt;
  keyval=&lt;value of primary key&gt;</pre>
<p class="Pp">This table defines mappings between DNs of entries in your LDAP
    tree, and values of primary keys for corresponding relational data. It has
    recursive structure (parent column references id column of the same table),
    which allows you to add any tree structure(s) to your flat relational data.
    Having id of objectclass mapping, we can determine table and column for
    primary key, and keyval stores value of it, thus defining the exact tuple
    corresponding to the LDAP entry with this DN.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that such design (see exact SQL table creation query) implies
    one important constraint - the key must be an integer. But all that I know
    about well-designed schemas makes me think that it's not very narrow ;) If
    anyone needs support for different types for keys - he may want to write a
    patch, and submit it to OpenLDAP ITS, then I'll include it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also, several users complained that they don't really need very
    structured trees, and they don't want to update one more table every time
    they add or delete an instance in the relational schema. Those people can
    use a view instead of a real table for ldap_entries, something like this (by
    Robin Elfrink):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  CREATE VIEW ldap_entries (id, dn, oc_map_id, parent, keyval)
      AS
          SELECT 0, UPPER('o=MyCompany,c=NL'),
              3, 0, 'baseObject' FROM unixusers WHERE userid='root'
      UNION
          SELECT (1000000000+userid),
              UPPER(CONCAT(CONCAT('cn=',gecos),',o=MyCompany,c=NL')),
              1, 0, userid FROM unixusers
      UNION
          SELECT (2000000000+groupnummer),
              UPPER(CONCAT(CONCAT('cn=',groupnaam),',o=MyCompany,c=NL')),
              2, 0, groupnummer FROM groups;</pre>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">If your RDBMS does not support <b>unions</b> in views, only one
    objectClass can be mapped in <b>ldap_entries</b>, and the baseObject cannot
    be created; in this case, see the <b>baseObject</b> directive for a possible
    workaround.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="TYPICAL_SQL_BACKEND_OPERATION"><a class="permalink" href="#TYPICAL_SQL_BACKEND_OPERATION">TYPICAL
  SQL BACKEND OPERATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Having meta-information loaded, the SQL backend uses these tables
    to determine a set of primary keys of candidates (depending on search scope
    and filter). It tries to do it for each objectclass registered in
    ldap_objclasses.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example: for our query with filter (telephoneNumber=123*) we would
    get the following query generated (which loads candidate IDs)</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  SELECT ldap_entries.id,persons.id, 'person' AS objectClass,
         ldap_entries.dn AS dn
    FROM ldap_entries,persons,phones
   WHERE persons.id=ldap_entries.keyval
     AND ldap_entries.objclass=?
     AND ldap_entries.parent=?
     AND phones.pers_id=persons.id
     AND (phones.phone LIKE '%1%2%3%')</pre>
<p class="Pp">(for ONELEVEL search) or &quot;... AND dn=?&quot; (for BASE
    search) or &quot;... AND dn LIKE '%?'&quot; (for SUBTREE)</p>
<p class="Pp">Then, for each candidate, we load the requested attributes using
    per-attribute queries like</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  SELECT phones.phone AS telephoneNumber
    FROM persons,phones
   WHERE persons.id=? AND phones.pers_id=persons.id</pre>
<p class="Pp">Then, we use test_filter() from the frontend API to test the entry
    for a full LDAP search filter match (since we cannot effectively make sense
    of SYNTAX of corresponding LDAP schema attribute, we translate the filter
    into the most relaxed SQL condition to filter candidates), and send it to
    the user.</p>
<p class="Pp">ADD, DELETE, MODIFY and MODRDN operations are also performed on
    per-attribute meta-information (add_proc etc.). In those fields one can
    specify an SQL statement or stored procedure call which can add, or delete
    given values of a given attribute, using the given entry keyval (see
    examples -- mostly PostgreSQL, ORACLE and MSSQL - since as of this writing
    there are no stored procs in MySQL).</p>
<p class="Pp">We just add more columns to ldap_oc_mappings and
    ldap_attr_mappings, holding statements to execute (like create_proc,
    add_proc, del_proc etc.), and flags governing the order of parameters passed
    to those statements. Please see samples to find out what are the parameters
    passed, and other information on this matter - they are self-explanatory for
    those familiar with the concepts expressed above.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMON_TECHNIQUES"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMON_TECHNIQUES">COMMON
  TECHNIQUES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">First of all, let's recall that among other major differences to
    the complete LDAP data model, the above illustrated concept does not
    directly support such features as multiple objectclasses per entry, and
    referrals. Fortunately, they are easy to adopt in this scheme. The SQL
    backend requires that one more table is added to the schema:
    ldap_entry_objectclasses(entry_id,oc_name).</p>
<p class="Pp">That table contains any number of objectclass names that
    corresponding entries will possess, in addition to that mentioned in
    mapping. The SQL backend automatically adds attribute mapping for the
    &quot;objectclass&quot; attribute to each objectclass mapping that loads
    values from this table. So, you may, for instance, have a mapping for
    inetOrgPerson, and use it for queries for &quot;person&quot;
  objectclass...</p>
<p class="Pp">Referrals used to be implemented in a loose manner by adding an
    extra table that allowed any entry to host a &quot;ref&quot; attribute,
    along with a &quot;referral&quot; extra objectClass in table
    ldap_entry_objclasses. In the current implementation, referrals are treated
    like any other user-defined schema, since &quot;referral&quot; is a
    structural objectclass. The suggested practice is to define a
    &quot;referral&quot; entry in ldap_oc_mappings, holding a naming attribute,
    e.g. &quot;ou&quot; or &quot;cn&quot;, a &quot;ref&quot; attribute,
    containing the url; in case multiple referrals per entry are needed, a
    separate table for urls can be created, where urls are mapped to the
    respective entries. The use of the naming attribute usually requires to add
    an &quot;extensibleObject&quot; value to ldap_entry_objclasses.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="permalink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">As previously stated, this backend should not be considered a
    replacement of other data storage backends, but rather a gateway to existing
    RDBMS storages that need to be published in LDAP form.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>hasSubordintes</b> operational attribute is honored by
    back-sql in search results and in compare operations; it is partially
    honored also in filtering. Owing to design limitations, a (brain-dead?)
    filter of the form <b>(!(hasSubordinates=TRUE))</b> will give no results
    instead of returning all the leaf entries, because it actually expands into
    <b>... AND NOT (1=1)</b>. If you need to find all the leaf entries, please
    use <b>(hasSubordinates=FALSE)</b> instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">A directoryString value of the form &quot;__First___Last_&quot;
    (where underscores mean spaces, ASCII 0x20 char) corresponds to its
    prettified counterpart &quot;First_Last&quot;; this is not currently honored
    by back-sql if non-prettified data is written via RDBMS; when non-prettified
    data is written through back-sql, the prettified values are actually used
    instead.</p>

<p class="Pp">When the <b>ldap_entry_objclasses</b> table is empty, filters on

    workaround consists in adding at least one row to that table, no matter if
    valid or not.</p>
