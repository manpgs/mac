<p class="Pp">The <a class="Xr" href="../4/audit">audit(4)</a> subsystem has
    been deprecated since macOS 11.0, disabled since macOS 14.0, and <b>WILL BE
    REMOVED</b> in a future version of macOS. Applications that require a
    security event stream should use the
    <a class="Xr" href="../7/EndpointSecurity">EndpointSecurity(7)</a> API
    instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">On this version of macOS, you can re-enable
    <a class="Xr" href="../4/audit">audit(4)</a> by renaming or copying
    <span class="Pa">/etc/security/audit_control.example</span> to
    <span class="Pa">/etc/security/audit_control</span>, re-enabling the
    <span class="Pa">system/com.apple.auditd</span> service by running
    <b>launchctl enable system/com.apple.auditd</b> as root, and rebooting.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">audit_class</code> file contains descriptions
    of the auditable event classes on the system. Each auditable event is a
    member of an event class. Each line maps an audit event mask (bitmap) to a
    class and a description. Entries are of the form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd
  Bd-indent"><var class="Ar">classmask</var>:<var class="Ar">eventclass</var>:<var class="Ar">description</var></div>
<p class="Pp">Example entries in this file are:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">

0x00000001:fr:file read

<p class="Pp">The audit class <span class="Pa">res</span> is reserved for
    internal use. Unentitled applications can still modify the event class
    preselection mask for an audit event (for example by using the
    <a class="Xr" href="../5/audit_event">audit_event(5)</a> configuration file
    or the <a class="Xr" href="../2/auditon">auditon(2)</a> system call with the
    A_SETCLASS command), however these applications will not be able to change
    the <span class="Pa">res</span> audit class mask for that event.</p>
