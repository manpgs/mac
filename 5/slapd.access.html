<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>slapd.conf</b>(5) file contains configuration information
    for the <b>slapd</b>(8) daemon. This configuration file is also used by the
    SLAPD tools <b>slapacl</b>(8), <b>slapadd</b>(8), <b>slapauth</b>(8),
    <b>slapcat</b>(8), <b>slapdn</b>(8), <b>slapindex</b>(8), and
    <b>slaptest</b>(8).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>slapd.conf</b> file consists of a series of global
    configuration options that apply to <b>slapd</b> as a whole (including all
    backends), followed by zero or more database backend definitions that
    contain information specific to a backend instance.</p>
<p class="Pp">The general format of <b>slapd.conf</b> is as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    # comment - these options apply to every database
    &lt;global configuration options&gt;
    # first database definition &amp; configuration options
    database    &lt;backend 1 type&gt;
    &lt;configuration options specific to backend 1&gt;
    # subsequent database definitions &amp; configuration options
    ...</pre>
<p class="Pp">Both the global configuration and each backend-specific section
    can contain access information. Backend-specific access control directives
    are used for those entries that belong to the backend, according to their
    naming context. In case no access control directives are defined for a
    backend or those which are defined are not applicable, the directives from
    the global configuration section are then used.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no access controls are present, the default policy allows
    anyone and everyone to read anything but restricts updates to rootdn. (e.g.,
    &quot;access to * by * read&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">When dealing with an access list, because the global access list
    is effectively appended to each per-database list, if the resulting list is
    non-empty then the access list will end with an implicit <b>access to * by *
    none</b> directive. If there are no access directives applicable to a
    backend, then a default read is used.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Be warned: the rootdn can always read and write
  EVERYTHING!</b></p>
<p class="Pp">For entries not held in any backend (such as a root DSE), the
    global directives are used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Arguments that should be replaced by actual text are shown in
    brackets &lt;&gt;.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="THE_ACCESS_DIRECTIVE"><a class="permalink" href="#THE_ACCESS_DIRECTIVE">THE
  ACCESS DIRECTIVE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The structure of the access control directives is</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="access"><a class="permalink" href="#access"><b>access to &lt;what&gt;
    [ by &lt;who&gt; [ &lt;access&gt; ] [ &lt;control&gt; ] ]+</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Grant access (specified by <b>&lt;access&gt;</b>) to a set of entries
      and/or attributes (specified by <b>&lt;what&gt;</b>) by one or more
      requestors (specified by <b>&lt;who&gt;</b>).
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Lists of access directives are evaluated in the order they appear
    in <i>slapd.conf</i>. When a <b>&lt;what&gt;</b> clause matches the datum
    whose access is being evaluated, its <b>&lt;who&gt;</b> clause list is
    checked. When a <b>&lt;who&gt;</b> clause matches the accessor's properties,
    its <b>&lt;access&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;control&gt;</b> clauses are evaluated.
    Access control checking stops at the first match of the <b>&lt;what&gt;</b>
    and <b>&lt;who&gt;</b> clause, unless otherwise dictated by the
    <b>&lt;control&gt;</b> clause. Each <b>&lt;who&gt;</b> clause list is
    implicitly terminated by a</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>	by * none stop</pre>
<p class="Pp">clause that results in stopping the access control with no access
    privileges granted. Each <b>&lt;what&gt;</b> clause list is implicitly
    terminated by a</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>	access to *
		by * none</pre>
<p class="Pp">clause that results in granting no access privileges to an

<h1 class="Sh" id="THE__WHAT__FIELD"><a class="permalink" href="#THE__WHAT__FIELD">THE
  &lt;WHAT&gt; FIELD</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The field <b>&lt;what&gt;</b> specifies the entity the access
    control directive applies to. It can have the forms</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>	dn[.&lt;dnstyle&gt;]=&lt;dnpattern&gt;
	filter=&lt;ldapfilter&gt;
	attrs=&lt;attrlist&gt;[ val[/matchingRule][.&lt;attrstyle&gt;]=&lt;attrval&gt;]</pre>

		|one(level)|sub(tree)|children}
	&lt;attrlist&gt;={&lt;attr&gt;|[{!|@}]&lt;objectClass&gt;}[,&lt;attrlist&gt;]
	&lt;attrstyle&gt;={{exact|base(object)}|regex
		|one(level)|sub(tree)|children}</pre>
<p class="Pp">The statement <b>dn=&lt;dnpattern&gt;</b> selects the entries
    based on their naming context. The <b>&lt;dnpattern&gt;</b> is a string
    representation of the entry's DN. The wildcard <b>*</b> stands for all the
    entries, and it is implied if no <b>dn</b> form is given.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>&lt;dnstyle&gt;</b> is optional; however, it is recommended
    to specify it to avoid ambiguities. <b>Base</b> (synonym of
    <b>baseObject</b>), the default, or <b>exact</b> (an alias of <b>base</b>)
    indicates the entry whose DN is equal to the <b>&lt;dnpattern&gt;</b>;
    <b>one</b> (synonym of <b>onelevel</b>) indicates all the entries
    immediately below the <b>&lt;dnpattern&gt;</b>, <b>sub</b> (synonym of
    <b>subtree</b>) indicates all entries in the subtree at the
    <b>&lt;dnpattern&gt;</b>, <b>children</b> indicates all the entries below
    (subordinate to) the <b>&lt;dnpattern&gt;</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>&lt;dnstyle&gt;</b> qualifier is <b>regex</b>, then
    <b>&lt;dnpattern&gt;</b> is a POSIX (''extended'') regular expression
    pattern, as detailed in <b>regex</b>(7) and/or <b>re_format</b>(7), matching
    a normalized string representation of the entry's DN. The regex form of the
    pattern does not (yet) support UTF-8.</p>
<p class="Pp">The statement <b>filter=&lt;ldapfilter&gt;</b> selects the entries
    based on a valid LDAP filter as described in RFC 4515. A filter of
    <b>(objectClass=*)</b> is implied if no <b>filter</b> form is given.</p>
<p class="Pp">The statement <b>attrs=&lt;attrlist&gt;</b> selects the attributes
    the access control rule applies to. It is a comma-separated list of
    attribute types, plus the special names <b>entry</b>, indicating access to
    the entry itself, and <b>children</b>, indicating access to the entry's
    children. ObjectClass names may also be specified in this list, which will
    affect all the attributes that are required and/or allowed by that
    objectClass. Actually, names in <b>&lt;attrlist&gt;</b> that are prefixed by
    <b>@</b> are directly treated as objectClass names. A name prefixed by
    <b>!</b> is also treated as an objectClass, but in this case the access rule
    affects the attributes that are not required nor allowed by that
    objectClass. If no <b>attrs</b> form is given,
    <b>attrs=@extensibleObject</b> is implied, i.e. all attributes are
    addressed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using the form <b>attrs=&lt;attr&gt;
    val[/matchingRule][.&lt;attrstyle&gt;]=&lt;attrval&gt;</b> specifies access
    to a particular value of a single attribute. In this case, only a single
    attribute type may be given. The <b>&lt;attrstyle&gt;</b> <b>exact</b> (the
    default) uses the attribute's equality matching rule to compare the value,
    unless a different (and compatible) matching rule is specified. If the
    <b>&lt;attrstyle&gt;</b> is <b>regex</b>, the provided value is used as a
    POSIX (''extended'') regular expression pattern. If the attribute has DN
    syntax, the <b>&lt;attrstyle&gt;</b> can be any of <b>base</b>,
    <b>onelevel</b>, <b>subtree</b> or <b>children</b>, resulting in base,
    onelevel, subtree or children match, respectively.</p>
<p class="Pp">The dn, filter, and attrs statements are additive; they can be
    used in sequence to select entities the access rule applies to based on
    naming context, value and attribute type simultaneously. Submatches
    resulting from <b>regex</b> matching can be dereferenced in the
    <b>&lt;who&gt;</b> field using the syntax <i>${v&lt;n&gt;}</i>, where
    <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> is the submatch number. The default syntax,
    <i>$&lt;n&gt;</i>, is actually an alias for <i>${d&lt;n&gt;}</i>, that
    corresponds to dereferencing submatches from the <b>dnpattern</b> portion of
    the <b>&lt;what&gt;</b> field.</p>

<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">The wildcard <b>*</b> refers to everybody.</p>
<p class="Pp">The keywords prefixed by <b>real</b> act as their counterparts
    without prefix; the checking respectively occurs with the
    <i>authentication</i> DN and the <i>authorization</i> DN.</p>
<p class="Pp">The keyword <b>anonymous</b> means access is granted to
    unauthenticated clients; it is mostly used to limit access to authentication
    resources (e.g. the <b>userPassword</b> attribute) to unauthenticated
    clients for authentication purposes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The keyword <b>users</b> means access is granted to authenticated
    clients.</p>
<p class="Pp">The keyword <b>self</b> means access to an entry is allowed to the
    entry itself (e.g. the entry being accessed and the requesting entry must be
    the same). It allows the <b>level{&lt;n&gt;}</b> style, where
    <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> indicates what ancestor of the DN is to be used in matches.
    A positive value indicates that the &lt;n&gt;-th ancestor of the user's DN
    is to be considered; a negative value indicates that the &lt;n&gt;-th
    ancestor of the target is to be considered. For example, a &quot;<i>by
    self.level{1} ...</i>&quot; clause would match when the object
    &quot;<i>dc=example,dc=com</i>&quot; is accessed by
    &quot;<i>cn=User,dc=example,dc=com</i>&quot;. A &quot;<i>by self.level{-1}
    ...</i>&quot; clause would match when the same user accesses the object
    &quot;<i>ou=Address Book,cn=User,dc=example,dc=com</i>&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The statement <b>dn=&lt;DN&gt;</b> means that access is granted to
    the matching DN. The optional style qualifier <b>dnstyle</b> allows the same
    choices of the dn form of the <b>&lt;what&gt;</b> field. In addition, the
    <b>regex</b> style can exploit substring substitution of submatches in the
    <b>&lt;what&gt;</b> dn.regex clause by using the form <b>$&lt;digit&gt;</b>,
    with <b>digit</b> ranging from 0 to 9 (where 0 matches the entire string),
    or the form <b>${&lt;digit&gt;+}</b>, for submatches higher than 9.
    Substring substitution from attribute value can be done in using the form
    <b>${v&lt;digit&gt;+}</b>. Since the dollar character is used to indicate a
    substring replacement, the dollar character that is used to indicate match
    up to the end of the string must be escaped by a second dollar character,
    e.g.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    access to dn.regex=&quot;^(.+,)?uid=([^,]+),dc=[^,]+,dc=com$&quot;
        by dn.regex=&quot;^uid=$2,dc=[^,]+,dc=com$$&quot; write</pre>
<p class="Pp">The style qualifier allows an optional <b>modifier</b>. At
    present, the only type allowed is <b>expand</b>, which causes substring
    substitution of submatches to take place even if <b>dnstyle</b> is not
    <b>regex</b>. Note that the <b>regex</b> dnstyle in the above example may be
    of use only if the <b>&lt;by&gt;</b> clause needs to be a regex; otherwise,
    if the value of the second (from the right) <b>dc=</b> portion of the DN in
    the above example were fixed, the form</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    access to dn.regex=&quot;^(.+,)?uid=([^,]+),dc=example,dc=com$&quot;
        by dn.exact,expand=&quot;uid=$2,dc=example,dc=com&quot; write</pre>
<p class="Pp">could be used; if it had to match the value in the
    <b>&lt;what&gt;</b> clause, the form</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    access to dn.regex=&quot;^(.+,)?uid=([^,]+),dc=([^,]+),dc=com$&quot;
        by dn.exact,expand=&quot;uid=$2,dc=$3,dc=com&quot; write</pre>
<p class="Pp">could be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Forms of the <b>&lt;what&gt;</b> clause other than regex may
    provide submatches as well. The <b>base(object)</b>, the <b>sub(tree)</b>,
    the <b>one(level)</b>, and the <b>children</b> forms provide <b>$0</b> as
    the match of the entire string. The <b>sub(tree)</b>, the <b>one(level)</b>,
    and the <b>children</b> forms also provide <b>$1</b> as the match of the
    rightmost part of the DN as defined in the <b>&lt;what&gt;</b> clause. This
    may be useful, for instance, to provide access to all the ancestors of a
    user by defining</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    access to dn.subtree=&quot;dc=com&quot;
        by dn.subtree,expand=&quot;$1&quot; read</pre>
<p class="Pp">which means that only access to entries that appear in the DN of
    the <b>&lt;by&gt;</b> clause is allowed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>level{&lt;n&gt;}</b> form is an extension and a
    generalization of the <b>onelevel</b> form, which matches all DNs whose
    &lt;n&gt;-th ancestor is the pattern. So, <i>level{1}</i> is equivalent to
    <i>onelevel</i>, and <i>level{0}</i> is equivalent to <i>base</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is perfectly useless to give any access privileges to a DN that
    exactly matches the <b>rootdn</b> of the database the ACLs apply to, because
    it implicitly possesses write privileges for the entire tree of that
    database. Actually, access control is bypassed for the <b>rootdn</b>, to
    solve the intrinsic chicken-and-egg problem.</p>
<p class="Pp">The statement <b>dnattr=&lt;attrname&gt;</b> means that access is
    granted to requests whose DN is listed in the entry being accessed under the
    <b>&lt;attrname&gt;</b> attribute.</p>
<p class="Pp">The statement <b>group=&lt;group&gt;</b> means that access is
    granted to requests whose DN is listed in the group entry whose DN is given
    by <b>&lt;group&gt;</b>. The optional parameters <b>&lt;objectclass&gt;</b>
    and <b>&lt;attrname&gt;</b> define the objectClass and the member
    attributeType of the group entry. The defaults are <b>groupOfNames</b> and
    <b>member</b>, respectively. The optional style qualifier
    <b>&lt;style&gt;</b> can be <b>expand</b>, which means that
    <b>&lt;group&gt;</b> will be expanded as a replacement string (but not as a
    regular expression) according to <b>regex</b>(7) and/or <b>re_format</b>(7),
    and <b>exact</b>, which means that exact match will be used. If the style of
    the DN portion of the <b>&lt;what&gt;</b> clause is regex, the submatches
    are made available according to <b>regex</b>(7) and/or <b>re_format</b>(7);
    other styles provide limited submatches as discussed above about the DN form
    of the <b>&lt;by&gt;</b> clause.</p>
<p class="Pp">For static groups, the specified attributeType must have
    <b>DistinguishedName</b> or <b>NameAndOptionalUID</b> syntax. For dynamic
    groups the attributeType must be a subtype of the <b>labeledURI</b>
    attributeType. Only LDAP URIs of the form
    <b>ldap:///&lt;base&gt;??&lt;scope&gt;?&lt;filter&gt;</b> will be evaluated
    in a dynamic group, by searching the local server only.</p>
<p class="Pp">The statements <b>peername=&lt;peername&gt;</b>,
    <b>sockname=&lt;sockname&gt;</b>, <b>domain=&lt;domain&gt;</b>, and
    <b>sockurl=&lt;sockurl&gt;</b> mean that the contacting host IP (in the form
    <b>IP=&lt;ip&gt;:&lt;port&gt;</b> for IPv4, or
    <b>IP=[&lt;ipv6&gt;]:&lt;port&gt;</b> for IPv6) or the contacting host named
    pipe file name (in the form <b>PATH=&lt;path&gt;</b> if connecting through a
    named pipe) for <b>peername</b>, the named pipe file name for
    <b>sockname</b>, the contacting host name for <b>domain</b>, and the
    contacting URL for <b>sockurl</b> are compared against <b>pattern</b> to
    determine access. The same <b>style</b> rules for pattern match described
    for the <b>group</b> case apply, plus the <b>regex</b> style, which implies
    submatch <b>expand</b> and regex match of the corresponding connection
    parameters. The <b>exact</b> style of the <b>&lt;peername&gt;</b> clause
    (the default) implies a case-exact match on the client's <b>IP</b>,
    including the <b>IP=</b> prefix and the trailing <b>:&lt;port&gt;</b>, or
    the client's <b>path</b>, including the <b>PATH=</b> prefix if connecting
    through a named pipe. The special <b>ip</b> style interprets the pattern as
    <b>&lt;peername&gt;=&lt;ip&gt;[%&lt;mask&gt;][{&lt;n&gt;}]</b>, where
    <b>&lt;ip&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;mask&gt;</b> are dotted digit representations
    of the IP and the mask, while <b>&lt;n&gt;</b>, delimited by curly brackets,
    is an optional port. The same applies to IPv6 addresses when the special
    <b>ipv6</b> style is used. When checking access privileges, the IP portion
    of the <b>peername</b> is extracted, eliminating the <b>IP=</b> prefix and
    the <b>:&lt;port&gt;</b> part, and it is compared against the
    <b>&lt;ip&gt;</b> portion of the pattern after masking with
    <b>&lt;mask&gt;</b>: <i>((peername &amp; &lt;mask&gt;) == &lt;ip&gt;)</i>.
    As an example, <b>peername.ip=127.0.0.1</b> and <b>peername.ipv6=::1</b>
    allow connections only from localhost,
    <b>peername.ip=192.168.1.0%255.255.255.0</b> allows connections from any IP
    in the 192.168.1 class C domain, and
    <b>peername.ip=192.168.1.16%255.255.255.240{9009}</b> allows connections
    from any IP in the 192.168.1.[16-31] range of the same domain, only if port
    9009 is used. The special <b>path</b> style eliminates the <b>PATH=</b>
    prefix from the <b>peername</b> when connecting through a named pipe, and
    performs an exact match on the given pattern. The <b>&lt;domain&gt;</b>
    clause also allows the <b>subtree</b> style, which succeeds when a fully
    qualified name exactly matches the <b>domain</b> pattern, or its trailing
    part, after a <b>dot</b>, exactly matches the <b>domain</b> pattern. The
    <b>expand</b> style is allowed, implying an <b>exact</b> match with submatch
    expansion; the use of <b>expand</b> as a style modifier is considered more
    appropriate. As an example, <b>domain.subtree=example.com</b> will match
    www.example.com, but will not match www.anotherexample.com. The
    <b>domain</b> of the contacting host is determined by performing a DNS
    reverse lookup. As this lookup can easily be spoofed, use of the
    <b>domain</b> statement is strongly discouraged. By default, reverse lookups
    are disabled. The optional <b>domainstyle</b> qualifier of the
    <b>&lt;domain&gt;</b> clause allows a <b>modifier</b> option; the only value
    currently supported is <b>expand</b>, which causes substring substitution of
    submatches to take place even if the <b>domainstyle</b> is not <b>regex</b>,
    much like the analogous usage in <b>&lt;dn&gt;</b> clause.</p>
<p class="Pp">The statement <b>set=&lt;pattern&gt;</b> is undocumented yet.</p>
<p class="Pp">The statement
    <b>dynacl/&lt;name&gt;[/&lt;options&gt;][.&lt;dynstyle&gt;][=&lt;pattern&gt;]</b>
    means that access checking is delegated to the admin-defined method
    indicated by <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>, which can be registered at run-time by
    means of the <b>moduleload</b> statement. The fields <b>&lt;options&gt;</b>,
    <b>&lt;dynstyle&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b> are optional, and are
    directly passed to the registered parsing routine. Dynacl is experimental;
    it must be enabled at compile time.</p>
<p class="Pp">The statement <b>dynacl/aci[=&lt;attrname&gt;]</b> means that the
    access control is determined by the values in the <b>attrname</b> of the
    entry itself. The optional <b>&lt;attrname&gt;</b> indicates what
    attributeType holds the ACI information in the entry. By default, the
    <b>OpenLDAPaci</b> operational attribute is used. ACIs are experimental;
    they must be enabled at compile time.</p>
<p class="Pp">The statements <b>ssf=&lt;n&gt;</b>,
    <b>transport_ssf=&lt;n&gt;</b>, <b>tls_ssf=&lt;n&gt;</b>, and
    <b>sasl_ssf=&lt;n&gt;</b> set the minimum required Security Strength Factor
    (ssf) needed to grant access. The value should be positive integer.</p>

<p class="Pp">The optional field <b>&lt;access&gt; ::=
    [[real]self]{&lt;level&gt;|&lt;priv&gt;}</b> determines the access level or
    the specific access privileges the <b>who</b> field will have. Its component
    are defined as</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>	&lt;level&gt; ::= none|disclose|auth|compare|search|read|{write|add|delete}|manage
	&lt;priv&gt; ::= {=|+|-}{0|d|x|c|s|r|{w|a|z}|m}+</pre>
<p class="Pp">The modifier <b>self</b> allows special operations like having a
    certain access level or privilege only in case the operation involves the
    name of the user that's requesting the access. It implies the user that
    requests access is authorized. The modifier <b>realself</b> refers to the
    authenticated DN as opposed to the authorized DN of the <b>self</b>
    modifier. An example is the <b>selfwrite</b> access to the member attribute
    of a group, which allows one to add/delete its own DN from the member list
    of a group, while being not allowed to affect other members.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>level</b> access model relies on an incremental
    interpretation of the access privileges. The possible levels are
    <b>none</b>, <b>disclose</b>, <b>auth</b>, <b>compare</b>, <b>search</b>,
    <b>read</b>, <b>write</b>, and <b>manage</b>. Each access level implies all
    the preceding ones, thus <b>manage</b> grants all access including
    administrative access. The <b>write</b> access is actually the combination
    of <b>add</b> and <b>delete</b>, which respectively restrict the write
    privilege to add or delete the specified <b>&lt;what&gt;</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>none</b> access level disallows all access including
    disclosure on error.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>disclose</b> access level allows disclosure of information
    on error.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>auth</b> access level means that one is allowed access to
    an attribute to perform authentication/authorization operations (e.g.
    <b>bind</b>) with no other access. This is useful to grant unauthenticated
    clients the least possible access level to critical resources, like
    passwords.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>priv</b> access model relies on the explicit setting of
    access privileges for each clause. The <b>=</b> sign resets previously
    defined accesses; as a consequence, the final access privileges will be only
    those defined by the clause. The <b>+</b> and <b>-</b> signs add/remove
    access privileges to the existing ones. The privileges are <b>m</b> for
    manage, <b>w</b> for write, <b>a</b> for add, <b>z</b> for delete, <b>r</b>
    for read, <b>s</b> for search, <b>c</b> for compare, <b>x</b> for
    authentication, and <b>d</b> for disclose. More than one of the above
    privileges can be added in one statement. <b>0</b> indicates no privileges
    and is used only by itself (e.g., +0). Note that <b>+az</b> is equivalent to
    <b>+w</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no access is given, it defaults to <b>+0</b>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="THE__CONTROL__FIELD"><a class="permalink" href="#THE__CONTROL__FIELD">THE
  &lt;CONTROL&gt; FIELD</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The optional field <b>&lt;control&gt;</b> controls the flow of
    access rule application. It can have the forms</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>	stop
	continue
	break</pre>
<p class="Pp">where <b>stop</b>, the default, means access checking stops in
    case of match. The other two forms are used to keep on processing access
    clauses. In detail, the <b>continue</b> form allows for other
    <b>&lt;who&gt;</b> clauses in the same <b>&lt;access&gt;</b> clause to be
    considered, so that they may result in incrementally altering the
    privileges, while the <b>break</b> form allows for other
    <b>&lt;access&gt;</b> clauses that match the same target to be processed.
    Consider the (silly) example</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>	access to dn.subtree=&quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot; attrs=cn
		by * =cs break
	access to dn.subtree=&quot;ou=People,dc=example,dc=com&quot;
		by * +r</pre>
<p class="Pp">which allows search and compare privileges to everybody under the
    &quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot; tree, with the second rule allowing also read
    in the &quot;ou=People&quot; subtree, or the (even more silly) example</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>	access to dn.subtree=&quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot; attrs=cn
		by * =cs continue
		by users +r</pre>
<p class="Pp">which grants everybody search and compare privileges, and adds
    read privileges to authenticated clients.</p>
<p class="Pp">One useful application is to easily grant write privileges to an
    <b>updatedn</b> that is different from the <b>rootdn</b>. In this case,
    since the <b>updatedn</b> needs write access to (almost) all data, one can
    use</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>	access to *
		by dn.exact=&quot;cn=The Update DN,dc=example,dc=com&quot; write
		by * break</pre>
<p class="Pp">as the first access rule. As a consequence, unless the operation
    is performed with the <b>updatedn</b> identity, control is passed straight
    to the subsequent rules.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPERATION_REQUIREMENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPERATION_REQUIREMENTS">OPERATION
  REQUIREMENTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Operations require different privileges on different portions of
    entries. The following summary applies to primary database backends such as
    the BDB and HDB backends. Requirements for other backends may (and often do)
    differ.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>add</b> operation requires <b>add (=a)</b> privileges on
    the pseudo-attribute <b>entry</b> of the entry being added, and <b>add
    (=a)</b> privileges on the pseudo-attribute <b>children</b> of the entry's
    parent. When adding the suffix entry of a database, <b>add</b> access to
    <b>children</b> of the empty DN (&quot;&quot;) is required. Also if Add
    content ACL checking has been configured on the database (see the
    <b>slapd.conf</b>(5) or <b>slapd-config</b>(5) manual page), <b>add (=a)</b>
    will be required on all of the attributes being added.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>bind</b> operation, when credentials are stored in the
    directory, requires <b>auth (=x)</b> privileges on the attribute the
    credentials are stored in (usually <b>userPassword</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>compare</b> operation requires <b>compare (=c)</b>
    privileges on the attribute that is being compared.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>delete</b> operation requires <b>delete (=z)</b> privileges
    on the pseudo-attribute <b>entry</b> of the entry being deleted, and
    <b>delete (=d)</b> privileges on the <b>children</b> pseudo-attribute of the
    entry's parent.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>modify</b> operation requires <b>write (=w)</b> privileges
    on the attributes being modified. In detail, <b>add (=a)</b> is required to
    add new values, <b>delete (=z)</b> is required to delete existing values,
    and both <b>delete</b> and <b>add (=az)</b>, or <b>write (=w)</b>, are
    required to replace existing values.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>modrdn</b> operation requires <b>write (=w)</b> privileges
    on the pseudo-attribute <b>entry</b> of the entry whose relative DN is being
    modified, <b>delete (=z)</b> privileges on the pseudo-attribute
    <b>children</b> of the old entry's parents, <b>add (=a)</b> privileges on
    the pseudo-attribute <b>children</b> of the new entry's parents, and <b>add
    (=a)</b> privileges on the attributes that are present in the new relative
    DN. <b>Delete (=z)</b> privileges are also required on the attributes that
    are present in the old relative DN if <b>deleteoldrdn</b> is set to 1.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>search</b> operation, requires <b>search (=s)</b>
    privileges on the <b>entry</b> pseudo-attribute of the searchBase (NOTE:
    this was introduced with OpenLDAP 2.4). Then, for each entry, it requires
    <b>search (=s)</b> privileges on the attributes that are defined in the
    filter. The resulting entries are finally tested for <b>read (=r)</b>
    privileges on the pseudo-attribute <b>entry</b> (for read access to the
    entry itself) and for <b>read (=r)</b> access on each value of each
    attribute that is requested. Also, for each <b>referral</b> object used in
    generating continuation references, the operation requires <b>read (=r)</b>
    access on the pseudo-attribute <b>entry</b> (for read access to the referral
    object itself), as well as <b>read (=r)</b> access to the attribute holding
    the referral information (generally the <b>ref</b> attribute).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Some internal operations and some <b>controls</b> require specific
    access privileges. The <b>authzID</b> mapping and the <b>proxyAuthz</b>
    control require <b>auth (=x)</b> privileges on all the attributes that are
    present in the search filter of the URI regexp maps (the right-hand side of
    the <b>authz-regexp</b> directives). <b>Auth (=x)</b> privileges are also
    required on the <b>authzTo</b> attribute of the authorizing identity and/or
    on the <b>authzFrom</b> attribute of the authorized identity. In general,
    when an internal lookup is performed for authentication or authorization
    purposes, search-specific privileges (see the access requirements for the
    search operation illustrated above) are relaxed to <b>auth</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Access control to search entries is checked by the frontend, so it
    is fully honored by all backends; for all other operations and for the
    discovery phase of the search operation, full ACL semantics is only
    supported by the primary backends, i.e. <b>back-bdb</b>(5), and
    <b>back-hdb</b>(5).</p>
<p class="Pp">Some other backend, like <b>back-sql</b>(5), may fully support
    them; others may only support a portion of the described semantics, or even
    differ in some aspects. The relevant details are described in the
    backend-specific man pages.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="permalink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">It is strongly recommended to explicitly use the most appropriate
    <b>&lt;dnstyle&gt;</b> in <b>&lt;what&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;who&gt;</b>
    clauses, to avoid possible incorrect specifications of the access rules as
    well as for performance (avoid unnecessary regex matching when an exact
    match suffices) reasons.</p>
<p class="Pp">An administrator might create a rule of the form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>	access to dn.regex=&quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot;
		by ...</pre>
<p class="Pp">expecting it to match all entries in the subtree
    &quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot;. However, this rule actually matches any DN
    which contains anywhere the substring &quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot;. That
    is, the rule matches both &quot;uid=joe,dc=example,dc=com&quot; and
    &quot;dc=example,dc=com,uid=joe&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">To match the desired subtree, the rule would be more precisely
    written:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>	access to dn.regex=&quot;^(.+,)?dc=example,dc=com$&quot;
		by ...</pre>
<p class="Pp">For performance reasons, it would be better to use the subtree
    style.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>	access to dn.subtree=&quot;dc=example,dc=com&quot;
		by ...</pre>
<p class="Pp">When writing submatch rules, it may be convenient to avoid
    unnecessary <b>regex</b> <b>&lt;dnstyle&gt;</b> use; for instance, to allow
    access to the subtree of the user that matches the <b>&lt;what&gt;</b>
    clause, one could use</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>	access to dn.regex=&quot;^(.+,)?uid=([^,]+),dc=example,dc=com$&quot;
		by dn.regex=&quot;^uid=$2,dc=example,dc=com$$&quot; write
		by ...</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, since all that is required in the <b>&lt;by&gt;</b>
    clause is substring expansion, a more efficient solution is</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>	access to dn.regex=&quot;^(.+,)?uid=([^,]+),dc=example,dc=com$&quot;
		by dn.exact,expand=&quot;uid=$2,dc=example,dc=com&quot; write
		by ...</pre>
<p class="Pp">In fact, while a <b>&lt;dnstyle&gt;</b> of <b>regex</b> implies
    substring expansion, <b>exact</b>, as well as all the other DN specific
    <b>&lt;dnstyle&gt;</b> values, does not, so it must be explicitly
  requested.</p>
