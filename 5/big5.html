<p class="Pp">&#x201C;Big Five&#x201D; is the de facto standard for encoding
    Traditional Chinese text. Each character is represented by either one or two
    bytes. Characters from the ASCII character set are represented as single
    bytes in the range 0x00 - 0x7F. Traditional Chinese characters are
    represented by two bytes: the first in the range 0xA1 - 0xFE, the second in
    the range 0x40 - 0xFE.</p>
