<p class="Pp">The <a class="Xr" href="../4/audit">audit(4)</a> subsystem has
    been deprecated since macOS 11.0, disabled since macOS 14.0, and <b>WILL BE
    REMOVED</b> in a future version of macOS. Applications that require a
    security event stream should use the
    <a class="Xr" href="../7/EndpointSecurity">EndpointSecurity(7)</a> API
    instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">On this version of macOS, you can re-enable
    <a class="Xr" href="../4/audit">audit(4)</a> by renaming or copying
    <span class="Pa">/etc/security/audit_control.example</span> to
    <span class="Pa">/etc/security/audit_control</span>, re-enabling the
    <span class="Pa">system/com.apple.auditd</span> service by running
    <b>launchctl enable system/com.apple.auditd</b> as root, and rebooting.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">audit_user</code> file specifies which audit
    event classes are to be audited for the given users. If specified, these
    flags are combined with the system-wide audit flags in the
    <a class="Xr" href="../5/audit_control">audit_control(5)</a> file to
    determine which classes of events to audit for that user. These settings
    take effect when the user logs in.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each line maps a user name to a list of classes that should be
    audited and a list of classes that should not be audited. Entries are of the
    form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd
  Bd-indent"><var class="Ar">username</var>:<var class="Ar">alwaysaudit</var>:<var class="Ar">neveraudit</var></div>
<p class="Pp">In the format above, <var class="Ar">alwaysaudit</var> is a set of
    event classes that are always audited, and <var class="Ar">neveraudit</var>
    is a set of event classes that should not be audited. These sets can
    indicate the inclusion or exclusion of multiple classes, and whether to
    audit successful or failed events. See
    <a class="Xr" href="../5/audit_control">audit_control(5)</a> for more
    information about audit flags.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example entries in this file are:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>root:lo,ad:no
jdoe:-fc,ad:+fw</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">These settings would cause login/logout and administrative events
    that are performed on behalf of user
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">root</code>&#x201D; to be audited. No failure
    events are audited. For the user
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">jdoe</code>&#x201D;, failed file creation events
    are audited, administrative events are audited, and successful file write
    events are never audited.</p>

  NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Per-user and global audit preselection configuration are evaluated
    at time of login, so users must log out and back in again for audit changes
    relating to preselection to take effect.</p>
<p class="Pp">Audit record preselection occurs with respect to the audit
    identifier associated with a process, rather than with respect to the UNIX
    user or group ID. The audit identifier is set as part of the user credential
    context as part of login, and typically does not change as a result of
    running setuid or setgid applications, such as
    <a class="Xr" href="../1/su">su(1)</a>. This has the advantage that events
    that occur after running <a class="Xr" href="../1/su">su(1)</a> can be
    audited to the original authenticated user, as required by CAPP, but may be
    surprising if not expected.</p>
