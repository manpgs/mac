<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">exports</code> file specifies remote mount
    points for the NFS mount protocol per the NFS server specification; see
    <span class="RsT">Network File System Protocol Specification RFC 1094,
    Appendix A</span> and <span class="RsT">NFS: Network File System Version 3
    Specification, Appendix I.</span></p>
<p class="Pp">Fields are separated by space or tab characters. Lines that begin
    with a # are considered comments and are ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each line in the file specifies one or more exported directories,
    any additional mountable sub-directories within those directories, export
    flags, and one or more hosts (if access to the export is to be restricted).
    All directories on the line must exist within the same local file
  system.</p>
<p class="Pp">Within a file system there may be several exported sub-directories
    with different export options. However, none of those exported directories
    may lie within another.</p>
<p class="Pp">A host may be specified only once for each exported directory and
    there may be only one default entry for each exported directory that applies
    to all other hosts. The latter exports the file system to the ``world'' and
    should be used only when the file system contains public information. Any
    attempt to export the same directory to a host with different export options
    will cause the conflicting export entry to be rejected.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first field(s) of an export entry is a list of directories on
    a local file system to export. At least one pathname must be to an exported
    directory. Other pathnames may refer to sub-directories of the exported
    directory to indicate that hosts are also allowed to explicitly mount those
    sub-directories of the exported directory. (Note that the
    <code class="Fl">-alldirs</code> flag can be used to allow mounting any
    sub-directories of the pathnames specified.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Mount points for a file system may appear on multiple lines, each
    with different sets of hosts and export options.</p>
<p class="Pp">The pathnames must not have any symbolic links in them and should
    not have any &quot;.&quot; or &quot;..&quot; components. Single and double
    quote characters occuring in a pathname must be escaped with \' and \&quot;,
    respectively. Space characters occuring in a pathname must be escaped, or
    alternatively, the pathname can be enclosed in single or double quotes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that because an export entry only lists a set of pathnames,
    it is up to the NFS server to correctly determine what file system is meant
    to be exported by that entry. To that end, the server will attempt to
    intelligently decide which file system best matches the entry by comparing
    all the pathnames with both the current list of mounted file systems and the
    list of previously-exported file systems. If the server determines that the
    intended file system is not available, it will automatically mark that
    export as offline until the file system becomes available (see the
    <code class="Fl">-offline</code> export option below for more info). To
    avoid any ambiguity, use of the <code class="Fl">-fs</code> export option is
    recommended (see below).</p>
<p class="Pp">The second component of a line specifies how the file system is to
    be exported to the host set. The option flags specify whether the file
    system is exported read-only or read-write and how the client uid is mapped
    to user credentials on the server.</p>
<p class="Pp">Export options are specified as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Fl">-maproot</code><span class="No">=</span><b class="Sy">user</b>
    The credential of the specified user is used for remote access by root. The
    credential includes all the groups to which the user is a member on the
    local machine ( see <a class="Xr" href="../1/id">id(1)</a> ). The user may
    be specified by name or number.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Fl">-maproot</code><span class="No">=</span><b class="Sy">user:group1:group2:...</b>
    The colon separated list is used to specify the precise credential to be
    used for remote access by root. The elements of the list may be either names
    or numbers. Note that ``user:'' should be used to distinguish a credential
    containing no groups from a complete credential for that user.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Fl">-mapall</code><span class="No">=</span><b class="Sy">user</b>
    or
    <code class="Fl">-mapall</code><span class="No">=</span><b class="Sy">user:group1:group2:...</b>
    specifies a mapping for all client uids (including root) using the same
    semantics as <code class="Fl">-maproot</code>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The option <code class="Fl">-r</code> is a synonym for
    <code class="Fl">-maproot</code> in an effort to be backward compatible with
    older export file formats.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the absence of <code class="Fl">-maproot</code> and
    <code class="Fl">-mapall</code> options, remote accesses by root will result
    in using a credential of -2:-2. All other users will be mapped to their
    remote credential. If a <code class="Fl">-maproot</code> option is given,
    remote access by root will be mapped to that credential instead of -2:-2. If
    a <code class="Fl">-mapall</code> option is given, all users (including
    root) will be mapped to that credential in place of their own.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fl">-alldirs</code> flag allows the host(s) to
    mount at any point within the file system, including regular files if the
    <code class="Fl">-R</code> option is used on nfsd.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fl">-ro</code> option specifies that the file
    system should be exported read-only (default read/write). The option
    <code class="Fl">-o</code> is a synonym for <code class="Fl">-ro</code> in
    an effort to be backward compatible with older export file formats.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fl">-32bitclients</code> option causes the NFS
    server to guarantee that directory cookies will fit within 32 bits even
    though directory cookies are 64 bits in NFSv3. This option may be required
    with NFS clients that do not properly support 64 bit directory cookies. Use
    of this option may result in sub-optimal performance of the exported file
    system.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fl">-manglednames</code> option causes the NFS
    server to guarantee that filenames will fit into 255 bytes. For NFSv2 this
    is always the case. For NFSv3 specifying this option on an export will cause
    filenames greater than 255 characters from that export be mangled in such a
    way that when the client presents a received mangled name it will refer to
    the same name as the original name on the server.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="mechanism1:mechanism2..."><code class="Fl">-sec</code><span class="No">=</span><a class="permalink" href="#mechanism1:mechanism2..."><b class="Sy">mechanism1:mechanism2...</b></a>
    This option specifies one or more security mechanisms required for access to
    the exported directory. The security mechanisms currently supported are
    krb5p, krb5i, krb5, and sys. Multiple security mechanisms can be specified
    as a colon separated list, and should be in the order of most preferred to
    least preferred. In the absence of this option, the security mechanism
    defaults to sys.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Fl">-offline</code> This option specifies that the
    given export should be treated as if the exported file system is not
    available. For NFSv3, this will cause clients to receive &quot;jukebox&quot;
    errors directing them to try the request later. For NFSv2 (which does not
    support this error value), the export will be treated as non-existent and
    clients will receive stale file handle errors.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="/Volumes/XRAID"><code class="Fl">-fspath</code><span class="No">=</span><b class="Sy">/path</b>
    and/or
    <code class="Fl">-fsuuid</code><span class="No">=</span><b class="Sy">UUID</b>
    These options can be used to specify the pathname to and/or the UUID of the
    file system that is intended to be exported. This can be useful to
    disambiguate the export entry. Since the export syntax only specifies the
    path to the directory to be exported, it can be ambiguous as to what file
    system is expected to be exported. Specifying &quot;/Volumes/XRAID&quot; can
    be interpreted as exporting either a file system mounted on that directory
    or the &quot;Volumes/XRAID&quot; subdirectory of the root file system.
    Specifying
    <code class="Fl">-fspath</code><span class="No">=</span><a class="permalink" href="#/Volumes/XRAID"><b class="Sy">/Volumes/XRAID</b></a>
    can prevent exporting the wrong file system - for example, if the exports
    are evaluated at a point when the directory exists but the volume has not
    yet been mounted on it. The export will fail if the file system referred to
    in an export entry either (1) is not mounted at the same path as the given
    <code class="Fl">-fspath</code><span class="No">=</span><b class="Sy">/path</b>.
    or (2) does not have a UUID that matches the given
    <code class="Fl">-fsuuid</code><span class="No">=</span><b class="Sy">UUID</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third component of a line specifies the host set to which the
    line applies. The set may be specified in three ways. The first way is to
    list the host name(s) separated by white space. (Standard internet IPv4
    ``dot'' addresses or IPv6 colon addresses may be used in place of names.)
    The second way is to specify a ``netgroup'' as defined in the netgroup file
    (see <a class="Xr" href="../5/netgroup">netgroup(5)</a> ). The third way is
    to specify an internet sub-network using a network and network mask that is
    defined as the set of all hosts with addresses within the sub-network. This
    latter approach requires less overhead within the kernel and is recommended
    for cases where the export line refers to a large number of clients within
    an administrative sub-net.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="netname">The first two cases are specified by simply listing
    the name(s) separated by whitespace. All names are checked to see if they
    are ``netgroup'' names first and are assumed to be hostnames otherwise.
    Using the full domain specification for a hostname can normally circumvent
    the problem of a host that has the same name as a netgroup. The third case
    is specified by the flag
    <code class="Fl">-network</code><span class="No">=</span><a class="permalink" href="#netname"><b class="Sy">netname</b></a>
    and optionally
    <code class="Fl">-mask</code><span class="No">=</span><a class="permalink" href="#netmask"><b class="Sy" id="netmask">netmask</b></a>.
    If the mask is not specified, it will default to the mask for that network
    class (A, B or C; see <a class="Xr" href="../5/inet">inet(5)</a> ).</p>
