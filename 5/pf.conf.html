<h1 class="Sh" id="TABLES"><a class="permalink" href="#TABLES">TABLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Tables are named structures which can hold a collection of
    addresses and networks. Lookups against tables in packet filter are
    relatively fast, making a single rule with tables much more efficient, in
    terms of processor usage and memory consumption, than a large number of
    rules which differ only in IP address (either created explicitly or
    automatically by rule expansion).</p>
<p class="Pp">Tables can be used as the source or destination of filter rules,
    <var class="Ar">scrub</var> rules or translation rules such as
    <var class="Ar">nat</var> or <var class="Ar">rdr</var> (see below for
    details on the various rule types). Tables can also be used for the redirect
    address of <var class="Ar">nat</var> and <var class="Ar">rdr</var> rules and
    in the routing options of filter rules, but only for
    <var class="Ar">round-robin</var> pools.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tables can be defined with any of the following
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/pfctl">pfctl(8)</a> mechanisms. As with macros,
    reserved words may not be used as table names.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><var class="Ar">manually</var></dt>
  <dd>Persistent tables can be manually created with the
      <var class="Ar">add</var> or <var class="Ar">replace</var> option of
      <a class="Xr" href="../8/pfctl">pfctl(8)</a>, before or after the ruleset
      has been loaded.</dd>
  <dt><span class="Pa">pf.conf</span></dt>
  <dd>Table definitions can be placed directly in this file, and loaded at the
      same time as other rules are loaded, atomically. Table definitions inside
      <code class="Nm">pf.conf</code> use the <var class="Ar">table</var>
      statement, and are especially useful to define non-persistent tables. The
      contents of a pre-existing table defined without a list of addresses to
      initialize it is not altered when <code class="Nm">pf.conf</code> is
      loaded. A table initialized with the empty list, <code class="Li">{
      }</code>, will be cleared on load.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Tables may be defined with the following two attributes:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><var class="Ar">persist</var></dt>
  <dd>The <var class="Ar">persist</var> flag forces the kernel to keep the table
      even when no rules refer to it. If the flag is not set, the kernel will
      automatically remove the table when the last rule referring to it is
      flushed.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">const</var></dt>
  <dd>The <var class="Ar">const</var> flag prevents the user from altering the
      contents of the table once it has been created. Without that flag,
      <a class="Xr" href="../8/pfctl">pfctl(8)</a> can be used to add or remove
      addresses from the table at any time, even when running with
      <a class="Xr" href="../7/securelevel">securelevel(7)</a> = 2.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">For example,</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>table &lt;private&gt; const { 10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16 }
table &lt;badhosts&gt; persist
block on fxp0 from { &lt;private&gt;, &lt;badhosts&gt; } to any</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">creates a table called private, to hold RFC 1918 private network
    blocks, and a table called badhosts, which is initially empty. A filter rule
    is set up to block all traffic coming from addresses listed in either table.
    The private table cannot have its contents changed and the badhosts table
    will exist even when no active filter rules reference it. Addresses may
    later be added to the badhosts table, so that traffic from these hosts can
    be blocked by using</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre># pfctl -t badhosts -Tadd 204.92.77.111</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">A table can also be initialized with an address list specified in
    one or more external files, using the following syntax:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>table &lt;spam&gt; persist file &quot;/etc/spammers&quot; file &quot;/etc/openrelays&quot;
block on fxp0 from &lt;spam&gt; to any</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp" id="all">The files <span class="Pa">/etc/spammers</span> and
    <span class="Pa">/etc/openrelays</span> list IP addresses, one per line. Any
    lines beginning with a # are treated as comments and ignored. In addition to
    being specified by IP address, hosts may also be specified by their
    hostname. When the resolver is called to add a hostname to a table,
    <a class="permalink" href="#all"><i class="Em">all</i></a> resulting IPv4
    and IPv6 addresses are placed into the table. IP addresses can also be
    entered in a table by specifying a valid interface name, a valid interface
    group or the
    <a class="permalink" href="#self"><i class="Em" id="self">self</i></a>
    keyword, in which case all addresses assigned to the interface(s) will be
    added to the table.</p>

<p class="Pp">Packet filter may be tuned for various situations using the

        <var class="Ar">proto.modifier</var> which corresponds to the connection
        state. Each packet which matches this state will reset the TTL. Tuning
        these values may improve the performance of the firewall at the risk of
        dropping valid idle connections.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <dl class="Bl-tag Bl-compact">

      <dd>The state after both FINs have been exchanged and the connection is

    <p class="Pp">ICMP and UDP are handled in a fashion similar to TCP, but with

      <dd>The state after an ICMP error came back in response to an ICMP

    <p class="Pp">Timeout values can be reduced adaptively as the number of

    <dl class="Bl-tag Bl-compact">
      <dt><var class="Ar">adaptive.start</var></dt>
      <dd>When the number of state entries exceeds this value, adaptive scaling
          begins. All timeout values are scaled linearly with factor

      <dt><var class="Ar">adaptive.end</var></dt>
      <dd>When reaching this number of state entries, all timeout values become
          zero, effectively purging all state entries immediately. This value is

          (set a lower state limit, see below).</dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="Pp">Adaptive timeouts are enabled by default, with an
        adaptive.start value equal to 60% of the state limit, and an
        adaptive.end value equal to 120% of the state limit. They can be
        disabled by setting both adaptive.start and adaptive.end to 0.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The adaptive timeout values can be defined both globally and
        for each rule. When used on a per-rule basis, the values relate to the
        number of states created by the rule, otherwise to the total number of
        states.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example:</p>
    <div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">

set timeout { adaptive.start 6000, adaptive.end 12000 }
set limit states 10000</pre>
    </div>
    <p class="Pp">With 9000 state table entries, the timeout values are scaled

    <div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
    <pre>set limit states 20000</pre>
    </div>
    <p class="Pp">sets the maximum number of entries in the memory pool used by

    </dl>
    <p class="Pp">It is important to note that the ruleset optimizer will modify
        the ruleset to improve performance. A side effect of the ruleset
        modification is that per-rule accounting statistics will have different
        meanings than before. If per-rule accounting is important for billing
        purposes or whatnot, either the ruleset optimizer should not be used or
        a label field should be added to all of the accounting rules to act as
        optimization barriers.</p>

  NORMALIZATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Traffic normalization is used to sanitize packet content in such a
    way that there are no ambiguities in packet interpretation on the receiving
    side. The normalizer does IP fragment reassembly to prevent attacks that
    confuse intrusion detection systems by sending overlapping IP fragments.
    Packet normalization is invoked with the <var class="Ar">scrub</var>
    directive.</p>
<p class="Pp"><var class="Ar">scrub</var> has the following options:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>Clears the <var class="Ar">dont-fragment</var> bit from a matching IP
      packet. Some operating systems are known to generate fragmented packets
      with the <var class="Ar">dont-fragment</var> bit set. This is particularly
      true with NFS. <var class="Ar">Scrub</var> will drop such fragmented
      <var class="Ar">dont-fragment</var> packets unless
      <var class="Ar">no-df</var> is specified.
    <p class="Pp">Unfortunately some operating systems also generate their
        <var class="Ar">dont-fragment</var> packets with a zero IP
        identification field. Clearing the <var class="Ar">dont-fragment</var>
        bit on packets with a zero IP ID may cause deleterious results if an
        upstream router later fragments the packet. Using the
        <var class="Ar">random-id</var> modifier (see below) is recommended in
        combination with the <var class="Ar">no-df</var> modifier to ensure
        unique IP identifiers.</p>

  <dd>Replaces the IP identification field with random values to compensate for

    reassembly.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">fragment reassemble</var></dt>
  <dd>Using <var class="Ar">scrub</var> rules, fragments can be reassembled by
      normalization. In this case, fragments are buffered until they form a
      complete packet, and only the completed packet is passed on to the filter.
      The advantage is that filter rules have to deal only with complete
      packets, and can ignore fragments. The drawback of caching fragments is
      the additional memory cost. But the full reassembly method is the only
      method that currently works with NAT. This is the default behavior of a
      <var class="Ar">scrub</var> rule if no fragmentation modifier is
    supplied.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">fragment crop</var></dt>
  <dd>The default fragment reassembly method is expensive, hence the option to
      crop is provided. In this case, packet filter will track the fragments and
      cache a small range descriptor. Duplicate fragments are dropped and
      overlaps are cropped. Thus data will only occur once on the wire with
      ambiguities resolving to the first occurrence. Unlike the
      <var class="Ar">fragment reassemble</var> modifier, fragments are not
      buffered, they are passed as soon as they are received. The
      <var class="Ar">fragment crop</var> reassembly mechanism does not yet work
      with NAT.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">fragment drop-ovl</var></dt>
  <dd>This option is similar to the <var class="Ar">fragment crop</var> modifier

    <dl class="Bl-tag Bl-compact">
      <dt>ttl</dt>
      <dd>Neither side of the connection is allowed to reduce their IP TTL. An
          attacker may send a packet such that it reaches the firewall, affects
          the firewall state, and expires before reaching the destination host.
          <var class="Ar">reassemble tcp</var> will raise the TTL of all packets
          back up to the highest value seen on the connection.</dd>
      <dt>timestamp modulation</dt>
      <dd>Modern TCP stacks will send a timestamp on every TCP packet and echo
          the other endpoint's timestamp back to them. Many operating systems
          will merely start the timestamp at zero when first booted, and
          increment it several times a second. The uptime of the host can be
          deduced by reading the timestamp and multiplying by a constant. Also
          observing several different timestamps can be used to count hosts
          behind a NAT device. And spoofing TCP packets into a connection
          requires knowing or guessing valid timestamps. Timestamps merely need
          to be monotonically increasing and not derived off a guessable base
          time. <var class="Ar">reassemble tcp</var> will cause
          <var class="Ar">scrub</var> to modulate the TCP timestamps with a
          random number.</dd>
      <dt>extended PAWS checks</dt>
      <dd>There is a problem with TCP on long fat pipes, in that a packet might
          get delayed for longer than it takes the connection to wrap its 32-bit
          sequence space. In such an occurrence, the old packet would be
          indistinguishable from a new packet and would be accepted as such. The
          solution to this is called PAWS: Protection Against Wrapped Sequence
          numbers. It protects against it by making sure the timestamp on each
          packet does not go backwards. <var class="Ar">reassemble tcp</var>
          also makes sure the timestamp on the packet does not go forward more
          than the RFC allows. By doing this, packet filter artificially extends
          the security of TCP sequence numbers by 10 to 18 bits when the host
          uses appropriately randomized timestamps, since a blind attacker would
          have to guess the timestamp as well.</dd>

    automatically passed if the <var class="Ar">pass</var> modifier is given,
    otherwise they are still subject to <var class="Ar">block</var> and
    <var class="Ar">pass</var> rules.</p>
<p class="Pp">The state entry created permits packet filter to keep track of the
    original address for traffic associated with that state and correctly direct
    return traffic for that connection.</p>
<p class="Pp">Various types of translation are possible with pf:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><var class="Ar">binat</var></dt>
  <dd>A <var class="Ar">binat</var> rule specifies a bidirectional mapping
      between an external IP netblock and an internal IP netblock.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">nat</var></dt>
  <dd>A <var class="Ar">nat</var> rule specifies that IP addresses are to be
      changed as the packet traverses the given interface. This technique allows
      one or more IP addresses on the translating host to support network
      traffic for a larger range of machines on an &quot;inside&quot; network.
      Although in theory any IP address can be used on the inside, it is
      strongly recommended that one of the address ranges defined by RFC 1918 be
      used. These netblocks are:
    <div class="Bd Pp Li">
    <pre>10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (all of net 10, i.e., 10/8)
172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (i.e., 172.16/12)
192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (i.e., 192.168/16)</pre>
    </div>
  </dd>
  <dt><span class="Pa">rdr</span></dt>
  <dd>The packet is redirected to another destination and possibly a different
      port. <var class="Ar">rdr</var> rules can optionally specify port ranges
      instead of single ports. rdr ... port 2000:2999 -&gt; ... port 4000
      redirects ports 2000 to 2999 (inclusive) to port 4000. rdr ... port
      2000:2999 -&gt; ... port 4000:* redirects port 2000 to 4000, 2001 to 4001,
      ..., 2999 to 4999.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In addition to modifying the address, some translation rules may
    modify source or destination ports for
    <a class="Xr" href="../4/tcp">tcp(4)</a> or
    <a class="Xr" href="../4/udp">udp(4)</a> connections; implicitly in the case
    of <var class="Ar">nat</var> rules and explicitly in the case of
    <var class="Ar">rdr</var> rules. Port numbers are never translated with a
    <var class="Ar">binat</var> rule.</p>
<p class="Pp">Evaluation order of the translation rules is dependent on the type
    of the translation rules and of the direction of a packet.
    <var class="Ar">binat</var> rules are always evaluated first. Then either
    the <var class="Ar">rdr</var> rules are evaluated on an inbound packet or
    the <var class="Ar">nat</var> rules on an outbound packet. Rules of the same
    type are evaluated in the same order in which they appear in the ruleset.
    The first matching rule decides what action is taken.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">no</var> option prefixed to a translation rule
    causes packets to remain untranslated, much in the same way as
    <var class="Ar">drop quick</var> works in the packet filter (see below). If
    no rule matches the packet it is passed to the filter engine unmodified.</p>
<p class="Pp">Translation rules apply only to packets that pass through the
    specified interface, and if no interface is specified, translation is
    applied to packets on all interfaces. For instance, redirecting port 80 on
    an external interface to an internal web server will only work for
    connections originating from the outside. Connections to the address of the
    external interface from local hosts will not be redirected, since such
    packets do not actually pass through the external interface. Redirections
    cannot reflect packets back through the interface they arrive on, they can
    only be redirected to hosts connected to different interfaces or to the
    firewall itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that redirecting external incoming connections to the
    loopback address, as in</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>rdr on ne3 inet proto tcp to port smtp -&gt; 127.0.0.1 port spamd</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">will effectively allow an external host to connect to daemons
    bound solely to the loopback address, circumventing the traditional blocking
    of such connections on a real interface. Unless this effect is desired, any
    of the local non-loopback addresses should be used as redirection target
    instead, which allows external connections only to daemons bound to this
    address or not bound to any address.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PACKET_FILTERING"><a class="permalink" href="#PACKET_FILTERING">PACKET
  FILTERING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Packet filter has the ability to <var class="Ar">block</var> and
    <var class="Ar">pass</var> packets based on attributes of their layer 3 (see
    <a class="Xr" href="../4/ip">ip(4)</a> and
    <a class="Xr" href="../4/ip6">ip6(4)</a>) and layer 4 (see
    <a class="Xr" href="../4/icmp">icmp(4)</a>,
    <a class="Xr" href="../4/icmp6">icmp6(4)</a>,
    <a class="Xr" href="../4/tcp">tcp(4)</a>,
    <a class="Xr" href="../4/udp">udp(4)</a>) headers. In addition, packets may
    also be assigned to queues for the purpose of bandwidth control.</p>
<p class="Pp">For each packet processed by the packet filter, the filter rules
    are evaluated in sequential order, from first to last. The last matching
    rule decides what action is taken. If no rule matches the packet, the
    default action is to pass the packet.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following actions can be used in the filter:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><var class="Ar">block</var></dt>
  <dd>The packet is blocked. There are a number of ways in which a
      <var class="Ar">block</var> rule can behave when blocking a packet. The
      default behaviour is to <var class="Ar">drop</var> packets silently,
      however this can be overridden or made explicit either globally, by
      setting the <var class="Ar">block-policy</var> option, or on a per-rule
      basis with one of the following options:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <dl class="Bl-tag Bl-compact">
      <dt><var class="Ar">drop</var></dt>
      <dd>The packet is silently dropped.</dd>
      <dt><var class="Ar">return-rst</var></dt>
      <dd>This applies only to <a class="Xr" href="../4/tcp">tcp(4)</a> packets,
          and issues a TCP RST which closes the connection.</dd>
      <dt><var class="Ar">return-icmp</var></dt>
      <dd style="width: auto;">&#x00A0;</dd>
      <dt><var class="Ar">return-icmp6</var></dt>
      <dd>This causes ICMP messages to be returned for packets which match the
          rule. By default this is an ICMP UNREACHABLE message, however this can
          be overridden by specifying a message as a code or number.</dd>
      <dt><var class="Ar">return</var></dt>
      <dd>This causes a TCP RST to be returned for
          <a class="Xr" href="../4/tcp">tcp(4)</a> packets and an ICMP
          UNREACHABLE for UDP and other packets.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p class="Pp">Options returning ICMP packets currently have no effect if
        packet filter operates on a
        <a class="Xr" href="../4/bridge">bridge(4)</a>, as the code to support
        this feature has not yet been implemented.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The simplest mechanism to block everything by default and only
        pass packets that match explicit rules is specify a first filter rule
        of:</p>
    <div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
    <pre>block all</pre>
    </div>
  </dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">pass</var></dt>
  <dd>The packet is passed; state is created unless the <var class="Ar">no
      state</var> option is specified.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">By default packet filter filters packets statefully; the first
    time a packet matches a <var class="Ar">pass</var> rule, a state entry is
    created; for subsequent packets the filter checks whether the packet matches
    any state. If it does, the packet is passed without evaluation of any rules.
    After the connection is closed or times out, the state entry is
    automatically removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">This has several advantages. For TCP connections, comparing a
    packet to a state involves checking its sequence numbers, as well as TCP
    timestamps if a <var class="Ar">scrub reassemble tcp</var> rule applies to
    the connection. If these values are outside the narrow windows of expected
    values, the packet is dropped. This prevents spoofing attacks, such as when
    an attacker sends packets with a fake source address/port but does not know
    the connection's sequence numbers. Similarly, packet filter knows how to
    match ICMP replies to states. For example,</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>pass out inet proto icmp all icmp-type echoreq</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">allows echo requests (such as those created by
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/ping">ping(8)</a>) out statefully, and matches
    incoming echo replies correctly to states.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also, looking up states is usually faster than evaluating rules.
    If there are 50 rules, all of them are evaluated sequentially in O(n). Even
    with 50000 states, only 16 comparisons are needed to match a state, since
    states are stored in a binary search tree that allows searches in O(log2
  n).</p>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, correct handling of ICMP error messages is critical
    to many protocols, particularly TCP. Packet filter matches ICMP error
    messages to the correct connection, checks them against connection
    parameters, and passes them if appropriate. For example if an ICMP source
    quench message referring to a stateful TCP connection arrives, it will be
    matched to the state and get passed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, state tracking is required for <var class="Ar">nat</var>,
    <var class="Ar">binat</var> <span class="No">and</span>
    <var class="Ar">rdr</var> rules, in order to track address and port
    translations and reverse the translation on returning packets.</p>
<p class="Pp">Packet filter will also create state for other protocols which are
    effectively stateless by nature. UDP packets are matched to states using
    only host addresses and ports, and other protocols are matched to states
    using only the host addresses.</p>
<p class="Pp">If stateless filtering of individual packets is desired, the
    <var class="Ar">no state</var> keyword can be used to specify that state
    will not be created if this is the last matching rule. A number of
    parameters can also be set to affect how packet filter handles state
    tracking. See <a class="Sx" href="#STATEFUL_TRACKING_OPTIONS">STATEFUL
    TRACKING OPTIONS</a> below for further details.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PARAMETERS"><a class="permalink" href="#PARAMETERS">PARAMETERS</a></h1>

    <p class="Pp">Ranges of addresses are specified by using the

        10.1.1.12&#x201D; means all addresses from 10.1.1.10 to 10.1.1.12, hence

    <p class="Pp">Interface names and interface group names can have modifiers

    <p class="Pp">Host names may also have the <var class="Ar">:0</var> option

    <p class="Pp">Host name resolution and interface to address translation are
        done at ruleset load-time. When the address of an interface (or host
        name) changes (under DHCP or PPP, for instance), the ruleset must be
        reloaded for the change to be reflected in the kernel. Surrounding the
        interface name (and optional modifiers) in parentheses changes this
        behaviour. When the interface name is surrounded by parentheses, the
        rule is automatically updated whenever the interface changes its
        address. The ruleset does not need to be reloaded. This is especially
        useful with <var class="Ar">nat</var>.</p>

  <dd>This rule only applies to packets of sockets owned by the specified user.
      For outgoing connections initiated from the firewall, this is the user
      that opened the connection. For incoming connections to the firewall
      itself, this is the user that listens on the destination port. For
      forwarded connections, where the firewall is not a connection endpoint,
      the user and group are <i class="Em">unknown</i>.
    <p class="Pp">All packets, both outgoing and incoming, of one connection are
        associated with the same user and group. Only TCP and UDP packets can be
        associated with users; for other protocols these parameters are
      ignored.</p>
    <p class="Pp">User and group refer to the effective (as opposed to the real)
        IDs, in case the socket is created by a setuid/setgid process. User and
        group IDs are stored when a socket is created; when a process creates a
        listening socket as root (for instance, by binding to a privileged port)
        and subsequently changes to another user ID (to drop privileges), the
        credentials will remain root.</p>
    <p class="Pp">User and group IDs can be specified as either numbers or
        names. The syntax is similar to the one for ports. The value
        <i class="Em">unknown</i> matches packets of forwarded connections.
        <i class="Em">unknown</i> can only be used with the operators
        <code class="Cm">=</code> and <code class="Cm">!=</code>. Other
        constructs like <code class="Cm">user &#x2265; unknown</code> are
        invalid. Forwarded packets with unknown user and group ID match only
        rules that explicitly compare against <i class="Em">unknown</i> with the
        operators <code class="Cm">=</code> or <code class="Cm">!=</code>. For
        instance <code class="Cm">user &#x2265; 0</code> does not match

  MODULATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Much of the security derived from TCP is attributable to how well
    the initial sequence numbers (ISNs) are chosen. Some popular stack
    implementations choose
    <a class="permalink" href="#very"><i class="Em" id="very">very</i></a> poor
    ISNs and thus are normally susceptible to ISN prediction exploits. By
    applying a <var class="Ar">modulate state</var> rule to a TCP connection,
    packet filter will create a high quality random sequence number for each
    connection endpoint.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">modulate state</var> directive implicitly
    keeps state on the rule and is only applicable to TCP connections.</p>
<p class="Pp">For instance:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>block all
pass out proto tcp from any to any modulate state
pass in  proto tcp from any to any port 25 flags S/SFRA modulate state</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that modulated connections will not recover when the state
    table is lost (firewall reboot, flushing the state table, etc...). Packet
    filter will not be able to infer a connection again after the state table
    flushes the connection's modulator. When the state is lost, the connection
    may be left dangling until the respective endpoints time out the connection.
    It is possible on a fast local network for the endpoints to start an ACK
    storm while trying to resynchronize after the loss of the modulator. The
    default <var class="Ar">flags</var> settings (or a more strict equivalent)

    The <var class="Ar">synproxy state</var> option can be used to cause packet
    filter itself to complete the handshake with the active endpoint, perform a
    handshake with the passive endpoint, and then forward packets between the
    endpoints.</p>
<p class="Pp">No packets are sent to the passive endpoint before the active
    endpoint has completed the handshake, hence so-called SYN floods with
    spoofed source addresses will not reach the passive endpoint, as the sender
    can't complete the handshake.</p>
<p class="Pp">The proxy is transparent to both endpoints, they each see a single
    connection from/to the other endpoint. Packet filter chooses random initial
    sequence numbers for both handshakes. Once the handshakes are completed, the

    system. Unfortunately these nuances are easily spoofed by an attacker so the
    fingerprint is not useful in making security decisions. But the fingerprint
    is typically accurate enough to make policy decisions upon.</p>
<p class="Pp">The fingerprints may be specified by operating system class, by
    version, or by subtype/patchlevel. The class of an operating system is
    typically the vendor or genre and would be <span class="Ux">OpenBSD</span>
    for the packet filter firewall itself. The version of the oldest available
    <span class="Ux">OpenBSD</span> release on the main FTP site would be 2.6
    and the fingerprint would be written</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">&quot;OpenBSD 2.6&quot;</code></div>
<p class="Pp">The subtype of an operating system is typically used to describe
    the patchlevel if that patch led to changes in the TCP stack behavior. In
    the case of <span class="Ux">OpenBSD</span>, the only subtype is for a
    fingerprint that was normalized by the <var class="Ar">no-df</var> scrub
    option and would be specified as</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">&quot;OpenBSD 3.3
  no-df&quot;</code></div>
<p class="Pp">Fingerprints for most popular operating systems are provided by
    <a class="Xr" href="../5/pf.os">pf.os(5)</a>. Once packet filter is running,
    a complete list of known operating system fingerprints may be listed by
    running:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li"># pfctl -so</code></div>
<p class="Pp">Filter rules can enforce policy at any level of operating system
    specification assuming a fingerprint is present. Policy could limit traffic
    to approved operating systems or even ban traffic from hosts that aren't at
    the latest service pack.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">unknown</var> class can also be used as the
    fingerprint which will match packets for which no operating system
    fingerprint is known.</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>pass  out proto tcp from any os OpenBSD
block out proto tcp from any os Doors
block out proto tcp from any os &quot;Doors PT&quot;
block out proto tcp from any os &quot;Doors PT SP3&quot;
block out from any os &quot;unknown&quot;
pass on lo0 proto tcp from any os &quot;OpenBSD 3.3 lo0&quot;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Operating system fingerprinting is limited only to the TCP SYN
    packet. This means that it will not work on other protocols and will not
    match a currently established connection.</p>
<p class="Pp">Caveat: operating system fingerprints are occasionally wrong.
    There are three problems: an attacker can trivially craft his packets to
    appear as any operating system he chooses; an operating system patch could
    change the stack behavior and no fingerprints will match it until the
    database is updated; and multiple operating systems may have the same
    fingerprint.</p>

  SPOOFED TRAFFIC</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">&quot;Spoofing&quot; is the faking of IP addresses, typically for
    malicious purposes. The <var class="Ar">antispoof</var> directive expands to
    a set of filter rules which will block all traffic with a source IP from the
    network(s) directly connected to the specified interface(s) from entering
    the system through any other interface.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the line</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>antispoof for lo0</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">expands to</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>block drop in on ! lo0 inet from 127.0.0.1/8 to any
block drop in on ! lo0 inet6 from ::1 to any</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">For non-loopback interfaces, there are additional rules to block
    incoming packets with a source IP address identical to the interface's
    IP(s). For example, assuming the interface wi0 had an IP address of 10.0.0.1
    and a netmask of 255.255.255.0, the line</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>antispoof for wi0 inet</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">expands to</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>block drop in on ! wi0 inet from 10.0.0.0/24 to any
block drop in inet from 10.0.0.1 to any</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Caveat: Rules created by the <var class="Ar">antispoof</var>
    directive interfere with packets sent over loopback interfaces to local
    addresses. One should pass these explicitly.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FRAGMENT_HANDLING"><a class="permalink" href="#FRAGMENT_HANDLING">FRAGMENT
  HANDLING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The size of IP datagrams (packets) can be significantly larger
    than the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the network. In cases when it is
    necessary or more efficient to send such large packets, the large packet
    will be fragmented into many smaller packets that will each fit onto the
    wire. Unfortunately for a firewalling device, only the first logical
    fragment will contain the necessary header information for the subprotocol
    that allows packet filter to filter on things such as TCP ports or to
    perform NAT.</p>
<p class="Pp">Besides the use of <var class="Ar">scrub</var> rules as described
    in <a class="Sx" href="#TRAFFIC_NORMALIZATION">TRAFFIC NORMALIZATION</a>
    above, there are three options for handling fragments in the packet
  filter.</p>
<p class="Pp">One alternative is to filter individual fragments with filter
    rules. If no <var class="Ar">scrub</var> rule applies to a fragment, it is
    passed to the filter. Filter rules with matching IP header parameters decide
    whether the fragment is passed or blocked, in the same way as complete
    packets are filtered. Without reassembly, fragments can only be filtered
    based on IP header fields (source/destination address, protocol), since
    subprotocol header fields are not available (TCP/UDP port numbers, ICMP
    code/type). The <var class="Ar">fragment</var> option can be used to
    restrict filter rules to apply only to fragments, but not complete packets.
    Filter rules without the <var class="Ar">fragment</var> option still apply
    to fragments, if they only specify IP header fields. For instance, the
  rule</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>pass in proto tcp from any to any port 80</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">never applies to a fragment, even if the fragment is part of a TCP
    packet with destination port 80, because without reassembly this information
    is not available for each fragment. This also means that fragments cannot
    create new or match existing state table entries, which makes stateful
    filtering and address translation (NAT, redirection) for fragments
    impossible.</p>
<p class="Pp">It's also possible to reassemble only certain fragments by
    specifying source or destination addresses or protocols as parameters in
    <var class="Ar">scrub</var> rules.</p>
<p class="Pp">In most cases, the benefits of reassembly outweigh the additional
    memory cost, and it's recommended to use <var class="Ar">scrub</var> rules
    to reassemble all fragments via the <var class="Ar">fragment
    reassemble</var> modifier.</p>
<p class="Pp">The memory allocated for fragment caching can be limited using
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/pfctl">pfctl(8)</a>. Once this limit is reached,
    fragments that would have to be cached are dropped until other entries time
    out. The timeout value can also be adjusted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Currently, only IPv4 fragments are supported and IPv6 fragments
    are blocked unconditionally.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ANCHORS"><a class="permalink" href="#ANCHORS">ANCHORS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Besides the main ruleset,
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/pfctl">pfctl(8)</a> can load rulesets into
    <var class="Ar">anchor</var> attachment points. An
    <var class="Ar">anchor</var> is a container that can hold rules, address
    tables, and other anchors.</p>
<p class="Pp">An <var class="Ar">anchor</var> has a name which specifies the
    path where <a class="Xr" href="../8/pfctl">pfctl(8)</a> can be used to
    access the anchor to perform operations on it, such as attaching child
    anchors to it or loading rules into it. Anchors may be nested, with
    components separated by &#x2018;/&#x2019; characters, similar to how file
    system hierarchies are laid out. The main ruleset is actually the default
    anchor, so filter and translation rules, for example, may also be contained
    in any anchor.</p>
<p class="Pp">An anchor can reference another <var class="Ar">anchor</var>
    attachment point using the following kinds of rules:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><var class="Ar">nat-anchor</var>
    &#x27E8;<var class="Ar">name</var>&#x27E9;</dt>
  <dd>Evaluates the <var class="Ar">nat</var> rules in the specified
      <var class="Ar">anchor</var>.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">rdr-anchor</var>
    &#x27E8;<var class="Ar">name</var>&#x27E9;</dt>
  <dd>Evaluates the <var class="Ar">rdr</var> rules in the specified
      <var class="Ar">anchor</var>.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">binat-anchor</var>
    &#x27E8;<var class="Ar">name</var>&#x27E9;</dt>
  <dd>Evaluates the <var class="Ar">binat</var> rules in the specified
      <var class="Ar">anchor</var>.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">anchor</var>
    &#x27E8;<var class="Ar">name</var>&#x27E9;</dt>
  <dd>Evaluates the filter rules in the specified
    <var class="Ar">anchor</var>.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">load anchor</var>
    &#x27E8;<var class="Ar">name</var>&#x27E9; <var class="Ar">from</var>
    &#x27E8;<var class="Ar">file</var>&#x27E9;</dt>
  <dd>Loads the rules from the specified file into the anchor
      <var class="Ar">name</var>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When evaluation of the main ruleset reaches an
    <var class="Ar">anchor</var> rule, packet filter will proceed to evaluate
    all rules specified in that anchor.</p>
<p class="Pp">Matching filter and translation rules marked with the
    <var class="Ar">quick</var> option are final and abort the evaluation of the
    rules in other anchors and the main ruleset. If the
    <var class="Ar">anchor</var> itself is marked with the
    <var class="Ar">quick</var> option, ruleset evaluation will terminate when
    the anchor is exited if the packet is matched by any rule within the
  anchor.</p>
<p class="Pp"><var class="Ar">anchor</var> rules are evaluated relative to the
    anchor in which they are contained. For example, all
    <var class="Ar">anchor</var> rules specified in the main ruleset will
    reference anchor attachment points underneath the main ruleset, and
    <var class="Ar">anchor</var> rules specified in a file loaded from a
    <var class="Ar">load anchor</var> rule will be attached under that anchor
    point.</p>
<p class="Pp">Rules may be contained in <var class="Ar">anchor</var> attachment
    points which do not contain any rules when the main ruleset is loaded, and
    later such anchors can be manipulated through
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/pfctl">pfctl(8)</a> without reloading the main
    ruleset or other anchors. For example,</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>ext_if = &quot;kue0&quot;
block on $ext_if all
anchor spam
pass out on $ext_if all
pass in on $ext_if proto tcp from any \
      to $ext_if port smtp</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">blocks all packets on the external interface by default, then
    evaluates all rules in the <var class="Ar">anchor</var> named
    &quot;spam&quot;, and finally passes all outgoing connections and incoming
    connections to port 25.</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre># echo &quot;block in quick from 1.2.3.4 to any&quot; | \
      pfctl -a spam -f -</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This loads a single rule into the <var class="Ar">anchor</var>,
    which blocks all packets from a specific address.</p>
<p class="Pp">The anchor can also be populated by adding a <var class="Ar">load
    anchor</var> rule after the <var class="Ar">anchor</var> rule:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>anchor spam
load anchor spam from &quot;/etc/pf-spam.conf&quot;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">When <a class="Xr" href="../8/pfctl">pfctl(8)</a> loads
    <code class="Nm">pf.conf</code>, it will also load all the rules from the
    file <span class="Pa">/etc/pf-spam.conf</span> into the anchor.</p>
<p class="Pp">Optionally, <var class="Ar">anchor</var> rules can specify packet
    filtering parameters using the same syntax as filter rules. When parameters
    are used, the <var class="Ar">anchor</var> rule is only evaluated for
    matching packets. This allows conditional evaluation of anchors, like:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>block on $ext_if all
anchor spam proto tcp from any to any port smtp
pass out on $ext_if all
pass in on $ext_if proto tcp from any to $ext_if port smtp</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The rules inside <var class="Ar">anchor</var> spam are only
    evaluated for <var class="Ar">tcp</var> packets with destination port 25.
    Hence,</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre># echo &quot;block in quick from 1.2.3.4 to any&quot; | \
      pfctl -a spam -f -</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">will only block connections from 1.2.3.4 to port 25.</p>
<p class="Pp">Anchors may end with the asterisk (&#x2018;*&#x2019;) character,
    which signifies that all anchors attached at that point should be evaluated
    in the alphabetical ordering of their anchor name. For example,</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>anchor &quot;spam/*&quot;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">will evaluate each rule in each anchor attached to the
    <code class="Li">spam</code> anchor. Note that it will only evaluate anchors
    that are directly attached to the <code class="Li">spam</code> anchor, and
    will not descend to evaluate anchors recursively.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since anchors are evaluated relative to the anchor in which they
    are contained, there is a mechanism for accessing the parent and ancestor
    anchors of a given anchor. Similar to file system path name resolution, if
    the sequence &#x201C;..&#x201D; appears as an anchor path component, the
    parent anchor of the current anchor in the path evaluation at that point
    will become the new current anchor. As an example, consider the
  following:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre># echo ' anchor &quot;spam/allowed&quot; ' | pfctl -f -
# echo -e ' anchor &quot;../banned&quot; \n pass' | \
      pfctl -a spam/allowed -f -</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Evaluation of the main ruleset will lead into the
    <code class="Li">spam/allowed</code> anchor, which will evaluate the rules
    in the <code class="Li">spam/banned</code> anchor, if any, before finally
    evaluating the <var class="Ar">pass</var> rule.</p>
<p class="Pp">Filter rule <var class="Ar">anchors</var> can also be loaded
    inline in the ruleset within a brace ('{' '}') delimited block. Brace
    delimited blocks may contain rules or other brace-delimited blocks. When
    anchors are loaded this way the anchor name becomes optional.</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>anchor &quot;external&quot; on egress {
	block
	anchor out {
		pass proto tcp from any to port { 25, 80, 443 }
	}
	pass in proto tcp to any port 22
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Since the parser specification for anchor names is a string, any
    reference to an anchor name containing &#x2018;/&#x2019; characters will
    require double quote (&#x2018;&quot;&#x2019;) characters around the anchor
    name.</p>

<p class="Pp">This example maps incoming requests on port 80 to port 8080, on
