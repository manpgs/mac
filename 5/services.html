<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">services</code> file contains information
    regarding the known services available in the DARPA Internet. For each
    service a single line should be present with the following information:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>official service name
port number
protocol name
aliases</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp" id="item">Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or tab
    characters. The port number and protocol name are considered a single
    <a class="permalink" href="#item"><i class="Em">item</i></a>; a ``/'' is
    used to separate the port and protocol (e.g. ``512/tcp''). A ``#'' indicates
    the beginning of a comment; subsequent characters up to the end of the line
    are not interpreted by the routines which search the file.</p>

    X, these functions interact with the
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/DirectoryService">DirectoryService(8)</a> daemon,
    which reads the /etc/services file as well as searching other directory
    information services to determine service name, protocol, and port
