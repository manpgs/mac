<p class="Pp">Some file formats in Git use a common concept of
    &quot;chunks&quot; to describe sections of the file. This allows structured
    access to a large file by scanning a small &quot;table of contents&quot; for
    the remaining data. This common format is used by the <b>commit-graph</b>
    and <b>multi-pack-index</b> files. See the <b>multi-pack-index</b> format in
    <b>gitformat-pack</b>(5) and the <b>commit-graph</b> format in
    <b>gitformat-commit-graph</b>(5) for how they use the chunks to describe
    structured data.</p>
<p class="Pp">A chunk-based file format begins with some header information
    custom to that format. That header should include enough information to
    identify the file type, format version, and number of chunks in the file.
    From this information, that file can determine the start of the chunk-based
    region.</p>
<p class="Pp">The chunk-based region starts with a table of contents describing
    where each chunk starts and ends. This consists of (C+1) rows of 12 bytes
    each, where C is the number of chunks. Consider the following table:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>| Chunk ID (4 bytes) | Chunk Offset (8 bytes) |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| ID[0]              | OFFSET[0]              |
| ...                | ...                    |
| ID[C]              | OFFSET[C]              |
| 0x0000             | OFFSET[C+1]            |</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Each row consists of a 4-byte chunk identifier (ID) and an 8-byte
    offset. Each integer is stored in network-byte order.</p>
<p class="Pp">The chunk identifier <b>ID[i]</b> is a label for the data stored
    within this fill from <b>OFFSET[i]</b> (inclusive) to <b>OFFSET[i+1]</b>
    (exclusive). Thus, the size of the <b>i`th chunk is equal to the difference
    between `OFFSET[i+1]</b> and <b>OFFSET[i]</b>. This requires that the chunk
    data appears contiguously in the same order as the table of contents.</p>
<p class="Pp">The final entry in the table of contents must be four zero bytes.
    This confirms that the table of contents is ending and provides the offset
    for the end of the chunk-based data.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: The chunk-based format expects that the file contains <i>at
    least</i> a trailing hash after <b>OFFSET[C+1]</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Functions for working with chunk-based file formats are declared
    in <b>chunk-format.h</b>. Using these methods provide extra checks that
    assist developers when creating new file formats.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="WRITING_CHUNK"><a class="permalink" href="#WRITING_CHUNK">WRITING
  CHUNK-BASED FILE FORMATS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">To write a chunk-based file format, create a <b>struct
    chunkfile</b> by calling <b>init_chunkfile()</b> and pass a <b>struct
    hashfile</b> pointer. The caller is responsible for opening the
    <b>hashfile</b> and writing header information so the file format is
    identifiable before the chunk-based format begins.</p>
<p class="Pp">Then, call <b>add_chunk()</b> for each chunk that is intended for
    write. This populates the <b>chunkfile</b> with information about the order
    and size of each chunk to write. Provide a <b>chunk_write_fn</b> function
    pointer to perform the write of the chunk data upon request.</p>
<p class="Pp">Call <b>write_chunkfile()</b> to write the table of contents to
    the <b>hashfile</b> followed by each of the chunks. This will verify that
    each chunk wrote the expected amount of data so the table of contents is
    correct.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, call <b>free_chunkfile()</b> to clear the <b>struct
    chunkfile</b> data. The caller is responsible for finalizing the
    <b>hashfile</b> by writing the trailing hash and closing the file.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="READING_CHUNK"><a class="permalink" href="#READING_CHUNK">READING
  CHUNK-BASED FILE FORMATS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">To read a chunk-based file format, the file must be opened as a
    memory-mapped region. The chunk-format API expects that the entire file is
    mapped as a contiguous memory region.</p>
<p class="Pp">Initialize a <b>struct chunkfile</b> pointer with
    <b>init_chunkfile(NULL)</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">After reading the header information from the beginning of the
    file, including the chunk count, call <b>read_table_of_contents()</b> to
    populate the <b>struct chunkfile</b> with the list of chunks, their offsets,
    and their sizes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Extract the data information for each chunk using
    <b>pair_chunk()</b> or <b>read_chunk()</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>pair_chunk()</b> assigns a given pointer with
  the location inside the memory-mapped file corresponding to that
  chunk&#x2019;s offset. If the chunk does not exist, then the pointer is not
  modified.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>read_chunk()</b> takes a <b>chunk_read_fn</b>
  function pointer and calls it with the appropriate initial pointer and size
  information. The function is not called if the chunk does not exist. Use this
  method to read chunks if you need to perform immediate parsing or if you need
  to execute logic based on the size of the chunk.</div>
<p class="Pp">After calling these methods, call <b>free_chunkfile()</b> to clear
    the <b>struct chunkfile</b> data. This will not close the memory-mapped
    region. Callers are expected to own that data for the timeframe the pointers
    into the region are needed.</p>
