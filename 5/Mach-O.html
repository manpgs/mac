<p class="Pp">The object files produced by the assembler and link editor are in
    Mach-O (Mach object) file format. The file name <i>a.out</i> is the default
    output file name of the assembler <i>as</i>(1) and the link editor
    <i>ld</i>(1) The format of the object file however is not 4.3BSD a.out
    format as the name suggests, but rather Mach-O format. The link editor will
    make <i>a.out</i> executable if the resulting format is an executable type
    and there were no errors and no unresolved external references.</p>
<p class="Pp">The complete description of a Mach-O file is given in a number of
    include files. The file &lt;mach-o/loader.h&gt; describes the headers,
    &lt;mach-o/nlist.h&gt; describes the symbol table entries with
    &lt;mach-o/stab.h&gt; supplementing it, and &lt;mach-o/reloc.h&gt; describes
    the relocation entries.</p>
<p class="Pp">The actual instructions and data used by the program represented
    by a Mach-O file are the contents of its sections. Sections are grouped
    together in segments. Each section carries with it, in its header, the
    information as to which segment it belongs in. When a file type that is
    executable is created the sections are placed in their proper segment and
    all the segment headers are created and the segments themselves are padded
    out to the segment alignment (typically the target pagesize). For the object
    file type produced by an assembler (or by the link editor for further
    linking) all the sections are placed in one segment for compactness.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the kernel executes a Mach-O file it maps in the object
    file's segments, the dynamic link editor (if used) and creates the thread(s)
    for execution. Any part of the object file that is not part of a segment is
    not mapped in for execution. For executable using the dynamic link editor
    the headers and other link edit information is needed to execute the file.
    These parts include the relocation entries, the symbol table and the string
    table. These parts are mapped in with the use of the link editor's
    <b>-seglinkedit</b> option which creates a segment that contains these
    parts. These parts can be stripped down with the <b>-S</b> option to
    <i>ld</i>(1) or various options to <i>strip</i>(1).</p>
