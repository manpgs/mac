<p class="Pp">Security Event Audit is a facility to provide fine-grained,
    configurable logging of security-relevant events, and is intended to meet
    the requirements of the Common Criteria (CC) Common Access Protection
    Profile (CAPP) evaluation. The <span class="Ux">FreeBSD</span> and Mac OS X
    <code class="Nm">audit</code> facility implements the de facto industry
    standard BSM API, file formats, and command line interface, first found in
    the Solaris operating system. Information on the user space implementation
    can be found in <a class="Xr" href="../3/libbsm">libbsm(3)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Audit support is enabled at boot, if present in the kernel, using
    an <a class="Xr" href="../5/rc.conf">rc.conf(5)</a> flag or, on Mac OS X, by
    editing the
    <span class="Pa">/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.auditd.plist</span>
    launchd plist file and removing the disabled key or changing its value to
    false. The audit daemon, <a class="Xr" href="../8/auditd">auditd(8)</a>, is
    responsible for configuring the kernel to perform
    <code class="Nm">audit</code>, pushing configuration data from the various
    audit configuration files into the kernel.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Audit_Special_Device"><a class="permalink" href="#Audit_Special_Device">Audit
  Special Device</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Ux">FreeBSD</span> kernel
    <code class="Nm">audit</code> facility provides a special device,
    <span class="Pa">/dev/audit</span>, which is used by
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/auditd">auditd(8)</a> to monitor for
    <code class="Nm">audit</code> events, such as requests to cycle the log, low
    disk space conditions, and requests to terminate auditing. This device is
    not intended for use by applications. Mac OS X provides this same
    functionality using Mach IPC and a host special port.</p>

  Pipe Special Devices</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Audit pipe special devices, discussed in
    <a class="Xr" href="../4/auditpipe">auditpipe(4)</a>, provide a configurable
    live tracking mechanism to allow applications to tee the audit trail, as
    well as to configure custom preselection parameters to track users and
    events in a fine-grained manner.</p>

<p class="Pp">The OpenBSM implementation was created by McAfee Research, the
    security division of McAfee Inc., under contract to Apple Computer Inc. in
    2004. It was subsequently adopted by the TrustedBSD Project as the
    foundation for the OpenBSM distribution.</p>
<p class="Pp">Support for kernel <code class="Nm">audit</code> first appeared in
    Mac OS X 10.3 and <span class="Ux">FreeBSD 6.2</span>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">audit</code> facility in
    <span class="Ux">FreeBSD</span> is considered experimental, and production
    deployment should occur only after careful consideration of the risks of
    deploying experimental software.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Mac OS X and <span class="Ux">FreeBSD</span> kernel do not
    fully validate that audit records submitted by user applications are
    syntactically valid BSM; as submission of records is limited to privileged
    processes, this is not a critical bug.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instrumentation of auditable events in the kernel is not complete,
    as some system calls do not generate audit records, or generate audit
    records with incomplete argument information.</p>
<p class="Pp">Mandatory Access Control (MAC) labels, as provided by the
    <a class="Xr" href="../4/mac">mac(4)</a> facility, are not audited as part
    of records involving MAC decisions.</p>
