<p class="Pp">The UNIX-domain protocol family is a collection of protocols that
    provides local (on-machine) interprocess communication through the normal
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/socket">socket(2)</a> mechanisms. The UNIX-domain
    family supports the <code class="Dv">SOCK_STREAM</code> and
    <code class="Dv">SOCK_DGRAM</code> socket types and uses filesystem
    pathnames for addressing.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ADDRESSING"><a class="permalink" href="#ADDRESSING">ADDRESSING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">UNIX-domain addresses are variable-length filesystem pathnames of
    at most 104 characters. The include file
    &#x27E8;<span class="Pa">sys/un.h</span>&#x27E9; defines this address:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>struct sockaddr_un {
	u_char	sun_len;
	u_char	sun_family;
	char	sun_path[104];
};</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Binding a name to a UNIX-domain socket with
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/bind">bind(2)</a> causes a socket file to be
    created in the filesystem. This file is <i class="Em">not</i> removed when
    the socket is closed&#x2014;<a class="Xr" href="../2/unlink">unlink(2)</a>
    must be used to remove the file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The UNIX-domain protocol family does not support broadcast
    addressing or any form of &#x201C;wildcard&#x201D; matching on incoming
    messages. All addresses are absolute- or relative-pathnames of other
    UNIX-domain sockets. Normal filesystem access-control mechanisms are also
    applied when referencing pathnames; e.g., the destination of a
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/connect">connect(2)</a> or
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/sendto">sendto(2)</a> must be writable.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PROTOCOLS"><a class="permalink" href="#PROTOCOLS">PROTOCOLS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The UNIX-domain protocol family is comprised of simple transport
    protocols that support the <code class="Dv">SOCK_STREAM</code> and
    <code class="Dv">SOCK_DGRAM</code> abstractions.
    <code class="Dv">SOCK_STREAM</code> sockets also support the communication
    of <span class="Ux">UNIX</span> file descriptors through the use of the
    <var class="Ar">msg_control</var> field in the <var class="Ar">msg</var>
    argument to <a class="Xr" href="../2/sendmsg">sendmsg(2)</a> and
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/recvmsg">recvmsg(2)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any valid descriptor may be sent in a message. The file
    descriptor(s) to be passed are described using a <var class="Ar">struct
    cmsghdr</var> that is defined in the include file
    &#x27E8;<span class="Pa">sys/socket.h</span>&#x27E9;. The type of the
    message is <code class="Dv">SCM_RIGHTS</code>, and the data portion of the
    messages is an array of integers representing the file descriptors to be
    passed. The number of descriptors being passed is defined by the length
    field of the message; the length field is the sum of the size of the header
    plus the size of the array of file descriptors.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="duplicate">The received descriptor is a
    <a class="permalink" href="#duplicate"><i class="Em">duplicate</i></a> of
    the sender's descriptor, as if it were created with a call to
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/dup">dup(2)</a>. Per-process descriptor flags, set
    with <a class="Xr" href="../2/fcntl">fcntl(2)</a>, are <i class="Em">not</i>
    passed to a receiver. Descriptors that are awaiting delivery, or that are
    purposely not received, are automatically closed by the system when the
    destination socket is closed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The effective credentials (i.e., the user ID and group list) the
    of a peer on a <code class="Dv">SOCK_STREAM</code> socket may be obtained
    using the <code class="Dv">LOCAL_PEERCRED</code> socket option. This may be
    used by a server to obtain and verify the credentials of its client, and
    vice versa by the client to verify the credentials of the server. These will
    arrive in the form of a filled in <var class="Ar">struct xucred</var>
    (defined in <span class="Pa">sys/ucred.h</span>). The credentials presented
    to the server (the <a class="Xr" href="../2/listen">listen(2)</a> caller)
    are those of the client when it called
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/connect">connect(2)</a>; the credentials presented
    to the client (the <a class="Xr" href="../2/connect">connect(2)</a> caller)
    are those of the server when it called
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/listen">listen(2)</a>. This mechanism is reliable;
    there is no way for either party to influence the credentials presented to
    its peer except by calling the appropriate system call (e.g.,
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/connect">connect(2)</a> or
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/listen">listen(2)</a>) under different effective
    credentials.</p>
