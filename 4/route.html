<p class="Pp">Mac OS X provides some packet routing facilities. The kernel
    maintains a routing information database, which is used in selecting the
    appropriate network interface when transmitting packets.</p>
<p class="Pp">A user process (or possibly multiple co-operating processes)
    maintains this database by sending messages over a special kind of socket.
    This supplants fixed size <a class="Xr" href="../2/ioctl">ioctl(2)</a>'s
    used in earlier releases. Routing table changes may only be carried out by
    the super user.</p>
<p class="Pp">The operating system may spontaneously emit routing messages in
    response to external events, such as receipt of a re-direct, or failure to
    locate a suitable route for a request. The message types are described in
    greater detail below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Routing database entries come in two flavors: for a specific host,
    or for all hosts on a generic subnetwork (as specified by a bit mask and
    value under the mask. The effect of wildcard or default route may be
    achieved by using a mask of all zeros, and there may be hierarchical
  routes.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the system is booted and addresses are assigned to the
    network interfaces, each protocol family installs a routing table entry for
    each interface when it is ready for traffic. Normally the protocol specifies
    the route through each interface as a &#x201C;direct&#x201D; connection to
    the destination host or network. If the route is direct, the transport layer
    of a protocol family usually requests the packet be sent to the same host
    specified in the packet. Otherwise, the interface is requested to address
    the packet to the gateway listed in the routing entry (i.e. the packet is
    forwarded).</p>
<p class="Pp">When routing a packet, the kernel will attempt to find the most
    specific route matching the destination. (If there are two different mask
    and value-under-the-mask pairs that match, the more specific is the one with
    more bits in the mask. A route to a host is regarded as being supplied with
    a mask of as many ones as there are bits in the destination). If no entry is
    found, the destination is declared to be unreachable, and a routing-miss
    message is generated if there are any listers on the routing control socket
    described below.</p>
<p class="Pp">A wildcard routing entry is specified with a zero destination
    address value, and a mask of all zeroes. Wildcard routes will be used when
    the system fails to find other routes matching the destination. The
    combination of wildcard routes and routing redirects can provide an
    economical mechanism for routing traffic.</p>
<p class="Pp">One opens the channel for passing routing control messages by
    using the socket call shown in the synopsis above:</p>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Fa">family</var> parameter may be
    <code class="Dv">AF_UNSPEC</code> which will provide routing information for
    all address families, or can be restricted to a specific address family by
    specifying which one is desired. There can be more than one routing socket
    open per system.</p>
<p class="Pp">Messages are formed by a header followed by a small number of
    sockadders (now variable length particularly in the ISO case), interpreted
    by position, and delimited by the new length entry in the sockaddr. An
    example of a message with four addresses might be an ISO redirect:
    Destination, Netmask, Gateway, and Author of the redirect. The
    interpretation of which address are present is given by a bit mask within
    the header, and the sequence is least significant to most significant bit
    within the vector.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any messages sent to the kernel are returned, and copies are sent
    to all interested listeners. The kernel will provide the process id. for the
    sender, and the sender may use an additional sequence field to distinguish
    between outstanding messages. However, message replies may be lost when
    kernel buffers are exhausted.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="errno">The kernel may reject certain messages, and will
    indicate this by filling in the <var class="Ar">rtm_errno</var> field. The
    routing code returns <code class="Dv">EEXIST</code> if requested to
    duplicate an existing entry, <code class="Dv">ESRCH</code> if requested to
    delete a non-existent entry, or <code class="Dv">ENOBUFS</code> if
    insufficient resources were available to install a new route. In the current
    implementation, all routing process run locally, and the values for
    <var class="Ar">rtm_errno</var> are available through the normal
    <a class="permalink" href="#errno"><i class="Em">errno</i></a> mechanism,
    even if the routing reply message is lost.</p>
<p class="Pp">A process may avoid the expense of reading replies to its own
    messages by issuing a <a class="Xr" href="../2/setsockopt">setsockopt(2)</a>
    call indicating that the <code class="Dv">SO_USELOOPBACK</code> option at
    the <code class="Dv">SOL_SOCKET</code> level is to be turned off. A process
    may ignore all messages from the routing socket by doing a
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/shutdown">shutdown(2)</a> system call for further
    input.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a route is in use when it is deleted, the routing entry will be
    marked down and removed from the routing table, but the resources associated
    with it will not be reclaimed until all references to it are released. User
    processes can obtain information about the routing entry to a specific
    destination by using a <code class="Dv">RTM_GET</code> message.</p>
