<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">loop</code> interface is a software loopback
    mechanism which may be used for performance analysis, software testing,
    and/or local communication. As with other network interfaces, the loopback
    interface must have network addresses assigned for each address family with
    which it is to be used. These addresses may be set or changed with the
    <code class="Dv">SIOCSIFADDR</code>
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/ioctl">ioctl(2)</a>. The loopback interface should
    be the last interface configured, as protocols may use the order of
    configuration as an indication of priority. The loopback should
    <a class="permalink" href="#never"><i class="Em" id="never">never</i></a> be
    configured first unless no hardware interfaces exist.</p>

    address is now discouraged; a reserved host address for the local network
    should be used instead.</p>
