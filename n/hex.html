   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">The command <b>hex</b> is one of several data encodings provided
    by the package <b>trf</b>. See <b>trf-intro</b> for an overview of the whole
    package.</p>
<p class="Pp">This encoding transforms every byte in the input into a sequence
    of 2 characters containing the hexadecimal representation of the byte. For
    example</p>

  <dd>This option has to be present and is always understood by the encoding.
    <p class="Pp">For <i>immediate</i> mode the argument value specifies the
        operation to use. For an <i>attached</i> encoding it specifies the
        operation to use for <i>writing</i>. Reading will automatically use the
        reverse operation. See section <b>IMMEDIATE versus ATTACHED</b> for
        explanations of these two terms.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Beyond the argument values listed above all unique
        abbreviations are recognized too.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Encode</b> converts from arbitrary (most likely binary)
        data into the described representation, <b>decode</b> does the reverse
      .</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="attach"><a class="permalink" href="#attach"><b>-attach</b>
    <i>channel</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The presence/absence of this option determines the main operation mode of
      the transformation.
    <p class="Pp">If present the transformation will be stacked onto the
        <i>channel</i> whose handle was given to the option and run in
        <i>attached</i> mode. More about this in section <b>IMMEDIATE versus
        ATTACHED</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the option is absent the transformation is used in
        <i>immediate</i> mode and the options listed below are recognized. More
        about this in section <b>IMMEDIATE versus ATTACHED</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="in"><a class="permalink" href="#in"><b>-in</b> <i>channel</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This options is legal if and only if the transformation is used in
      <i>immediate</i> mode. It provides the handle of the channel the data to
      transform has to be read from.
    <p class="Pp">If the transformation is in <i>immediate</i> mode and this
        option is absent the data to transform is expected as the last argument
        to the transformation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="out"><a class="permalink" href="#out"><b>-out</b>
    <i>channel</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This options is legal if and only if the transformation is used in
      <i>immediate</i> mode. It provides the handle of the channel the generated
      transformation result is written to.
    <p class="Pp">If the transformation is in <i>immediate</i> mode and this
        option is absent the generated data is returned as the result of the
        command itself.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="IMMEDIATE_VERSUS_ATTACHED"><a class="permalink" href="#IMMEDIATE_VERSUS_ATTACHED">IMMEDIATE
  VERSUS ATTACHED</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The transformation distinguishes between two main ways of using
    it. These are the <i>immediate</i> and <i>attached</i> operation modes.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the <i>attached</i> mode the option <b>-attach</b> is used to
    associate the transformation with an existing channel. During the execution
    of the command no transformation is performed, instead the channel is
    changed in such a way, that from then on all data written to or read from it
    passes through the transformation and is modified by it according to the
    definition above. This attachment can be revoked by executing the command
    <b>unstack</b> for the chosen channel. This is the only way to do this at
    the Tcl level.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the second mode, which can be detected by the absence of option
    <b>-attach</b>, the transformation immediately takes data from either its
    commandline or a channel, transforms it, and returns the result either as
    result of the command, or writes it into a channel. The mode is named after
    the immediate nature of its execution.</p>
<p class="Pp">Where the data is taken from, and delivered to, is governed by the
    presence and absence of the options <b>-in</b> and <b>-out</b>. It should be
    noted that this ability to immediately read from and/or write to a channel
    is an historic artifact which was introduced at the beginning of Trf's life
    when Tcl version 7.6 was current as this and earlier versions have trouble
    to deal with \0 characters embedded into either input or output.</p>
