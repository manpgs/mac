   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   SCCS: @(#) man.macros 1.9 97/08/22 18:50:59
  
  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.

<p class="Pp"><b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> provides object-oriented extensions to
    Tcl, much as C++ provides object-oriented extensions to C. The emphasis of
    this work, however, is not to create a whiz-bang object-oriented programming
    environment. Rather, it is to support more structured programming practices
    in Tcl without changing the flavor of the language. More than anything else,
    <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> provides a means of encapsulating related
    procedures together with their shared data in a namespace that is hidden
    from the outside world. It encourages better programming by promoting the
    object-oriented &quot;library&quot; mindset. It also allows for code re-use
    through inheritance.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CLASSES"><a class="permalink" href="#CLASSES">CLASSES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The fundamental construct in <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> is the class
    definition. Each class acts as a template for actual objects that can be
    created. Each object has its own unique bundle of data, which contains
    instances of the &quot;variables&quot; defined in the class. Special
    procedures called &quot;methods&quot; are used to manipulate individual
    objects. Methods are just like the operations that are used to manipulate Tk
    widgets. The &quot;<b>button</b>&quot; widget, for example, has methods such
    as &quot;flash&quot; and &quot;invoke&quot; that cause a particular button
    to blink and invoke its command.</p>
<p class="Pp">Within the body of a method, the &quot;variables&quot; defined in
    the class are automatically available. They need not be declared with
    anything like the <b>global</b> command. Within another class method, a
    method can be invoked like any other command-simply by using its name. From
    any other context, the method name must be prefaced by an object name, which
    provides a context for the data that the method can access.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each class has its own namespace containing things that are common
    to all objects which belong to the class. For example, &quot;common&quot;
    data members are shared by all objects in the class. They are global
    variables that exist in the class namespace, but since they are included in
    the class definition, they need not be declared using the <b>global</b>
    command; they are automatically available to any code executing in the class
    context. A class can also create ordinary global variables, but these must
    be declared using the <b>global</b> command each time they are used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Classes can also have ordinary procedures declared as
    &quot;procs&quot;. Within another class method or proc, a proc can be
    invoked like any other command-simply by using its name. From any other
    context, the procedure name should be qualified with the class namespace
    like &quot;<i>className</i><b>::</b><i>proc</i>&quot;. Class procs execute
    in the class context, and therefore have automatic access to all
    &quot;common&quot; data members. However, they cannot access object-specific
    &quot;variables&quot;, since they are invoked without reference to any
    specific object. They are usually used to perform generic operations which
    affect all objects belonging to the class.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each of the elements in a class can be declared
    &quot;public&quot;, &quot;protected&quot; or &quot;private&quot;. Public
    elements can be accessed by the class, by derived classes (other classes
    that inherit this class), and by external clients that use the class.
    Protected elements can be accessed by the class, and by derived classes.
    Private elements are only accessible in the class where they are
  defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;public&quot; elements within a class define its
    interface to the external world. Public methods define the operations that
    can be used to manipulate an object. Public variables are recognized as
    configuration options by the &quot;configure&quot; and &quot;cget&quot;
    methods that are built into each class. The public interface says
    <i>what</i> an object will do but not <i>how</i> it will do it. Protected
    and private members, along with the bodies of class methods and procs,
    provide the implementation details. Insulating the application developer
    from these details leaves the class designer free to change them at any
    time, without warning, and without affecting programs that rely on the
    class. It is precisely this encapsulation that makes object-oriented
    programs easier to understand and maintain.</p>
<p class="Pp">The fact that <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> objects look like Tk
    widgets is no accident. <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> was designed this way, to
    blend naturally into a Tcl/Tk application. But <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b>
    extends the Tk paradigm from being merely object-based to being fully
    object-oriented. An object-oriented system supports inheritance, allowing
    classes to share common behaviors by inheriting them from an ancestor or
    base class. Having a base class as a common abstraction allows a programmer
    to treat related classes in a similar manner. For example, a toaster and a
    blender perform different (specialized) functions, but both share the
    abstraction of being appliances. By abstracting common behaviors into a base
    class, code can be <i>shared</i> rather than <i>copied</i>. The resulting
    application is easier to understand and maintain, and derived classes (e.g.,
    specialized appliances) can be added or removed more easily.</p>
<p class="Pp">This description was merely a brief overview of object-oriented
    programming and <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b>. A more tutorial introduction is
    presented in the paper included with this distribution. See the <b>class</b>
    command for more details on creating and using classes.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NAMESPACES"><a class="permalink" href="#NAMESPACES">NAMESPACES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> now includes a complete namespace
    facility. A namespace is a collection of commands and global variables that
    is kept apart from the usual global scope. This allows Tcl code libraries to
    be packaged in a well-defined manner, and prevents unwanted interactions
    with other libraries. A namespace can also have child namespaces within it,
    so one library can contain its own private copy of many other libraries. A
    namespace can also be used to wrap up a group of related classes. The global
    scope (named &quot;::&quot;) is the root namespace for an interpreter; all
    other namespaces are contained within it.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the <b>namespace</b> command for details on creating and using
    namespaces.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="MEGA-WIDGETS"><a class="permalink" href="#MEGA-WIDGETS">MEGA-WIDGETS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Mega-widgets are high-level widgets that are constructed using Tk
    widgets as component parts, usually without any C code. A fileselectionbox,
    for example, may have a few listboxes, some entry widgets and some control
    buttons. These individual widgets are put together in a way that makes them
    act like one big widget.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>[incr&#x00A0;Tk]</b> is a framework for building mega-widgets.
    It uses <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> to support the object paradigm, and adds
    base classes which provide default widget behaviors. See the <b>itk</b> man
    page for more details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>[incr&#x00A0;Widgets]</b> is a library of mega-widgets built
    using <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tk]</b>. It contains more than 30 different widget
    classes that can be used right out of the box to build Tcl/Tk applications.
    Each widget class has its own man page describing the features
  available.</p>
