   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">[<span class="Op"><b>-background</b> <i>background</i>]</span>
    This option is the same as the standard <b>background</b> option except that
    its value may also be specified as an empty string. In this case, the widget
    will display no background or border, and no colors will be consumed from
    its colormap for its background and border. [<span class="Op"><b>-class</b>
    <i>class</i>]</span> Specifies a class for the window. This class will be
    used when querying the option database for the window's other options, and
    it will also be used later for other purposes such as bindings. The
    <b>class</b> option may not be changed with the <b>configure</b> widget
    command. [<span class="Op"><b>-colormap</b> <i>colormap</i>]</span>
    Specifies a colormap to use for the window. The value may be either
    <b>new</b>, in which case a new colormap is created for the window and its
    children, or the name of another window (which must be on the same screen
    and have the same visual as <i>pathName</i>), in which case the new window
    will use the colormap from the specified window. If the <b>colormap</b>
    option is not specified, the new window uses the default colormap of its
    screen. This option may not be changed with the <b>configure</b> widget
    command. [<span class="Op"><b>-container</b> <i>container</i>]</span> The
    value must be a boolean. If true, it means that this window will be used as
    a container in which some other application will be embedded (for example, a
    Tk toplevel can be embedded using the <b>-use</b> option). The window will
    support the appropriate window manager protocols for things like geometry
    requests. The window should not have any children of its own in this
    application. This option may not be changed with the <b>configure</b> widget
    command. [<span class="Op"><b>-height</b> <i>height</i>]</span> Specifies
    the desired height for the window in any of the forms acceptable to
    <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>. If this option is less than or equal to zero then the
    window will not request any size at all. [<span class="Op"><b>-menu</b>
    <i>menu</i>]</span> Specifies a menu widget to be used as a menubar. On the
    Macintosh, the menubar will be displayed across the top of the main monitor.
    On Microsoft Windows and all UNIX platforms, the menu will appear across the
    toplevel window as part of the window dressing maintained by the window
    manager. [<span class="Op"><b>-screen</b> <i></i>]</span> Specifies the
    screen on which to place the new window. Any valid screen name may be used,
    even one associated with a different display. Defaults to the same screen as
    its parent. This option is special in that it may not be specified via the
    option database, and it may not be modified with the <b>configure</b> widget
    command. [<span class="Op"><b>-use</b> <i>use</i>]</span> This option is
    used for embedding. If the value is not an empty string, it must be the
    window identifier of a container window, specified as a hexadecimal string
    like the ones returned by the <b>winfo id</b> command. The toplevel widget
    will be created as a child of the given container instead of the root window
    for the screen. If the container window is in a Tk application, it must be a
    frame or toplevel widget for which the <b>-container</b> option was
    specified. This option may not be changed with the <b>configure</b> widget
    command. [<span class="Op"><b>-visual</b> <i>visual</i>]</span> Specifies
    visual information for the new window in any of the forms accepted by
    <b>Tk_GetVisual</b>. If this option is not specified, the new window will
    use the default visual for its screen. The <b>visual</b> option may not be
    modified with the <b>configure</b> widget command.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-width</b> <i>width</i>]</span> Specifies the desired
    width for the window in any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.
    If this option is less than or equal to zero then the window will not
    request any size at all.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>toplevel</b> command creates a new toplevel widget (given
    by the <i>pathName</i> argument). Additional options, described above, may
    be specified on the command line or in the option database to configure
    aspects of the toplevel such as its background color and relief. The
    <b>toplevel</b> command returns the path name of the new window.</p>
<p class="Pp">A toplevel is similar to a frame except that it is created as a
    top-level window: its X parent is the root window of a screen rather than
    the logical parent from its path name. The primary purpose of a toplevel is
    to serve as a container for dialog boxes and other collections of widgets.
    The only visible features of a toplevel are its background color and an
    optional 3-D border to make the toplevel appear raised or sunken.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="WIDGET_COMMAND"><a class="permalink" href="#WIDGET_COMMAND">WIDGET
  COMMAND</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>toplevel</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name
    is the same as the path name of the toplevel's window. This command may be
    used to invoke various operations on the widget. It has the following
    general form:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>pathName option </i>?<i>arg arg ...</i>?</pre>
</div>
<i>PathName</i> is the name of the command, which is the same as the toplevel
  widget's path name. <i>Option</i> and the <i>arg</i>s determine the exact
  behavior of the command. The following commands are possible for toplevel
  widgets:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="pathName"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName"><i>pathName
    </i><b>cget</b> <i>option</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
      <i>option</i>. <i>Option</i> may have any of the values accepted by the
      <b>toplevel</b> command.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~2"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~2"><i>pathName
    </i><b>configure</b> ?<i>option</i>? ?<i>value option value
    ...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
      <i>option</i> is specified, returns a list describing all of the available
      options for <i>pathName</i> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information
      on the format of this list). If <i>option</i> is specified with no
      <i>value</i>, then the command returns a list describing the one named
      option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the
      value returned if no <i>option</i> is specified). If one or more
      <i>option-value</i> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the
      given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
      command returns an empty string. <i>Option</i> may have any of the values
      accepted by the <b>toplevel</b> command.
