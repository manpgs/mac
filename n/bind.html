   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">The <b>bind</b> command associates Tcl scripts with X events. If
    all three arguments are specified, <b>bind</b> will arrange for
    <i>script</i> (a Tcl script) to be evaluated whenever the event(s) given by
    <i>sequence</i> occur in the window(s) identified by <i>tag</i>. If
    <i>script</i> is prefixed with a &#x201C;+&#x201D;, then it is appended to
    any existing binding for <i>sequence</i>; otherwise <i>script</i> replaces
    any existing binding. If <i>script</i> is an empty string then the current
    binding for <i>sequence</i> is destroyed, leaving <i>sequence</i> unbound.
    In all of the cases where a <i>script</i> argument is provided, <b>bind</b>
    returns an empty string.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>sequence</i> is specified without a <i>script</i>, then the
    script currently bound to <i>sequence</i> is returned, or an empty string is
    returned if there is no binding for <i>sequence</i>. If neither
    <i>sequence</i> nor <i>script</i> is specified, then the return value is a
    list whose elements are all the sequences for which there exist bindings for
    <i>tag</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>tag</i> argument determines which window(s) the binding
    applies to. If <i>tag</i> begins with a dot, as in <b>.a.b.c</b>, then it
    must be the path name for a window; otherwise it may be an arbitrary string.
    Each window has an associated list of tags, and a binding applies to a
    particular window if its tag is among those specified for the window.
    Although the <b>bindtags</b> command may be used to assign an arbitrary set
    of binding tags to a window, the default binding tags provide the following
    behavior:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>If a tag is the name of an internal window the binding applies to that
      window.</li>
  <li>If the tag is the name of a toplevel window the binding applies to the
      toplevel window and all its internal windows.</li>
  <li>If the tag is the name of a class of widgets, such as <b>Button</b>, the
      binding applies to all widgets in that class;</li>
  <li>If <i>tag</i> has the value <b>all</b>, the binding applies to all windows
      in the application.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EVENT_PATTERNS"><a class="permalink" href="#EVENT_PATTERNS">EVENT
  PATTERNS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>sequence</i> argument specifies a sequence of one or more
    event patterns, with optional white space between the patterns. Each event
    pattern may take one of three forms. In the simplest case it is a single
    printing ASCII character, such as <b>a</b> or <b>[</b>. The character may
    not be a space character or the character <b>&lt;</b>. This form of pattern
    matches a <b>KeyPress</b> event for the particular character. The second
    form of pattern is longer but more general. It has the following syntax:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>&lt;</b><i>modifier-modifier-type-detail</i><b>&gt;</b></pre>
</div>
The entire event pattern is surrounded by angle brackets. Inside the angle
  brackets are zero or more modifiers, an event type, and an extra piece of
  information (<i>detail</i>) identifying a particular button or keysym. Any of
  the fields may be omitted, as long as at least one of <i>type</i> and
  <i>detail</i> is present. The fields must be separated by white space or
  dashes.
<p class="Pp">The third form of pattern is used to specify a user-defined, named
    virtual event. It has the following syntax:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>&lt;&lt;</b><i>name</i><b>&gt;&gt;</b></pre>
</div>
The entire virtual event pattern is surrounded by double angle brackets. Inside
  the angle brackets is the user-defined name of the virtual event. Modifiers,
  such as <b>Shift</b> or <b>Control</b>, may not be combined with a virtual
  event to modify it. Bindings on a virtual event may be created before the
  virtual event is defined, and if the definition of a virtual event changes
  dynamically, all windows bound to that virtual event will respond immediately
  to the new definition.
<p class="Pp">Some widgets (e.g. <b>menu</b> and <b>text</b>) issue virtual
    events when their internal state is updated in some ways. Please see the
    manual page for each widget for details.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="MODIFIERS"><a class="permalink" href="#MODIFIERS">MODIFIERS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Modifiers consist of any of the following values:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>Control</b>	<b>Mod1</b>, <b>M1</b>, <b>Command</b>
<b>Alt</b>	<b>Mod2</b>, <b>M2</b>, <b>Option</b>
<b>Shift</b>	<b>Mod3</b>, <b>M3</b>
<b>Lock</b>	<b>Mod4</b>, <b>M4</b>
<b>Extended</b>	<b>Mod5</b>, <b>M5</b>
<b>Button1</b>, <b>B1</b>	<b>Meta</b>, <b>M</b>
<b>Button2</b>, <b>B2</b>	<b>Double</b>
<b>Button3</b>, <b>B3</b>	<b>Triple</b>
<b>Button4</b>, <b>B4</b>	<b>Quadruple</b>
<b>Button5</b>, <b>B5</b></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Where more than one value is listed, separated by commas, the
    values are equivalent. Most of the modifiers have the obvious X meanings.
    For example, <b>Button1</b> requires that button 1 be depressed when the
    event occurs. For a binding to match a given event, the modifiers in the
    event must include all of those specified in the event pattern. An event may
    also contain additional modifiers not specified in the binding. For example,
    if button 1 is pressed while the shift and control keys are down, the
    pattern <b>&lt;Control-Button-1&gt;</b> will match the event, but
    <b>&lt;Mod1-Button-1&gt;</b> will not. If no modifiers are specified, then
    any combination of modifiers may be present in the event.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Meta</b> and <b>M</b> refer to whichever of the <b>M1</b>
    through <b>M5</b> modifiers is associated with the Meta key(s) on the
    keyboard (keysyms <b>Meta_R</b> and <b>Meta_L</b>). If there are no Meta
    keys, or if they are not associated with any modifiers, then <b>Meta</b> and
    <b>M</b> will not match any events. Similarly, the <b>Alt</b> modifier
    refers to whichever modifier is associated with the alt key(s) on the
    keyboard (keysyms <b>Alt_L</b> and <b>Alt_R</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>Double</b>, <b>Triple</b> and <b>Quadruple</b> modifiers
    are a convenience for specifying double mouse clicks and other repeated
    events. They cause a particular event pattern to be repeated 2, 3 or 4
    times, and also place a time and space requirement on the sequence: for a
    sequence of events to match a <b>Double</b>, <b>Triple</b> or
    <b>Quadruple</b> pattern, all of the events must occur close together in
    time and without substantial mouse motion in between. For example,
    <b>&lt;Double-Button-1&gt;</b> is equivalent to
    <b>&lt;Button-1&gt;&lt;Button-1&gt;</b> with the extra time and space
    requirement.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>Command</b> and <b>Option</b> modifiers are equivalents of
    <b>Mod1</b> resp. <b>Mod2</b>, they correspond to Macintosh-specific
    modifier keys.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>Extended</b> modifier is, at present, specific to Windows.
    It appears on events that are associated with the keys on the
    &#x201C;extended keyboard&#x201D;. On a US keyboard, the extended keys
    include the <b>Alt</b> and <b>Control</b> keys at the right of the keyboard,
    the cursor keys in the cluster to the left of the numeric pad, the
    <b>NumLock</b> key, the <b>Break</b> key, the <b>PrintScreen</b> key, and
    the <b>/</b> and <b>Enter</b> keys in the numeric keypad.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="EVENT_TYPES"><a class="permalink" href="#EVENT_TYPES">EVENT
  TYPES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <i>type</i> field may be any of the standard X event types,
    with a few extra abbreviations. The <i>type</i> field will also accept a
    couple non-standard X event types that were added to better support the
    Macintosh and Windows platforms. Below is a list of all the valid types;
    where two names appear together, they are synonyms.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>Activate</b>	<b>Destroy</b>	<b>Map</b>
<b>ButtonPress</b>, <b>Button</b>	<b>Enter</b>	<b>MapRequest</b>
<b>ButtonRelease</b>	<b>Expose</b>	<b>Motion</b>
<b>Circulate</b>	<b>FocusIn</b>	<b>MouseWheel</b>
<b>CirculateRequest</b>	<b>FocusOut</b>	<b>Property</b>
<b>Colormap</b>	<b>Gravity</b>	<b>Reparent</b>
<b>Configure</b>	<b>KeyPress</b>, <b>Key</b>	<b>ResizeRequest</b>
<b>ConfigureRequest</b>	<b>KeyRelease</b>	<b>Unmap</b>
<b>Create</b>	<b>Leave</b>	<b>Visibility</b>
<b>Deactivate</b></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Most of the above events have the same fields and behaviors as
    events in the X Windowing system. You can find more detailed descriptions of
    these events in any X window programming book. A couple of the events are
    extensions to the X event system to support features unique to the Macintosh
    and Windows platforms. We provide a little more detail on these events here.
    These include:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Activate"><a class="permalink" href="#Activate"><b>Activate</b>,
    <b>Deactivate</b></a></dt>
  <dd>These two events are sent to every sub-window of a toplevel when they
      change state. In addition to the focus Window, the Macintosh platform and
      Windows platforms have a notion of an active window (which often has but
      is not required to have the focus). On the Macintosh, widgets in the
      active window have a different appearance than widgets in deactive
      windows. The <b>Activate</b> event is sent to all the sub-windows in a
      toplevel when it changes from being deactive to active. Likewise, the
      <b>Deactive</b> event is sent when the window's state changes from active
      to deactive. There are no useful percent substitutions you would make when
      binding to these events.</dd>
  <dt id="MouseWheel"><a class="permalink" href="#MouseWheel"><b>MouseWheel</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Many contemporary mice support a mouse wheel, which is used for scrolling
      documents without using the scrollbars. By rolling the wheel, the system
      will generate <b>MouseWheel</b> events that the application can use to
      scroll. Like <b>Key</b> events the event is always routed to the window
      that currently has focus. When the event is received you can use the
      <b>%D</b> substitution to get the <i>delta</i> field for the event, which
      is a integer value describing how the mouse wheel has moved. The smallest
      value for which the system will report is defined by the OS. On Windows 95
      &amp; 98 machines this value is at least 120 before it is reported.
      However, higher resolution devices may be available in the future. The
      sign of the value determines which direction your widget should scroll.
      Positive values should scroll up and negative values should scroll
    down.</dd>
  <dt id="KeyPress"><a class="permalink" href="#KeyPress"><b>KeyPress</b>,
    <b>KeyRelease</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>KeyPress</b> and <b>KeyRelease</b> events are generated whenever a
      key is pressed or released. <b>KeyPress</b> and <b>KeyRelease</b> events
      are sent to the window which currently has the keyboard focus.</dd>
  <dt id="ButtonPress"><a class="permalink" href="#ButtonPress"><b>ButtonPress</b>,
    <b>ButtonRelease</b>, <b>Motion</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>ButtonPress</b> and <b>ButtonRelease</b> events are generated when
      the user presses or releases a mouse button. <b>Motion</b> events are
      generated whenever the pointer is moved. <b>ButtonPress</b>,
      <b>ButtonRelease</b>, and <b>Motion</b> events are normally sent to the
      window containing the pointer.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">When a mouse button is pressed, the window containing the pointer
    automatically obtains a temporary pointer grab. Subsequent
    <b>ButtonPress</b>, <b>ButtonRelease</b>, and <b>Motion</b> events will be
    sent to that window, regardless of which window contains the pointer, until
    all buttons have been released.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Configure"><a class="permalink" href="#Configure"><b>Configure</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A <b>Configure</b> event is sent to a window whenever its size, position,
      or border width changes, and sometimes when it has changed position in the
      stacking order.</dd>
  <dt id="Map"><a class="permalink" href="#Map"><b>Map</b>,
    <b>Unmap</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>Map</b> and <b>Unmap</b> events are generated whenever the mapping
      state of a window changes.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Windows are created in the unmapped state. Top-level windows
    become mapped when they transition to the <b>normal</b> state, and are
    unmapped in the <b>withdrawn</b> and <b>iconic</b> states. Other windows
    become mapped when they are placed under control of a geometry manager (for
    example <b>pack</b> or <b>grid</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">A window is <i>viewable</i> only if it and all of its ancestors
    are mapped. Note that geometry managers typically do not map their children
    until they have been mapped themselves, and unmap all children when they
    become unmapped; hence in Tk <b>Map</b> and <b>Unmap</b> events indicate
    whether or not a window is viewable.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Visibility"><a class="permalink" href="#Visibility"><b>Visibility</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A window is said to be <i>obscured</i> when another window above it in the
      stacking order fully or partially overlaps it. <b>Visibility</b> events
      are generated whenever a window's obscurity state changes; the
      <i>state</i> field (<b>%s</b>) specifies the new state.</dd>
  <dt id="Expose"><a class="permalink" href="#Expose"><b>Expose</b></a></dt>
  <dd>An <b>Expose</b> event is generated whenever all or part of a window
      should be redrawn (for example, when a window is first mapped or if it
      becomes unobscured). It is normally not necessary for client applications
      to handle <b>Expose</b> events, since Tk handles them internally.</dd>
  <dt id="Destroy"><a class="permalink" href="#Destroy"><b>Destroy</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A <b>Destroy</b> event is delivered to a window when it is destroyed.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">When the <b>Destroy</b> event is delivered to a widget, it is in a
    &#x201C;half-dead&#x201D; state: the widget still exists, but most
    operations on it will fail.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="FocusIn"><a class="permalink" href="#FocusIn"><b>FocusIn</b>,
    <b>FocusOut</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>FocusIn</b> and <b>FocusOut</b> events are generated whenever the
      keyboard focus changes. A <b>FocusOut</b> event is sent to the old focus
      window, and a <b>FocusIn</b> event is sent to the new one.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">In addition, if the old and new focus windows do not share a
    common parent, &#x201C;virtual crossing&#x201D; focus events are sent to the
    intermediate windows in the hierarchy. Thus a <b>FocusIn</b> event indicates
    that the target window or one of its descendants has acquired the focus, and
    a <b>FocusOut</b> event indicates that the focus has been changed to a
    window outside the target window's hierarchy.</p>
<p class="Pp">The keyboard focus may be changed explicitly by a call to
    <b>focus</b>, or implicitly by the window manager.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Enter"><a class="permalink" href="#Enter"><b>Enter</b>,
    <b>Leave</b></a></dt>
  <dd>An <b>Enter</b> event is sent to a window when the pointer enters that
      window, and a <b>Leave</b> event is sent when the pointer leaves it.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If there is a pointer grab in effect, <b>Enter</b> and
    <b>Leave</b> events are only delivered to the window owning the grab.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, when the pointer moves between two windows,
    <b>Enter</b> and <b>Leave</b> &#x201C;virtual crossing&#x201D; events are
    sent to intermediate windows in the hierarchy in the same manner as for
    <b>FocusIn</b> and <b>FocusOut</b> events.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Property"><a class="permalink" href="#Property"><b>Property</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A <b>Property</b> event is sent to a window whenever an X property
      belonging to that window is changed or deleted. <b>Property</b> events are

      core.</dd>
  <dt id="Colormap"><a class="permalink" href="#Colormap"><b>Colormap</b></a></dt>

      a window has been changed, installed, or uninstalled.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Widgets may be assigned a private colormap by specifying a

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">A <b>Circulate</b> event indicates that the window has moved to

    may be changed for other reasons which do not generate a <b>Circulate</b>
    event, and that Tk does not use <b>XCirculateSubwindows()</b> internally.

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="EVENT_DETAILS"><a class="permalink" href="#EVENT_DETAILS">EVENT
  DETAILS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The last part of a long event specification is <i>detail</i>. In
    the case of a <b>ButtonPress</b> or <b>ButtonRelease</b> event, it is the
    number of a button (1-5). If a button number is given, then only an event on
    that particular button will match; if no button number is given, then an
    event on any button will match. Note: giving a specific button number is
    different than specifying a button modifier; in the first case, it refers to
    a button being pressed or released, while in the second it refers to some
    other button that is already depressed when the matching event occurs. If a
    button number is given then <i>type</i> may be omitted: if will default to
    <b>ButtonPress</b>. For example, the specifier <b>&lt;1&gt;</b> is
    equivalent to <b>&lt;ButtonPress-1&gt;</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the event type is <b>KeyPress</b> or <b>KeyRelease</b>, then
    <i>detail</i> may be specified in the form of an X keysym. Keysyms are
    textual specifications for particular keys on the keyboard; they include all
    the alphanumeric ASCII characters (e.g. &#x201C;a&#x201D; is the keysym for
    the ASCII character &#x201C;a&#x201D;), plus descriptions for
    non-alphanumeric characters (&#x201C;comma&#x201D;is the keysym for the
    comma character), plus descriptions for all the non-ASCII keys on the
    keyboard (e.g. &#x201C;Shift_L&#x201D; is the keysym for the left shift key,
    and &#x201C;F1&#x201D; is the keysym for the F1 function key, if it exists).
    The complete list of keysyms is not presented here; it is available in other
    X documentation and may vary from system to system. If necessary, you can
    use the <b>%K</b> notation described below to print out the keysym name for
    a particular key. If a keysym <i>detail</i> is given, then the <i>type</i>
    field may be omitted; it will default to <b>KeyPress</b>. For example,
    <b>&lt;Control-comma&gt;</b> is equivalent to
    <b>&lt;Control-KeyPress-comma&gt;</b>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BINDING_SCRIPTS_AND_SUBSTITUTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#BINDING_SCRIPTS_AND_SUBSTITUTIONS">BINDING
  SCRIPTS AND SUBSTITUTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>script</i> argument to <b>bind</b> is a Tcl script, which
    will be executed whenever the given event sequence occurs. <i>Command</i>
    will be executed in the same interpreter that the <b>bind</b> command was
    executed in, and it will run at global level (only global variables will be
    accessible). If <i>script</i> contains any <b>%</b> characters, then the
    script will not be executed directly. Instead, a new script will be
    generated by replacing each <b>%</b>, and the character following it, with
    information from the current event. The replacement depends on the character
    following the <b>%</b>, as defined in the list below. Unless otherwise
    indicated, the replacement string is the decimal value of the given field
    from the current event. Some of the substitutions are only valid for certain
    types of events; if they are used for other types of events the value
    substituted is undefined.</p>

<p class="Pp">The replacement string for a %-replacement is formatted as a
    proper Tcl list element. This means that spaces or special characters such
    as <b>$</b> and <b>{</b> may be preceded by backslashes. This guarantees
    that the string will be passed through the Tcl parser when the binding
    script is evaluated. Most replacements are numbers or well-defined strings
    such as <b>Above</b>; for these replacements no special formatting is ever
    necessary. The most common case where reformatting occurs is for the
    <b>%A</b> substitution. For example, if <i>script</i> is</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>insert&#x00A0;%A</b></pre>
</div>
and the character typed is an open square bracket, then the script actually
  executed will be
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>insert&#x00A0;\[</b></pre>
</div>
This will cause the <b>insert</b> to receive the original replacement string
  (open square bracket) as its first argument. If the extra backslash had not
  been added, Tcl would not have been able to parse the script correctly.

<h1 class="Sh" id="MULTIPLE_MATCHES"><a class="permalink" href="#MULTIPLE_MATCHES">MULTIPLE
  MATCHES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">It is possible for several bindings to match a given X event. If
    the bindings are associated with different <i>tag</i>'s, then each of the
    bindings will be executed, in order. By default, a binding for the widget
    will be executed first, followed by a class binding, a binding for its
    toplevel, and an <b>all</b> binding. The <b>bindtags</b> command may be used
    to change this order for a particular window or to associate additional
    binding tags with the window.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>continue</b> and <b>break</b> commands may be used inside a
    binding script to control the processing of matching scripts. If
    <b>continue</b> is invoked, then the current binding script is terminated
    but Tk will continue processing binding scripts associated with other
    <i>tag</i>'s. If the <b>break</b> command is invoked within a binding
    script, then that script terminates and no other scripts will be invoked for
    the event.</p>
<p class="Pp">If more than one binding matches a particular event and they have
    the same <i>tag</i>, then the most specific binding is chosen and its script
    is evaluated. The following tests are applied, in order, to determine which
    of several matching sequences is more specific:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(a)</dt>
  <dd>an event pattern that specifies a specific button or key is more specific
      than one that does not;</dd>
  <dt>(b)</dt>
  <dd>a longer sequence (in terms of number of events matched) is more specific
      than a shorter sequence;</dd>
  <dt>(c)</dt>
  <dd>if the modifiers specified in one pattern are a subset of the modifiers in
      another pattern, then the pattern with more modifiers is more
    specific.</dd>
  <dt>(d)</dt>
  <dd>a virtual event whose physical pattern matches the sequence is less
      specific than the same physical pattern that is not associated with a
      virtual event.</dd>
  <dt>(e)</dt>
  <dd>given a sequence that matches two or more virtual events, one of the
      virtual events will be chosen, but the order is undefined.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the matching sequences contain more than one event, then tests
    (c)-(e) are applied in order from the most recent event to the least recent
    event in the sequences. If these tests fail to determine a winner, then the
    most recently registered sequence is the winner.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there are two (or more) virtual events that are both triggered
    by the same sequence, and both of those virtual events are bound to the same
    window tag, then only one of the virtual events will be triggered, and it
    will be picked at random:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
event add &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; &lt;Control-y&gt;
event add &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; &lt;Button-2&gt;
event add &lt;&lt;Scroll&gt;&gt; &lt;Button-2&gt;
<b>bind</b> Entry &lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt; {puts Paste}
<b>bind</b> Entry &lt;&lt;Scroll&gt;&gt; {puts Scroll}</pre>
</div>
If the user types Control-y, the <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b> binding will be
  invoked, but if the user presses button 2 then one of either the
  <b>&lt;&lt;Paste&gt;&gt;</b> or the <b>&lt;&lt;Scroll&gt;&gt;</b> bindings
  will be invoked, but exactly which one gets invoked is undefined.
<p class="Pp">If an X event does not match any of the existing bindings, then
    the event is ignored. An unbound event is not considered to be an error.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="MULTI-EVENT_SEQUENCES_AND_IGNORED_EVENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#MULTI-EVENT_SEQUENCES_AND_IGNORED_EVENTS">MULTI-EVENT
  SEQUENCES AND IGNORED EVENTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When a <i>sequence</i> specified in a <b>bind</b> command contains
    more than one event pattern, then its script is executed whenever the recent
    events (leading up to and including the current event) match the given
    sequence. This means, for example, that if button 1 is clicked repeatedly
    the sequence <b>&lt;Double-ButtonPress-1&gt;</b> will match each button
    press but the first. If extraneous events that would prevent a match occur
    in the middle of an event sequence then the extraneous events are ignored
    unless they are <b>KeyPress</b> or <b>ButtonPress</b> events. For example,
    <b>&lt;Double-ButtonPress-1&gt;</b> will match a sequence of presses of
    button 1, even though there will be <b>ButtonRelease</b> events (and
    possibly <b>Motion</b> events) between the <b>ButtonPress</b> events.
    Furthermore, a <b>KeyPress</b> event may be preceded by any number of other
    <b>KeyPress</b> events for modifier keys without the modifier keys
    preventing a match. For example, the event sequence <b>aB</b> will match a
    press of the <b>a</b> key, a release of the <b>a</b> key, a press of the
    <b>Shift</b> key, and a press of the <b>b</b> key: the press of <b>Shift</b>
    is ignored because it is a modifier key. Finally, if several <b>Motion</b>
    events occur in a row, only the last one is used for purposes of matching
    binding sequences.</p>

<p class="Pp">If an error occurs in executing the script for a binding then the
