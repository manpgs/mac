   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">The <b>proc</b> command creates a new Tcl procedure named
    <i>name</i>, replacing any existing command or procedure there may have been
    by that name. Whenever the new command is invoked, the contents of
    <i>body</i> will be executed by the Tcl interpreter. Normally, <i>name</i>
    is unqualified (does not include the names of any containing namespaces),
    and the new procedure is created in the current namespace. If <i>name</i>
    includes any namespace qualifiers, the procedure is created in the specified
    namespace. <i>Args</i> specifies the formal arguments to the procedure. It
    consists of a list, possibly empty, each of whose elements specifies one
    argument. Each argument specifier is also a list with either one or two
    fields. If there is only a single field in the specifier then it is the name
    of the argument; if there are two fields, then the first is the argument
    name and the second is its default value. Arguments with default values that
    are followed by non-defaulted arguments become required arguments. In 8.6
    this will be considered an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>name</i> is invoked a local variable will be created for
    each of the formal arguments to the procedure; its value will be the value
    of corresponding argument in the invoking command or the argument's default
    value. Actual arguments are assigned to formal arguments strictly in order.
    Arguments with default values need not be specified in a procedure
    invocation. However, there must be enough actual arguments for all the
    formal arguments that do not have defaults, and there must not be any extra
    actual arguments. Arguments with default values that are followed by
    non-defaulted arguments become required arguments (in 8.6 it will be
    considered an error). There is one special case to permit procedures with
    variable numbers of arguments. If the last formal argument has the name
    <b>args</b>, then a call to the procedure may contain more actual arguments
    than the procedure has formals. In this case, all of the actual arguments
    starting at the one that would be assigned to <b>args</b> are combined into
    a list (as if the <b>list</b> command had been used); this combined value is
    assigned to the local variable <b>args</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>body</i> is being executed, variable names normally refer
    to local variables, which are created automatically when referenced and
    deleted when the procedure returns. One local variable is automatically
    created for each of the procedure's arguments. Other variables can only be
    accessed by invoking one of the <b>global</b>, <b>variable</b>, <b>upvar</b>
    or <b>namespace upvar</b> commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>proc</b> command returns an empty string. When a procedure
    is invoked, the procedure's return value is the value specified in a
    <b>return</b> command. If the procedure does not execute an explicit
    <b>return</b>, then its return value is the value of the last command
    executed in the procedure's body. If an error occurs while executing the
    procedure body, then the procedure-as-a-whole will return that same
  error.</p>
