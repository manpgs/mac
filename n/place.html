   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">The placer is a geometry manager for Tk. It provides simple fixed
    placement of windows, where you specify the exact size and location of one
    window, called the <i>slave</i>, within another window, called the
    <i>master</i>. The placer also provides rubber-sheet placement, where you
    specify the size and location of the slave in terms of the dimensions of the
    master, so that the slave changes size and location in response to changes
    in the size of the master. Lastly, the placer allows you to mix these styles
    of placement so that, for example, the slave has a fixed width and height
    but is centered inside the master.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="place"><a class="permalink" href="#place"><b>place </b><i>window
    option value </i>?<i>option value ...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Arrange for the placer to manage the geometry of a slave whose pathName is
      <i>window</i>. The remaining arguments consist of one or more
      <i>option-value</i> pairs that specify the way in which <i>window</i>'s
      geometry is managed. <i>Option</i> may have any of the values accepted by
      the <b>place configure</b> command.</dd>
  <dt id="place~2"><a class="permalink" href="#place~2"><b>place configure
    </b><i>window </i>?<i>option</i>? ?<i>value option value ...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Query or modify the geometry options of the slave given by <i>window</i>.
      If no <i>option</i> is specified, this command returns a list describing
      the available options (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information on the
      format of this list). If <i>option</i> is specified with no <i>value</i>,
      then the command returns a list describing the one named option (this list
      will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
      <i>option</i> is specified). If one or more <i>option-value</i> pairs are
      specified, then the command modifies the given option(s) to have the given
      value(s); in this case the command returns an empty string.
    <p class="Pp">The following <i>option-value</i> pairs are supported:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="anchor"><a class="permalink" href="#anchor"><b>-anchor
    </b><i>where</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Where</i> specifies which point of <i>window</i> is to be positioned at
      the (x,y) location selected by the <b>-x</b>, <b>-y</b>, <b>-relx</b>, and
      <b>-rely</b> options. The anchor point is in terms of the outer area of
      <i>window</i> including its border, if any. Thus if <i>where</i> is
      <b>se</b> then the lower-right corner of <i>window</i>'s border will
      appear at the given (x,y) location in the master. The anchor position
      defaults to <b>nw</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="bordermode"><a class="permalink" href="#bordermode"><b>-bordermode
    </b><i>mode</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Mode</i> determines the degree to which borders within the master are
      used in determining the placement of the slave. The default and most
      common value is <b>inside</b>. In this case the placer considers the area
      of the master to be the innermost area of the master, inside any border:
      an option of <b>-x 0</b> corresponds to an x-coordinate just inside the
      border and an option of <b>-relwidth 1.0</b> means <i>window</i> will fill
      the area inside the master's border.
    <p class="Pp">If <i>mode</i> is <b>outside</b> then the placer considers the
        area of the master to include its border; this mode is typically used
        when placing <i>window</i> outside its master, as with the options <b>-x
        0 -y 0 -anchor ne</b>. Lastly, <i>mode</i> may be specified as
        <b>ignore</b>, in which case borders are ignored: the area of the master
        is considered to be its official X area, which includes any internal
        border but no external border. A bordermode of <b>ignore</b> is probably
        not very useful.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="height"><a class="permalink" href="#height"><b>-height
    </b><i>size</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Size</i> specifies the height for <i>window</i> in screen units (i.e.
      any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>). The height will be the
      outer dimension of <i>window</i> including its border, if any. If
      <i>size</i> is an empty string, or if no <b>-height</b> or
      <b>-relheight</b> option is specified, then the height requested
      internally by the window will be used.</dd>
  <dt id="in"><a class="permalink" href="#in"><b>-in </b><i>master</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Master</i> specifies the path name of the window relative to which
      <i>window</i> is to be placed. <i>Master</i> must either be
      <i>window</i>'s parent or a descendant of <i>window</i>'s parent. In
      addition, <i>master</i> and <i>window</i> must both be descendants of the
      same top-level window. These restrictions are necessary to guarantee that
      <i>window</i> is visible whenever <i>master</i> is visible. If this option
      is not specified then the master defaults to <i>window</i>'s parent.</dd>
  <dt id="relheight"><a class="permalink" href="#relheight"><b>-relheight
    </b><i>size</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Size</i> specifies the height for <i>window</i>. In this case the
      height is specified as a floating-point number relative to the height of
      the master: 0.5 means <i>window</i> will be half as high as the master,
      1.0 means <i>window</i> will have the same height as the master, and so
      on. If both <b>-height</b> and <b>-relheight</b> are specified for a
      slave, their values are summed. For example, <b>-relheight 1.0 -height
      -2</b> makes the slave 2 pixels shorter than the master.</dd>
  <dt id="relwidth"><a class="permalink" href="#relwidth"><b>-relwidth
    </b><i>size</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Size</i> specifies the width for <i>window</i>. In this case the width
      is specified as a floating-point number relative to the width of the
      master: 0.5 means <i>window</i> will be half as wide as the master, 1.0
      means <i>window</i> will have the same width as the master, and so on. If
      both <b>-width</b> and <b>-relwidth</b> are specified for a slave, their
      values are summed. For example, <b>-relwidth 1.0 -width 5</b> makes the
      slave 5 pixels wider than the master.</dd>
  <dt id="relx"><a class="permalink" href="#relx"><b>-relx
    </b><i>location</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Location</i> specifies the x-coordinate within the master window of the
      anchor point for <i>window</i>. In this case the location is specified in
      a relative fashion as a floating-point number: 0.0 corresponds to the left
      edge of the master and 1.0 corresponds to the right edge of the master.
      <i>Location</i> need not be in the range 0.0-1.0. If both <b>-x</b> and
      <b>-relx</b> are specified for a slave then their values are summed. For
      example, <b>-relx 0.5 -x -2</b> positions the left edge of the slave 2
      pixels to the left of the center of its master.</dd>
  <dt id="rely"><a class="permalink" href="#rely"><b>-rely
    </b><i>location</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Location</i> specifies the y-coordinate within the master window of the
      anchor point for <i>window</i>. In this case the value is specified in a
      relative fashion as a floating-point number: 0.0 corresponds to the top
      edge of the master and 1.0 corresponds to the bottom edge of the master.
      <i>Location</i> need not be in the range 0.0-1.0. If both <b>-y</b> and
      <b>-rely</b> are specified for a slave then their values are summed. For
      example, <b>-rely 0.5 -x 3</b> positions the top edge of the slave 3
      pixels below the center of its master.</dd>
  <dt id="width"><a class="permalink" href="#width"><b>-width
    </b><i>size</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Size</i> specifies the width for <i>window</i> in screen units (i.e.
      any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>). The width will be the
      outer width of <i>window</i> including its border, if any. If <i>size</i>
      is an empty string, or if no <b>-width</b> or <b>-relwidth</b> option is
      specified, then the width requested internally by the window will be
    used.</dd>
  <dt id="x"><a class="permalink" href="#x"><b>-x </b><i>location</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Location</i> specifies the x-coordinate within the master window of the
      anchor point for <i>window</i>. The location is specified in screen units
      (i.e. any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>) and need not lie
      within the bounds of the master window.</dd>
  <dt id="y"><a class="permalink" href="#y"><b>-y </b><i>location</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Location</i> specifies the y-coordinate within the master window of the
      anchor point for <i>window</i>. The location is specified in screen units
      (i.e. any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>) and need not lie
      within the bounds of the master window.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If the same value is specified separately with two different
    options, such as <b>-x</b> and <b>-relx</b>, then the most recent option is
    used and the older one is ignored.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="place~3"><a class="permalink" href="#place~3"><b>place forget
    </b><i>window</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Causes the placer to stop managing the geometry of <i>window</i>. As a
      side effect of this command <i>window</i> will be unmapped so that it does
      not appear on the screen. If <i>window</i> is not currently managed by the
      placer then the command has no effect. This command returns an empty
      string.</dd>
  <dt id="place~4"><a class="permalink" href="#place~4"><b>place info
    </b><i>window</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns a list giving the current configuration of <i>window</i>. The list
      consists of <i>option-value</i> pairs in exactly the same form as might be
      specified to the <b>place configure</b> command.</dd>
  <dt id="place~5"><a class="permalink" href="#place~5"><b>place slaves
    </b><i>window</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns a list of all the slave windows for which <i>window</i> is the
      master. If there are no slaves for <i>window</i> then an empty string is
      returned.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If the configuration of a window has been retrieved with <b>place
    info</b>, that configuration can be restored later by first using <b>place
    forget</b> to erase any existing information for the window and then
    invoking <b>place configure</b> with the saved information.</p>

  POINTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">It is not necessary for the master window to be the parent of the
    slave window. This feature is useful in at least two situations. First, for
    complex window layouts it means you can create a hierarchy of subwindows
    whose only purpose is to assist in the layout of the parent. The
    &#x201C;real children&#x201D; of the parent (i.e. the windows that are
    significant for the application's user interface) can be children of the
    parent yet be placed inside the windows of the geometry-management
    hierarchy. This means that the path names of the &#x201C;real
    children&#x201D; do not reflect the geometry-management hierarchy and users
    can specify options for the real children without being aware of the
    structure of the geometry-management hierarchy.</p>
<p class="Pp">A second reason for having a master different than the slave's
    parent is to tie two siblings together. For example, the placer can be used
    to force a window always to be positioned centered just below one of its
    siblings by specifying the configuration</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>-in </b><i>sibling</i><b> -relx 0.5 -rely 1.0 -anchor n -bordermode outside</b></pre>
</div>
Whenever the sibling is repositioned in the future, the slave will be
  repositioned as well.
<p class="Pp">Unlike many other geometry managers (such as the packer) the
    placer does not make any attempt to manipulate the geometry of the master
    windows or the parents of slave windows (i.e. it does not set their
    requested sizes). To control the sizes of these windows, make them windows
    like frames and canvases that provide configuration options for this
    purpose.</p>
