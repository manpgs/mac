   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">This command is invoked by the Tcl interpreter whenever a script
    tries to invoke a command that does not exist. The default implementation of
    <b>unknown</b> is a library procedure defined when Tcl initializes an
    interpreter. You can override the default <b>unknown</b> to change its
    functionality, or you can register a new handler for individual namespaces
    using the <b>namespace unknown</b> command. Note that there is no default
    implementation of <b>unknown</b> in a safe interpreter.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the Tcl interpreter encounters a command name for which there
    is not a defined command (in either the current namespace, or the global
    namespace), then Tcl checks for the existence of an unknown handler for the
    current namespace. By default, this handler is a command named
    <b>::unknown</b>. If there is no such command, then the interpreter returns
    an error. If the <b>unknown</b> command exists (or a new handler has been
    registered for the current namespace), then it is invoked with arguments
    consisting of the fully-substituted name and arguments for the original
    non-existent command. The <b>unknown</b> command typically does things like
    searching through library directories for a command procedure with the name
    <i>cmdName</i>, or expanding abbreviated command names to full-length, or
    automatically executing unknown commands as sub-processes. In some cases
    (such as expanding abbreviations) <b>unknown</b> will change the original
    command slightly and then (re-)execute it. The result of the <b>unknown</b>
    command is used as the result for the original non-existent command.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default implementation of <b>unknown</b> behaves as follows.
    It first calls the <b>auto_load</b> library procedure to load the command.
    If this succeeds, then it executes the original command with its original
    arguments. If the auto-load fails then <b>unknown</b> calls
    <b>auto_execok</b> to see if there is an executable file by the name
    <i>cmd</i>. If so, it invokes the Tcl <b>exec</b> command with <i>cmd</i>
    and all the <i>args</i> as arguments. If <i>cmd</i> cannot be auto-executed,
    <b>unknown</b> checks to see if the command was invoked at top-level and
    outside of any script. If so, then <b>unknown</b> takes two additional
    steps. First, it sees if <i>cmd</i> has one of the following three forms:
    <b>!!</b>, <b>!</b><i>event</i>, or
    <b>^</b><i>old</i><b>^</b><i>new</i>?<b>^</b>?. If so, then <b>unknown</b>
    carries out history substitution in the same way that <b>csh</b> would for
    these constructs. Finally, <b>unknown</b> checks to see if <i>cmd</i> is a
    unique abbreviation for an existing Tcl command. If so, it expands the
    command name and executes the command with the original arguments. If none
    of the above efforts has been able to execute the command, <b>unknown</b>
    generates an error return. If the global variable <b>auto_noload</b> is
    defined, then the auto-load step is skipped. If the global variable
    <b>auto_noexec</b> is defined then the auto-exec step is skipped. Under
    normal circumstances the return value from <b>unknown</b> is the return
    value from the command that was eventually executed.</p>
