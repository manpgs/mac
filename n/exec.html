   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">This command treats its arguments as the specification of one or
    more subprocesses to execute. The arguments take the form of a standard
    shell pipeline where each <i>arg</i> becomes one word of a command, and each
    distinct command becomes a subprocess.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the initial arguments to <b>exec</b> start with <b>-</b> then
    they are treated as command-line switches and are not part of the pipeline
    specification. The following switches are currently supported:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="ignorestderr"><a class="permalink" href="#ignorestderr"><b>-ignorestderr</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Stops the <b>exec</b> command from treating the output of messages to the
      pipeline's standard error channel as an error case.</dd>
  <dt id="keepnewline"><a class="permalink" href="#keepnewline"><b>-keepnewline</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Retains a trailing newline in the pipeline's output. Normally a trailing
      newline will be deleted.</dd>
  <dt><b>--</b></dt>
  <dd>Marks the end of switches. The argument following this one will be treated
      as the first <i>arg</i> even if it starts with a <b>-</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If an <i>arg</i> (or pair of <i>arg</i>s) has one of the forms
    described below then it is used by <b>exec</b> to control the flow of input
    and output among the subprocess(es). Such arguments will not be passed to
    the subprocess(es). In forms such as &#x201C;<b>&lt;</b>
    <i>fileName</i>&#x201D;, <i>fileName</i> may either be in a separate
    argument from &#x201C;<b>&lt;</b>&#x201D; or in the same argument with no
    intervening space (i.e. &#x201C;<b>&lt;</b><i>fileName</i>&#x201D;).</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>Separates distinct commands in the pipeline. Both standard output and
      standard error of the preceding command will be piped into the standard

  <dd><i>FileId</i> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return
      value from a previous call to <b>open</b>. It is used as the standard

      opened for reading.</dd>

      rather than overwriting it.</dd>
  <dt><b>&gt;@&#x00A0;</b><i>fileId</i></dt>
  <dd><i>FileId</i> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return
      value from a previous call to <b>open</b>. Standard output from the last
      command is redirected to <i>fileId</i>'s file, which must have been opened
      for writing.</dd>
  <dt><b>2&gt;@&#x00A0;</b><i>fileId</i></dt>
  <dd><i>FileId</i> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return
      value from a previous call to <b>open</b>. Standard error from all
      commands in the pipeline is redirected to <i>fileId</i>'s file. The file
      must have been opened for writing.</dd>
  <dt><b>2&gt;@1&#x00A0;</b></dt>
  <dd>Standard error from all commands in the pipeline is redirected to the
      command result. This operator is only valid at the end of the command
      pipeline.</dd>
  <dt><b>&gt;&amp;@&#x00A0;</b><i>fileId</i></dt>
  <dd><i>FileId</i> must be the identifier for an open file, such as the return
      value from a previous call to <b>open</b>. Both standard output from the
      last command and standard error from all commands are redirected to
      <i>fileId</i>'s file. The file must have been opened for writing.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If standard output has not been redirected then the <b>exec</b>
    command returns the standard output from the last command in the pipeline,
    unless &#x201C;2&gt;@1&#x201D; was specified, in which case standard error
    is included as well. If any of the commands in the pipeline exit abnormally
    or are killed or suspended, then <b>exec</b> will return an error and the
    error message will include the pipeline's output followed by error messages
    describing the abnormal terminations; the <b>-errorcode</b> return option
    will contain additional information about the last abnormal termination
    encountered. If any of the commands writes to its standard error file and
    that standard error is not redirected and <b>-ignorestderr</b> is not
    specified, then <b>exec</b> will return an error; the error message will
    include the pipeline's standard output, followed by messages about abnormal
    terminations (if any), followed by the standard error output.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the last character of the result or error message is a newline
    then that character is normally deleted from the result or error message.
    This is consistent with other Tcl return values, which do not normally end
    with newlines. However, if <b>-keepnewline</b> is specified then the
    trailing newline is retained.</p>
<p class="Pp">If standard input is not redirected with &#x201C;&lt;&#x201D;,
    &#x201C;&lt;&lt;&#x201D; or &#x201C;&lt;@&#x201D; then the standard input
    for the first command in the pipeline is taken from the application's
    current standard input.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the last <i>arg</i> is &#x201C;&amp;&#x201D; then the pipeline
    will be executed in background. In this case the <b>exec</b> command will
    return a list whose elements are the process identifiers for all of the
    subprocesses in the pipeline. The standard output from the last command in
    the pipeline will go to the application's standard output if it has not been
    redirected, and error output from all of the commands in the pipeline will
    go to the application's standard error file unless redirected.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first word in each command is taken as the command name;
    tilde-substitution is performed on it, and if the result contains no slashes
    then the directories in the PATH environment variable are searched for an
    executable by the given name. If the name contains a slash then it must
    refer to an executable reachable from the current directory. No
    &#x201C;glob&#x201D; expansion or other shell-like substitutions are
    performed on the arguments to commands.</p>

  <dd>Reading from or writing to a socket, using the
      &#x201C;<b>@&#x00A0;</b><i>fileId</i>&#x201D; notation, does not work.
      When reading from a socket, a 16-bit DOS application will hang and a
      32-bit application will return immediately with end-of-file. When either
      type of application writes to a socket, the information is instead sent to
      the console, if one is present, or is discarded.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The Tk console text widget does not provide real standard IO
    capabilities. Under Tk, when redirecting from standard input, all
    applications will see an immediate end-of-file; information redirected to
    standard output or standard error will be discarded.</p>
<p class="Pp">Either forward or backward slashes are accepted as path separators
    for arguments to Tcl commands. When executing an application, the path name
    specified for the application may also contain forward or backward slashes
    as path separators. Bear in mind, however, that most Windows applications
    accept arguments with forward slashes only as option delimiters and
    backslashes only in paths. Any arguments to an application that specify a
    path name with forward slashes will not automatically be converted to use
    the backslash character. If an argument contains forward slashes as the path
    separator, it may or may not be recognized as a path name, depending on the
    program.</p>
<p class="Pp">Additionally, when calling a 16-bit DOS or Windows 3.X
    application, all path names must use the short, cryptic, path format (e.g.,
    using &#x201C;applba~1.def&#x201D; instead of
    &#x201C;applbakery.default&#x201D;), which can be obtained with the
    &#x201C;<b>file attributes </b><i>fileName </i><b>-shortname</b>&#x201D;
    command.</p>
<p class="Pp">Two or more forward or backward slashes in a row in a path refer
    to a network path. For example, a simple concatenation of the root directory
    <b>c:/</b> with a subdirectory <b>/windows/system</b> will yield
    <b>c://windows/system</b> (two slashes together), which refers to the mount
    point called <b>system</b> on the machine called <b>windows</b> (and the
    <b>c:/</b> is ignored), and is not equivalent to <b>c:/windows/system</b>,
    which describes a directory on the current computer. The <b>file join</b>
    command should be used to concatenate path components.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that there are two general types of Win32 console
    applications:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>CLI &#x2014; CommandLine Interface, simple stdio exchange.
      <b>netstat.exe</b> for example.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>TUI &#x2014; Textmode User Interface, any application that accesses the
      console API for doing such things as cursor movement, setting text color,
      detecting key presses and mouse movement, etc. An example would be
      <b>telnet.exe</b> from Windows 2000. These types of applications are not
      common in a windows environment, but do exist.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>exec</b> will not work well with TUI applications when a
    console is not present, as is done when launching applications under wish.
    It is desirable to have console applications hidden and detached. This is a
    designed-in limitation as <b>exec</b> wants to communicate over pipes. The
    Expect extension addresses this issue when communicating with a TUI
    application.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Windows~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Windows~2"><b>Windows

  <dd>When attempting to execute an application, <b>exec</b> first searches for
      the name as it was specified. Then, in order, <b>.com</b>, <b>.exe</b>,
      and <b>.bat</b> are appended to the end of the specified name and it
      searches for the longer name. If a directory name was not specified as
      part of the application name, the following directories are automatically
      searched in order when attempting to locate the application:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">

    <b>copy</b>, the caller must prepend the desired command with
    &#x201C;<b>cmd.exe /c&#x00A0;</b>&#x201D; because built-in commands are not
    implemented using executables.</p>

    not implemented using executables.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once a 16-bit DOS application has read standard input from a
    console and then quit, all subsequently run 16-bit DOS applications will see
    the standard input as already closed. 32-bit applications do not have this
    problem and will run correctly, even after a 16-bit DOS application thinks
    that standard input is closed. There is no known workaround for this bug at
    this time.</p>
<p class="Pp">Redirection between the <b>NUL:</b> device and a 16-bit
    application does not always work. When redirecting from <b>NUL:</b>, some
    applications may hang, others will get an infinite stream of
    &#x201C;0x01&#x201D; bytes, and some will actually correctly get an
    immediate end-of-file; the behavior seems to depend upon something compiled
    into the application itself. When redirecting greater than 4K or so to
    <b>NUL:</b>, some applications will hang. The above problems do not happen
    with 32-bit applications.</p>
<p class="Pp">All DOS 16-bit applications are run synchronously. All standard
    input from a pipe to a 16-bit DOS application is collected into a temporary
    file; the other end of the pipe must be closed before the 16-bit DOS
    application begins executing. All standard output or error from a 16-bit DOS
    application to a pipe is collected into temporary files; the application
    must terminate before the temporary files are redirected to the next stage
    of the pipeline. This is due to a workaround for a Windows 95 bug in the
    implementation of pipes, and is how the standard Windows 95 DOS shell
    handles pipes itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">Certain applications, such as <b>command.com</b>, should not be
    executed interactively. Applications which directly access the console
    window, rather than reading from their standard input and writing to their
    standard output may fail, hang Tcl, or even hang the system if their own
    private console window is not available to them.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="UNIX_EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#UNIX_EXAMPLES">UNIX
  EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Here are some examples of the use of the <b>exec</b> command on
    Unix.</p>
<p class="Pp">To execute a simple program and get its result:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>exec</b> uname -a</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">To execute a program that can return a non-zero result, you should
    wrap the call to <b>exec</b> in <b>catch</b> and check the contents of the
    <b>-errorcode</b> return option if you have an error:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
set status 0
if {[catch {<b>exec</b> grep foo bar.txt} results options]} {
   set details [dict get $options -errorcode]
   if {[lindex $details 0] eq &quot;CHILDSTATUS&quot;} {
      set status [lindex $details 2]
   } else {
      # Some kind of unexpected failure
   }
}</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">When translating a command from a Unix shell invocation, care
    should be taken over the fact that single quote characters have no special
    significance to Tcl. Thus:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}' numbers.list</pre>
</div>
would be translated into something like:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>exec</b> awk {{sum += $1} END {print sum}} numbers.list</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If you are converting invocations involving shell globbing, you
    should remember that Tcl does not handle globbing or expand things into
    multiple arguments by default. Instead you should write things like
  this:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>exec</b> ls -l {*}[glob *.tcl]</pre>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="WINDOWS_EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#WINDOWS_EXAMPLES">WINDOWS
  EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Here are some examples of the use of the <b>exec</b> command on
    Windows.</p>
<p class="Pp">To start an instance of <i>notepad</i> editing a file without
    waiting for the user to finish editing the file:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>exec</b> notepad myfile.txt &amp;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">To print a text file using <i>notepad</i>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>exec</b> notepad /p myfile.txt</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If a program calls other programs, such as is common with
    compilers, then you may need to resort to batch files to hide the console
    windows that sometimes pop up:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>exec</b> cmp.bat somefile.c -o somefile</pre>
</div>
With the file <i>cmp.bat</i> looking something like:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
@gcc %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes you need to be careful, as different programs may have
    the same name and be in the path. It can then happen that typing a command
    at the DOS prompt finds <i>a different program</i> than the same command run
    via <b>exec</b>. This is because of the (documented) differences in
    behaviour between <b>exec</b> and DOS batch files.</p>
<p class="Pp">When in doubt, use the command <b>auto_execok</b>: it will return
    the complete path to the program as seen by the <b>exec</b> command. This
    applies especially when you want to run &#x201C;internal&#x201D; commands
    like <i>dir</i> from a Tcl script (if you just want to list filenames, use
    the <b>glob</b> command.) To do that, use this:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>exec</b> {*}[auto_execok dir] *.tcl</pre>
