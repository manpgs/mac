   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">This command opens a network socket and returns a channel
    identifier that may be used in future invocations of commands like
    <b>read</b>, <b>puts</b> and <b>flush</b>. At present only the TCP network
    protocol is supported; future releases may include support for additional
    protocols. The <b>socket</b> command may be used to open either the client
    or server side of a connection, depending on whether the <b>-server</b>
    switch is specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the default encoding for <i>all</i> sockets is the
    system encoding, as returned by <b>encoding system</b>. Most of the time,
    you will need to use <b>fconfigure</b> to alter this to something else, such
    as <i>utf-8</i> (ideal for communicating with other Tcl processes) or
    <i>iso8859-1</i> (useful for many network protocols, especially the older
    ones).</p>

<p class="Pp">If the <b>-server</b> option is not specified, then the client
    side of a connection is opened and the command returns a channel identifier
    that can be used for both reading and writing. <i>Port</i> and <i>host</i>
    specify a port to connect to; there must be a server accepting connections
    on this port. <i>Port</i> is an integer port number (or service name, where
    supported and understood by the host operating system) and <i>host</i> is
    either a domain-style name such as <b>www.tcl.tk</b> or a numerical IP
    address such as <b>127.0.0.1</b>. Use <i>localhost</i> to refer to the host
    on which the command is invoked.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following options may also be present before <i>host</i> to
    specify additional information about the connection:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="myaddr"><a class="permalink" href="#myaddr"><b>-myaddr</b><i>
    addr</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Addr</i> gives the domain-style name or numerical IP address of the
      client-side network interface to use for the connection. This option may
      be useful if the client machine has multiple network interfaces. If the
      option is omitted then the client-side interface will be chosen by the
      system software.</dd>
  <dt id="myport"><a class="permalink" href="#myport"><b>-myport</b><i>
    port</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Port</i> specifies an integer port number (or service name, where
      supported and understood by the host operating system) to use for the
      client's side of the connection. If this option is omitted, the client's
      port number will be chosen at random by the system software.</dd>
  <dt id="async"><a class="permalink" href="#async"><b>-async</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>-async</b> option will cause the client socket to be connected
      asynchronously. This means that the socket will be created immediately but
      may not yet be connected to the server, when the call to <b>socket</b>
      returns. When a <b>gets</b> or <b>flush</b> is done on the socket before
      the connection attempt succeeds or fails, if the socket is in blocking
      mode, the operation will wait until the connection is completed or fails.
      If the socket is in nonblocking mode and a <b>gets</b> or <b>flush</b> is
      done on the socket before the connection attempt succeeds or fails, the
      operation returns immediately and <b>fblocked</b> on the socket returns 1.
      Synchronous client sockets may be switched (after they have connected) to
      operating in asynchronous mode using:</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SERVER_SOCKETS"><a class="permalink" href="#SERVER_SOCKETS">SERVER
  SOCKETS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-server</b> option is specified then the new socket will
    be a server for the port given by <i>port</i> (either an integer or a
    service name, where supported and understood by the host operating system;
    if <i>port</i> is zero, the operating system will allocate a free port to
    the server socket which may be discovered by using <b>fconfigure</b> to read
    the <b>-sockname</b> option). Tcl will automatically accept connections to
    the given port. For each connection Tcl will create a new channel that may
    be used to communicate with the client. Tcl then invokes <i>command</i> with
    three additional arguments: the name of the new channel, the address, in
    network address notation, of the client's host, and the client's port
    number.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following additional option may also be specified before
    <i>port</i>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="myaddr~2"><a class="permalink" href="#myaddr~2"><b>-myaddr</b><i>
    addr</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Addr</i> gives the domain-style name or numerical IP address of the
      server-side network interface to use for the connection. This option may
      be useful if the server machine has multiple network interfaces. If the
      option is omitted then the server socket is bound to the special address
      INADDR_ANY so that it can accept connections from any interface.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Server channels cannot be used for input or output; their sole use
    is to accept new client connections. The channels created for each incoming
    client connection are opened for input and output. Closing the server
    channel shuts down the server so that no new connections will be accepted;
    however, existing connections will be unaffected.</p>
<p class="Pp">Server sockets depend on the Tcl event mechanism to find out when
    new connections are opened. If the application does not enter the event
    loop, for example by invoking the <b>vwait</b> command or calling the C
    procedure <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>, then no connections will be accepted.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>port</i> is specified as zero, the operating system will
    allocate an unused port for use as a server socket. The port number actually
    allocated may be retrieved from the created server socket using the
    <b>fconfigure</b> command to retrieve the <b>-sockname</b> option as
    described below.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION_OPTIONS">CONFIGURATION
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>fconfigure</b> command can be used to query several
    readonly configuration options for socket channels:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="error"><a class="permalink" href="#error"><b>-error</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This option gets the current error status of the given socket. This is
      useful when you need to determine if an asynchronous connect operation
      succeeded. If there was an error, the error message is returned. If there
      was no error, an empty string is returned.</dd>
  <dt id="sockname"><a class="permalink" href="#sockname"><b>-sockname</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This option returns a list of three elements, the address, the host name
      and the port number for the socket. If the host name cannot be computed,
      the second element is identical to the address, the first element of the
      list.</dd>
  <dt id="peername"><a class="permalink" href="#peername"><b>-peername</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This option is not supported by server sockets. For client and accepted
      sockets, this option returns a list of three elements; these are the
      address, the host name and the port to which the peer socket is connected
      or bound. If the host name cannot be computed, the second element of the
      list is identical to the address, its first element.</dd>
