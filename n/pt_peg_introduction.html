   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">Are you lost ? Do you have trouble understanding this document ?
    In that case please read the overview provided by the <i>Introduction to
    Parser Tools</i>. This document is the entrypoint to the whole system the
    current package is a part of.</p>
<p class="Pp">Welcome to the introduction to <i>Parsing Expression Grammar</i>s
    (short: <i>PEG</i>), the formalism used by the Parser Tools. It is assumed
    that the reader has a basic knowledge of parsing theory, i.e.
    <i>Context-Free Grammars</i> (short: <i>CFG</i>), <i>languages</i>, and
    associated terms like <i>LL(k)</i>, <i>LR(k)</i>, <i>terminal</i> and
    <i>nonterminal</i> <i>symbols</i>, etc. We do not intend to recapitulate
    such basic definitions or terms like <i>useful</i>, <i>reachable</i>,
    (left/right) <i>recursive</i>, <i>nullable</i>, first/last/follow sets, etc.
    Please see the <b>References</b> at the end instead if you are in need of
    places and books which provide such background information.</p>
<p class="Pp">PEGs are formally very similar to CFGs, with terminal and
    nonterminal symbols, start symbol, and rules defining the structure of each
    nonterminal symbol. The main difference lies in the choice(sic!) of
    <i>choice</i> operators. Where CFGs use an <i>unordered choice</i> to
    represent alternatives PEGs use <i>prioritized choice</i>. Which is fancy
    way of saying that a parser has to try the first alternative first and can
    try the other alternatives if only if it fails for the first, and so on.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the CFG side this gives rise to LL(k) and LR(k) for making the
    choice <i>deterministic</i> with a bounded <i>lookahead</i> of k terminal
    symbols, where LL is in essence <i>topdown</i> aka <i>recursive descent</i>
    parsing, and LR <i>bottomup</i> aka <i>shift reduce</i> parsing.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the PEG side we can parse input with recursive descent and
    <i>backtracking</i> of failed choices, the latter of which amounts to
    unlimited lookahead. By additionally recording the success or failure of
    nonterminals at the specific locations they were tried at and reusing this
    information after backtracking we can avoid the exponential blowup of
    running time usually associated with backtracking and keep the parsing
    linear. The memory requirements are of course higher due to this cache, as
    we are trading space for time.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is the basic concept behind <i>packrat parsers</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">A limitation pure PEGs share with LL(k) CFGs is that
    <i>left-recursive</i> grammars cannot be parsed, with the associated
    recursive descent parser entering an infinite recursion. This limitation is
    usually overcome by extending pure PEGs with explicit operators to specify
    repetition, zero or more, and one or more, or, formally spoken, for the
    <i>kleene closure</i> and <i>positive kleene closure</i>. This is what the
    Parser Tools are doing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another extension, specific to Parser Tools, is a set of operators
    which map more or less directly to various character classes built into Tcl,
    i.e. the classes reachable via <b>string is</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The remainder of this document consists of the formal definition
    of PEGs for the mathematically inclined, and an appendix listing references
    to places with more information on PEGs specifically, and parsing in
    general.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="FORMAL_DEFINITION"><a class="permalink" href="#FORMAL_DEFINITION">FORMAL
  DEFINITION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">For the mathematically inclined, a Parsing Expression Grammar is a
    4-tuple (VN,VT,R,eS) where</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>VN is a set of <i>nonterminal symbols</i>,</li>
  <li>VT is a set of <i>terminal symbols</i>,</li>
  <li>R is a finite set of rules, where each rule is a pair (A,e), A in VN, and
      <i>e</i> a <i>parsing expression</i>.</li>
  <li>eS is a parsing expression, the <i>start expression</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Further constraints are</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The intersection of VN and VT is empty.</li>
  <li>For all A in VT exists exactly one pair (A,e) in R. In other words, R is a
      function from nonterminal symbols to parsing expressions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Parsing expressions are inductively defined via</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The empty string (epsilon) is a parsing expression.</li>
  <li>A terminal symbol <i>a</i> is a parsing expression.</li>
  <li>A nonterminal symbol <i>A</i> is a parsing expression.</li>
  <li><i>e1</i><i>e2</i> is a parsing expression for parsing expressions
      <i>e1</i> and <i>2</i>. This is called <i>sequence</i>.</li>
  <li><i>e1</i>/<i>e2</i> is a parsing expression for parsing expressions
      <i>e1</i> and <i>2</i>. This is called <i>ordered choice</i>.</li>
  <li><i>e</i>* is a parsing expression for parsing expression <i>e</i>. This is
      called <i>zero-or-more repetitions</i>, also known as <i>kleene
      closure</i>.</li>
  <li><i>e</i>+ is a parsing expression for parsing expression <i>e</i>. This is
      called <i>one-or-more repetitions</i>, also known as <i>positive kleene
      closure</i>.</li>
  <li>!<i>e</i> is a parsing expression for parsing expression <i>e1</i>. This
      is called a <i>not lookahead predicate</i>.</li>
  <li>&amp;<i>e</i> is a parsing expression for parsing expression <i>e1</i>.
      This is called an <i>and lookahead predicate</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">PEGs are used to define a grammatical structure for streams of
    symbols over VT. They are a modern phrasing of older formalisms invented by
    Alexander Birham. These formalisms were called TS (TMG recognition scheme),
    and gTS (generalized TS). Later they were renamed to TPDL (Top-Down Parsing
    Languages) and gTPDL (generalized TPDL).</p>
<p class="Pp">They can be easily implemented by recursive descent parsers with
    backtracking. This makes them relatives of LL(k) Context-Free Grammars.</p>
