   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This command keeps a simple database of the packages available for
    use by the current interpreter and how to load them into the interpreter. It
    supports multiple versions of each package and arranges for the correct
    version of a package to be loaded based on what is needed by the
    application. This command also detects and reports version clashes.
    Typically, only the <b>package require</b> and <b>package provide</b>
    commands are invoked in normal Tcl scripts; the other commands are used
    primarily by system scripts that maintain the package database.</p>
<p class="Pp">The behavior of the <b>package</b> command is determined by its
    first argument. The following forms are permitted:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="package"><a class="permalink" href="#package"><b>package forget
    ?</b><i>package package ...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Removes all information about each specified package from this
      interpreter, including information provided by both <b>package
      ifneeded</b> and <b>package provide</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="package~2"><a class="permalink" href="#package~2"><b>package ifneeded
    </b><i>package version</i> ?<i>script</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>This command typically appears only in system configuration scripts to set
      up the package database. It indicates that a particular version of a
      particular package is available if needed, and that the package can be
      added to the interpreter by executing <i>script</i>. The script is saved
      in a database for use by subsequent <b>package require</b> commands;
      typically, <i>script</i> sets up auto-loading for the commands in the
      package (or calls <b>load</b> and/or <b>source</b> directly), then invokes
      <b>package provide</b> to indicate that the package is present. There may
      be information in the database for several different versions of a single
      package. If the database already contains information for <i>package</i>
      and <i>version</i>, the new <i>script</i> replaces the existing one. If
      the <i>script</i> argument is omitted, the current script for version
      <i>version</i> of package <i>package</i> is returned, or an empty string
      if no <b>package ifneeded</b> command has been invoked for this
      <i>package</i> and <i>version</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="package~3"><a class="permalink" href="#package~3"><b>package
    names</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns a list of the names of all packages in the interpreter for which a
      version has been provided (via <b>package provide</b>) or for which a
      <b>package ifneeded</b> script is available. The order of elements in the
      list is arbitrary.</dd>
  <dt id="package~4"><a class="permalink" href="#package~4"><b>package
    present</b> ?<b>-exact</b>? <i>package</i> ?<i>requirement...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>This command is equivalent to <b>package require</b> except that it does
      not try and load the package if it is not already loaded.</dd>
  <dt id="package~5"><a class="permalink" href="#package~5"><b>package provide
    </b><i>package </i>?<i>version</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>This command is invoked to indicate that version <i>version</i> of package
      <i>package</i> is now present in the interpreter. It is typically invoked
      once as part of an <b>ifneeded</b> script, and again by the package itself
      when it is finally loaded. An error occurs if a different version of
      <i>package</i> has been provided by a previous <b>package provide</b>
      command. If the <i>version</i> argument is omitted, then the command
      returns the version number that is currently provided, or an empty string
      if no <b>package provide</b> command has been invoked for <i>package</i>
      in this interpreter.</dd>
  <dt id="package~6"><a class="permalink" href="#package~6"><b>package
    require</b> <i>package </i>?<i>requirement...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>This command is typically invoked by Tcl code that wishes to use a
      particular version of a particular package. The arguments indicate which
      package is wanted, and the command ensures that a suitable version of the
      package is loaded into the interpreter. If the command succeeds, it
      returns the version number that is loaded; otherwise it generates an
      error.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">A suitable version of the package is any version which satisfies
    at least one of the requirements, per the rules of <b>package</b>
    <b>vsatisfies</b>. If multiple versions are suitable the implementation with
    the highest version is chosen. This last part is additionally influenced by
    the selection mode set with <b>package prefer</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the &#x201C;stable&#x201D; selection mode the command will
    select the highest stable version satisfying the requirements, if any. If no
    stable version satisfies the requirements, the highest unstable version
    satisfying the requirements will be selected. In the &#x201C;latest&#x201D;
    selection mode the command will accept the highest version satisfying all
    the requirements, regardless of its stableness.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a version of <i>package</i> has already been provided (by
    invoking the <b>package provide</b> command), then its version number must
    satisfy the <i>requirement</i>s and the command returns immediately.
    Otherwise, the command searches the database of information provided by
    previous <b>package ifneeded</b> commands to see if an acceptable version of
    the package is available. If so, the script for the highest acceptable
    version number is evaluated in the global namespace; it must do whatever is
    necessary to load the package, including calling <b>package provide</b> for
    the package. If the <b>package ifneeded</b> database does not contain an
    acceptable version of the package and a <b>package unknown</b> command has
    been specified for the interpreter then that command is evaluated in the
    global namespace; when it completes, Tcl checks again to see if the package
    is now provided or if there is a <b>package ifneeded</b> script for it. If
    all of these steps fail to provide an acceptable version of the package,
    then the command returns an error.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="package~7"><a class="permalink" href="#package~7"><b>package require
    -exact </b><i>package version</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This form of the command is used when only the given <i>version</i> of
      <i>package</i> is acceptable to the caller. This command is equivalent to
      <b>package require </b><i>package version</i>-<i>version</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="package~8"><a class="permalink" href="#package~8"><b>package unknown
    </b>?<i>command</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>This command supplies a &#x201C;last resort&#x201D; command to invoke
      during <b>package require</b> if no suitable version of a package can be
      found in the <b>package ifneeded</b> database. If the <i>command</i>
      argument is supplied, it contains the first part of a command; when the
      command is invoked during a <b>package require</b> command, Tcl appends
      one or more additional arguments giving the desired package name and
      requirements. For example, if <i>command</i> is <b>foo bar</b> and later
      the command <b>package require test 2.4</b> is invoked, then Tcl will
      execute the command <b>foo bar test 2.4</b> to load the package. If no
      requirements are supplied to the <b>package require</b> command, then only
      the name will be added to invoked command. If the <b>package unknown</b>
      command is invoked without a <i>command</i> argument, then the current
      <b>package unknown</b> script is returned, or an empty string if there is
      none. If <i>command</i> is specified as an empty string, then the current
      <b>package unknown</b> script is removed, if there is one.</dd>
  <dt id="package~9"><a class="permalink" href="#package~9"><b>package vcompare
    </b><i>version1 version2</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Compares the two version numbers given by <i>version1</i> and
      <i>version2</i>. Returns -1 if <i>version1</i> is an earlier version than
      <i>version2</i>, 0 if they are equal, and 1 if <i>version1</i> is later
      than <b>version2</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="package~10"><a class="permalink" href="#package~10"><b>package
    versions </b><i>package</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns a list of all the version numbers of <i>package</i> for which
      information has been provided by <b>package ifneeded</b> commands.</dd>
  <dt id="package~11"><a class="permalink" href="#package~11"><b>package
    vsatisfies </b><i>version requirement...</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns 1 if the <i>version</i> satisfies at least one of the given
      requirements, and 0 otherwise. Each <i>requirement</i> is allowed to have
      any of the forms:</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="VERSION_NUMBERS"><a class="permalink" href="#VERSION_NUMBERS">VERSION
  NUMBERS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Version numbers consist of one or more decimal numbers separated
    by dots, such as 2 or 1.162 or 3.1.13.1. The first number is called the
    major version number. Larger numbers correspond to later versions of a
    package, with leftmost numbers having greater significance. For example,
    version 2.1 is later than 1.3 and version 3.4.6 is later than 3.3.5. Missing
    fields are equivalent to zeroes: version 1.3 is the same as version 1.3.0
    and 1.3.0.0, so it is earlier than 1.3.1 or 1.3.0.2. In addition, the
    letters &#x201C;a&#x201D; (alpha) and/or &#x201C;b&#x201D; (beta) may appear
    exactly once to replace a dot for separation. These letters semantically add
    a negative specifier into the version, where &#x201C;a&#x201D; is -2, and
    &#x201C;b&#x201D; is -1. Each may be specified only once, and
    &#x201C;a&#x201D; or &#x201C;b&#x201D; are mutually exclusive in a
    specifier. Thus 1.3a1 becomes (semantically) 1.3.-2.1, 1.3b1 is 1.3.-1.1.
    Negative numbers are not directly allowed in version specifiers. A version
    number not containing the letters &#x201C;a&#x201D; or &#x201C;b&#x201D; as
    specified above is called a <b>stable</b> version, whereas presence of the
    letters causes the version to be called is <b>unstable</b>. A later version
    number is assumed to be upwards compatible with an earlier version number as
    long as both versions have the same major version number. For example, Tcl
    scripts written for version 2.3 of a package should work unchanged under
    versions 2.3.2, 2.4, and 2.5.1. Changes in the major version number signify
    incompatible changes: if code is written to use version 2.1 of a package, it
    is not guaranteed to work unmodified with either version 1.7.3 or version
    3.1.</p>

<p class="Pp">The recommended way to use packages in Tcl is to invoke <b>package
