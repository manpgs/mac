   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">This command is used to bring the application &#x201C;up to
    date&#x201D; by entering the event loop repeatedly until all pending events
    (including idle callbacks) have been processed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>idletasks</b> keyword is specified as an argument to the
    command, then no new events or errors are processed; only idle callbacks are
    invoked. This causes operations that are normally deferred, such as display
    updates and window layout calculations, to be performed immediately.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>update idletasks</b> command is useful in scripts where
    changes have been made to the application's state and you want those changes
    to appear on the display immediately, rather than waiting for the script to
    complete. Most display updates are performed as idle callbacks, so <b>update
    idletasks</b> will cause them to run. However, there are some kinds of
    updates that only happen in response to events, such as those triggered by
    window size changes; these updates will not occur in <b>update
    idletasks</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>update</b> command with no options is useful in scripts
    where you are performing a long-running computation but you still want the
    application to respond to events such as user interactions; if you
    occasionally call <b>update</b> then user input will be processed during the
    next call to <b>update</b>.</p>
