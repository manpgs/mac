   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">All Tcl commands and C procedures that take file names as
    arguments expect the file names to be in one of three forms, depending on
    the current platform. On each platform, Tcl supports file names in the
    standard forms(s) for that platform. In addition, on all platforms, Tcl
    supports a Unix-like syntax intended to provide a convenient way of
    constructing simple file names. However, scripts that are intended to be
    portable should not assume a particular form for file names. Instead,
    portable scripts must use the <b>file split</b> and <b>file</b> <b>join</b>
    commands to manipulate file names (see the <b>file</b> manual entry for more
    details).</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PATH_TYPES"><a class="permalink" href="#PATH_TYPES">PATH
  TYPES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">File names are grouped into three general types based on the
    starting point for the path used to specify the file: absolute, relative,
    and volume-relative. Absolute names are completely qualified, giving a path
    to the file relative to a particular volume and the root directory on that
    volume. Relative names are unqualified, giving a path to the file relative
    to the current working directory. Volume-relative names are partially
    qualified, either giving the path relative to the root directory on the
    current volume, or relative to the current directory of the specified
    volume. The <b>file pathtype</b> command can be used to determine the type
    of a given path.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PATH_SYNTAX"><a class="permalink" href="#PATH_SYNTAX">PATH
  SYNTAX</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The rules for native names depend on the value reported in the Tcl
    array element <b>tcl_platform(platform)</b>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Unix"><a class="permalink" href="#Unix"><b>Unix</b></a></dt>
  <dd>On Unix and Apple MacOS X platforms, Tcl uses path names where the
      components are separated by slashes. Path names may be relative or
      absolute, and file names may contain any character other than slash. The
      file names <b>.</b> and <b>..</b> are special and refer to the current
      directory and the parent of the current directory respectively. Multiple
      adjacent slash characters are interpreted as a single separator. Any
      number of trailing slash characters at the end of a path are simply
      ignored, so the paths <b>foo</b>, <b>foo/</b> and <b>foo//</b> are all
      identical, and in particular <b>foo/</b> does not necessarily mean a
      directory is being referred.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The following examples illustrate various forms of path names:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>/</b></dt>
  <dd>Absolute path to the root directory.</dd>
  <dt><b>/etc/passwd</b></dt>
  <dd>Absolute path to the file named <b>passwd</b> in the directory <b>etc</b>
      in the root directory.</dd>
  <dt><b>.</b></dt>
  <dd>Relative path to the current directory.</dd>
  <dt id="foo"><a class="permalink" href="#foo"><b>foo</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Relative path to the file <b>foo</b> in the current directory.</dd>
  <dt id="foo/bar"><a class="permalink" href="#foo/bar"><b>foo/bar</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Relative path to the file <b>bar</b> in the directory <b>foo</b> in the
      current directory.</dd>
  <dt><b>../foo</b></dt>
  <dd>Relative path to the file <b>foo</b> in the directory above the current
      directory.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Windows"><a class="permalink" href="#Windows"><b>Windows</b></a></dt>
  <dd>On Microsoft Windows platforms, Tcl supports both drive-relative and UNC
      style names. Both <b>/</b> and <b>\</b> may be used as directory
      separators in either type of name. Drive-relative names consist of an
      optional drive specifier followed by an absolute or relative path. UNC
      paths follow the general form <b>\\servername\sharename\path\file</b>, but
      must at the very least contain the server and share components, i.e.
      <b>\\servername\sharename</b>. In both forms, the file names <b>.</b> and
      <b>..</b> are special and refer to the current directory and the parent of
      the current directory respectively. The following examples illustrate
      various forms of path names:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Host"><a class="permalink" href="#Host"><b>\\Host\share/file</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Absolute UNC path to a file called <b>file</b> in the root directory of
      the export point <b>share</b> on the host <b>Host</b>. Note that repeated
      use of <b>file dirname</b> on this path will give <b>//Host/share</b>, and
      will never give just <b>//Host</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="c:foo"><a class="permalink" href="#c:foo"><b>c:foo</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Volume-relative path to a file <b>foo</b> in the current directory on
      drive <b>c</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="c:/foo"><a class="permalink" href="#c:/foo"><b>c:/foo</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Absolute path to a file <b>foo</b> in the root directory of drive
      <b>c</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="foo~2"><a class="permalink" href="#foo~2"><b>foo\bar</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Relative path to a file <b>bar</b> in the <b>foo</b> directory in the
      current directory on the current volume.</dd>
  <dt id="foo~3"><a class="permalink" href="#foo~3"><b>\foo</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Volume-relative path to a file <b>foo</b> in the root directory of the
      current volume.</dd>
  <dt id="foo~4"><a class="permalink" href="#foo~4"><b>\\foo</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Volume-relative path to a file <b>foo</b> in the root directory of the
      current volume. This is not a valid UNC path, so the assumption is that
      the extra backslashes are superfluous.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="TILDE_SUBSTITUTION"><a class="permalink" href="#TILDE_SUBSTITUTION">TILDE
  SUBSTITUTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In addition to the file name rules described above, Tcl also
    supports <i>csh</i>-style tilde substitution. If a file name starts with a
    tilde, then the file name will be interpreted as if the first element is
    replaced with the location of the home directory for the given user. If the
    tilde is followed immediately by a separator, then the <b>$HOME</b>
    environment variable is substituted. Otherwise the characters between the
    tilde and the next separator are taken as a user name, which is used to
    retrieve the user's home directory for substitution. This works on Unix,
    MacOS X and Windows (except very old releases).</p>
<p class="Pp">Old Windows platforms do not support tilde substitution when a
    user name follows the tilde. On these platforms, attempts to use a tilde
    followed by a user name will generate an error that the user does not exist
    when Tcl attempts to interpret that part of the path or otherwise access the
    file. The behaviour of these paths when not trying to interpret them is the
    same as on Unix. File names that have a tilde without a user name will be
    correctly substituted using the <b>$HOME</b> environment variable, just like
    for Unix.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PORTABILITY_ISSUES"><a class="permalink" href="#PORTABILITY_ISSUES">PORTABILITY
  ISSUES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Not all file systems are case sensitive, so scripts should avoid
    code that depends on the case of characters in a file name. In addition, the
    character sets allowed on different devices may differ, so scripts should
    choose file names that do not contain special characters like:
    <b>&lt;&gt;:?&quot;/\|</b>. The safest approach is to use names consisting
    of alphanumeric characters only. Care should be taken with filenames which
    contain spaces (common on Windows systems) and filenames where the backslash
    is the directory separator (Windows native path names). Also Windows 3.1
    only supports file names with a root of no more than 8 characters and an
    extension of no more than 3 characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Windows platforms there are file and path length restrictions.
    Complete paths or filenames longer than about 260 characters will lead to
    errors in most file operations.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another Windows peculiarity is that any number of trailing dots
    &#x201C;.&#x201D; in filenames are totally ignored, so, for example,
    attempts to create a file or directory with a name &#x201C;foo.&#x201D; will
    result in the creation of a file/directory with name &#x201C;foo&#x201D;.
    This fact is reflected in the results of <b>file normalize</b>. Furthermore,
    a file name consisting only of dots &#x201C;.........&#x201D; or dots with
    trailing characters &#x201C;.....abc&#x201D; is illegal.</p>
