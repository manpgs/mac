   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">This package provides objects which can be used to query and
    transform tree objects following the API of tree objects created by the
    package <b>struct::tree</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The tree query and manipulation language used here, TreeQL, is
    inspired by Cost (See section <b>References</b> for more information).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>treeql</b>, the package, is a fairly thin query facility over
    tree-structured data types. It implements an ordered set of nodes (really a
    list) which are generated and filtered through the application of TreeQL
    operators to each node in turn.</p>

<p class="Pp">The command <b>treeql</b> is a <b>snit</b>::type which implements
    the Treeql Query Language. This means that it follows the API for class
    commands as specified by the package <b>snit</b>. Its general syntax is</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="treeql"><a class="permalink" href="#treeql"><b>treeql</b>
    <i>objectname</i> <b>-tree</b> <i>tree</i> ?<b>-query</b> <i>query</i>?
    ?<b>-nodes</b> <i>nodes</i>? ?<i>args</i>...?</a></dt>
  <dd>The command creates a new tree query object and returns the fully
      qualified name of the object command as its result. The API the returned
      command is following is described in the section <b>TreeQL OBJECT API</b>
    <p class="Pp">Each query object is associated with a single <i>tree</i>
        object. This is the object all queries will be run against.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the option <b>-nodes</b> was specified then its argument is
        treated as a list of nodes. This list is used to initialize the node
        set. It defaults to the empty list.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the option <b>-query</b> was specified then its argument
        will be interpreted as an object, the <i>parent query</i> of this query.
        It defaults to the object itself. All queries will be interpreted in the
        environment of this object.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Any arguments coming after the options are treated as a query
        and run immediately, after the <i>node set</i> has been initialized.
        This uses the same syntax for the query as the method <b>query</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The operations of the TreeQL available for this are explained
        in the section about <b>The Tree Query Language</b>. This section also
        explains the term <i>node set</i> used above.</p>

<p class="Pp">As <b>treeql</b> has been implemented in <b>snit</b> all the
    standard methods of <b>snit</b>-based classes are available to the user and
    therefore not listed here. Please read the documentation for <b>snit</b> for
    what they are and what functionality they provide</p>
<p class="Pp">The methods provided by the package <b>treeql</b> itself are
    listed and explained below.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="qo"><a class="permalink" href="#qo"><i>qo</i> <b>query</b>
    <i>args</i>...</a></dt>
  <dd>This method interprets its arguments as a series of TreeQL operators and
      interpretes them from the left to right (i.e. first to last). Note that
      the first operator uses the <i>node set</i> currently known to the object
      to perform its actions. In other words, the <i>node set</i> is <i>not</i>
      cleared, or modified in other ways, before the query is run. This allows
      the user to run several queries one after the other and have each use the
      results of the last. Any initialization has to be done by any query
      itself, using TreeQL operators. The result of the method is the <i>node
      set</i> after the last operator of the query has been executed.
    <p class="Pp"><i>Note</i> that uncaught errors will leave the <i>node
        set</i> of the object in an intermediate state, per the TreeQL operators
        which were executed successfully before the error occurred.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The above means in detail that:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>The first argument is interpreted as the name of a query operator, the
      number of arguments required by that operator is then determined, and
      taken from the immediately following arguments.
    <p class="Pp">Because of this operators cannot have optional arguments, all
        arguments have to be present as defined. Failure to do this will, at
        least, confuse the query interpreter, but more likely cause errors.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>The operator is applied to the current node set, yielding a new node set,
      and/or manipulating the tree object the query object is connected to.</dd>

  <dd>The arguments used (i.e. operator name and arguments) are removed from the
      list of method arguments, and then the whole process is repeated from step
      [1], until the list of arguments is empty or an error occurred.</dd>

  CONCEPTS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The main concept which has to be understood is that of the <i>node
    set</i>. Each query object maintains exactly one such <i>node set</i>, and
    essentially all operators use it and input argument and for their result.
    This structure simply contains the handles of all nodes which are currently
    of interest to the query object. To name it a <i>set</i> is a bit of a
    misnomer, because</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>A node (handle) can occur in the structure more than once, and</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>the order of nodes in the structure is important as well. Whenever an
      operator processes all nodes in the node set it will do so in the order
      they occur in the structure.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Regarding the possible multiple occurrence of a node, consider a
    node set containing two nodes A and B, both having node P as their immediate
    parent. Application of the TreeQL operator &quot;parent&quot; will then add
    P to the new node set twice, once per node it was parent of. I.e. the new
    node set will then be {P P}.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="STRUCTURAL_GENERATORS"><a class="permalink" href="#STRUCTURAL_GENERATORS">STRUCTURAL
  GENERATORS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">All tree-structural operators locate nodes in the tree based on a
    structural relation ship to the nodes currently in the set and then replace
    the current node set with the set of nodes found Nodes which fulfill such a
    relationship multiple times are added to the result as often as they fulfill
    the relationship.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is important to note that the found nodes are collected in a
    separate storage area while processing the node set, and are added to (or
    replacing) the current node set only after the current node set has been
    processed completely. In other words, the new nodes are <i>not</i> processed
    by the operator as well and do not affect the iteration.</p>
<p class="Pp">When describing an operator the variable <b>N</b> will be used to
    refer to any node in the node set.</p>

<p class="Pp">These operators retrieve the values of node attributes from the
    underlying tree. The collected results are stored in the node set, but are
    not actually nodes.</p>
<p class="Pp">In other words, they redefine the semantics of the node set stored
    by the query object to contain non-node data after their completion.</p>
<p class="Pp">The query interpreter will terminate after it has finished
    processing one of these operators, silently discarding any later query
    elements. It also means that our talk about maintenance of a node set is not
    quite true. It is a node set while the interpreter is processing commands,
    but can be left as an attribute value set at the end of query
  processing.</p>

    <p class="Pp">The operator will fail if a node does not have an attribute
        named <i>attr</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The argument <i>op</i> is interpreted as partial argument list
        for the builtin command <b>string</b>. Its first word has to be any of
        the sub-commands understood by <b>string</b>. This has to be followed by
        all arguments required for the subcommand, except the last. that last
        argument is supplied by the attribute value.</p>
