   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">The package <b>vfs</b> provides commands to query, mount and
    unmount virtual filesystems implemented in Tcl. This is further facilitated
    through the provison of helper commands in a tcl script library. See section
    &quot;HANDLER ENVIRONMENT&quot; of <b>vfs-fsapi</b> for more
  information.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once a virtual filesystem is in place, the standard Tcl commands,
    like <b>file</b>, <b>glob</b>, <b>cd</b>, <b>pwd</b>, <b>open</b>, including
    all their C APIs in the Tcl library (e.g. <b>Tcl_FSOpenFileChannel</b>,
    <b>Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory</b>, extensions such as <b>Tk</b> which may open
    or read files will also transparently access the virtual filesystem).</p>
<p class="Pp">Because all of Tcl's filesystem activity passes through a single
    layer, every operation can be intercepted. This package does just that. This
    is also quite different from simply overloading the <b>file</b> command in
    Tcl. We are actually providing replacements for C commands like
    <b>access</b>, <b>stat</b>, etc. By implementing a small number of low-level
    commands we ensure that all commands at higher levels will function
    irrespective of what is going on inside the filesystem layer.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tcl's filesystem hooks operate on a per-process basis. This means
    every Tcl interpreter in the same process/application will see the same
    filesystem, including any virtual filesystems.</p>
<p class="Pp">To access this package use the command <b>package require vfs</b>.
    This automatically registers the vfs hooks into Tcl's filesystem and
    provides the command <b>vfs::filesystem</b>. The latter allows the
    registration of actual virtual filesystems. More in the upcoming section
    <b>API</b>. The hooks will not be removed until Tcl exits. If desired,
    control over this could be exposed to Tcl in the future. By and in itself
    the command above will have no further effect. Only after filesystem
    implementations have been registered and filesystems using them been mounted
    filesystem commands will actually be intercepted, and handled by the Tcl
    code of the mounted virtual filesystem.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="vfs::filesystem"><a class="permalink" href="#vfs::filesystem"><b>vfs::filesystem</b>
    <b>mount</b> ?<b>-volume</b>? <i>path</i> <i>command</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Mount</i>s a virtual filesystem at <i>path</i>, making it useable.
      After completion of the call any access to a subdirectory of <i>path</i>
      will be handled by that filesystem. The filesystem is represented here by
      the <i>command</i> prefix which will be executed whenever an operation on
      a file or directory within <i>path</i> has to be performed.
    <p class="Pp">Whether the <i>command</i> is implemented in C or Tcl is of no
        relevance as long as it adheres to the API specified in <b>vfs-fsapi</b>
        and is present in the interpreter where the mount operation is
      executed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the option <b>-volume</b> is specified the new mount point
        is also registered with Tcl as a new volume and will therefore from then
        on appear in the output of the command <b>file volumes</b>. This is
        useful (and required for reasonable operation) for mounts like
        <b>ftp://</b>. It should not be used for paths mounted inside the native
        filesystem.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The new filesystem mounts will be observed immediately in all
        interpreters in the current process. If the interpreter is later
        deleted, all mounts which are intercepted by it will be automatically
        removed (and will therefore affect the view of the filesystem seen by
        all interpreters).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="vfs::filesystem~2"><a class="permalink" href="#vfs::filesystem~2"><b>vfs::filesystem</b>
    <b>unmount</b> <i>path</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This unmounts the virtual filesystem which was mounted at <i>path</i>. An
      error is thrown if no filesystem was mounted there. After the completion
      of the operation the filesystem is not visible anymore, and any previous
      filesystem accessible through this path becomes accessible again.</dd>
  <dt id="vfs::filesystem~3"><a class="permalink" href="#vfs::filesystem~3"><b>vfs::filesystem</b>
    <b>info</b> ?<i>path</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>A list of all filesystems mounted in all interpreters is returned, if no
      <i>path</i> argument was specified. Else the filesystem responsible for
      that <i>path</i> is examined and the command prefix used to handle all
      filesystem operations returned. An error is thrown if no filesystem is
      mounted for that <i>path</i>.
    <p class="Pp">There is currently no facility for examining in which
        interpreter each command will be evaluated.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="vfs::filesystem~4"><a class="permalink" href="#vfs::filesystem~4"><b>vfs::filesystem</b>
    <b>fullynormalize</b> <i>path</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Performs a full expansion of <i>path</i>, (as per <b>file</b>
      <b>normalize</b>). This includes the following of any links in the last
      element of <i>path</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="vfs::filesystem~5"><a class="permalink" href="#vfs::filesystem~5"><b>vfs::filesystem</b>
    <b>posixerror</b> <i>int</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This command can be called by filesystem implementations during the
      execution of a filesystem operation to signal the posix error code of a
      failure. See also <b>vfs-fsapi</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="vfs::filesystem~6"><a class="permalink" href="#vfs::filesystem~6"><b>vfs::filesystem</b>
    <b>internalerror</b> <i>command</i></a></dt>
  <dd>When used the specified <i>command</i> is registerd as the command to trap
      and report any internal errors thrown by filesystem implementations.</dd>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="LIMITATIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The code of the package <b>vfs</b> has only a few limitations.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>One subtlety one has to be aware of is that mixing case-(in)sensitive
      filesystems and application code may yield unexpected results.
    <p class="Pp">For example mounting a case-sensitive virtual filesystem into
        a case-insensitive system (like the standard Windows or MacOS
        filesystems) and then using this with code relying on case-insensitivity
        problems will appear when accessing the virtual filesystem.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that application code relying on case-insensitivity will
        not under Unix either, i.e. is inherently non-portable, and should be
        fixed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>The C-API's for <b>link</b> and <b>lstat</b> are currently not exposed to
      the Tcl level. This may be done in the future to allow virtual filesystems
      implemented in Tcl to support the reading and writing of links.</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>The public C-API filesystem function <b>Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory</b> is
      given a variety of type information in a <i>Tcl_GlobTypeData</i>
      structure. Currently only the <i>type</i> field of said strcuture is
      exposed to the tcl-level. Fields like <i>permissions</i> and MacOS
      <i>type/creator</i> are ignored.</dd>
