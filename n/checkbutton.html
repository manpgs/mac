   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">[<span class="Op"><b>-command</b> <i>command</i>]</span> Specifies
    a Tcl command to associate with the button. This command is typically
    invoked when mouse button 1 is released over the button window. The button's
    global variable (<b>-variable</b> option) will be updated before the command
    is invoked. [<span class="Op"><b>-height</b> <i>height</i>]</span> Specifies
    a desired height for the button. If an image or bitmap is being displayed in
    the button then the value is in screen units (i.e. any of the forms
    acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>); for text it is in lines of text. If this
    option is not specified, the button's desired height is computed from the
    size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-indicatoron</b> <i>indicatorOn</i>]</span> Specifies
    whether or not the indicator should be drawn. Must be a proper boolean
    value. If false, the <b>relief</b> option is ignored and the widget's relief
    is always sunken if the widget is selected and raised otherwise.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-offrelief</b> <i>offRelief</i>]</span> Specifies the
    relief for the checkbutton when the indicator is not drawn and the
    checkbutton is off. The default value is &#x201C;raised&#x201D;. By setting
    this option to &#x201C;flat&#x201D; and setting <b>-indicatoron</b> to false
    and <b>-overrelief</b> to &#x201C;raised&#x201D;, the effect is achieved of
    having a flat button that raises on mouse-over and which is depressed when
    activated. This is the behavior typically exhibited by the Bold, Italic, and
    Underline checkbuttons on the toolbar of a word-processor, for example.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-offvalue</b> <i>offValue</i>]</span> Specifies value
    to store in the button's associated variable whenever this button is
    deselected. Defaults to &#x201C;0&#x201D;. [<span class="Op"><b>-onvalue</b>
    <i>onValue</i>]</span> Specifies value to store in the button's associated
    variable whenever this button is selected. Defaults to &#x201C;1&#x201D;.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-overrelief</b> <i>overRelief</i>]</span> Specifies an
    alternative relief for the checkbutton, to be used when the mouse cursor is
    over the widget. This option can be used to make toolbar buttons, by
    configuring <b>-relief flat -overrelief</b> <b>raised</b>. If the value of
    this option is the empty string, then no alternative relief is used when the
    mouse cursor is over the checkbutton. The empty string is the default value.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-selectcolor</b> <i>selectColor</i>]</span> Specifies a
    background color to use when the button is selected. If <b>indicatorOn</b>
    is true then the color is used as the background for the indicator
    regardless of the select state. If <b>indicatorOn</b> is false, this color
    is used as the background for the entire widget, in place of
    <b>background</b> or <b>activeBackground</b>, whenever the widget is
    selected. If specified as an empty string then no special color is used for
    displaying when the widget is selected.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-selectimage</b> <i>selectImage</i>]</span> Specifies
    an image to display (in place of the <b>image</b> option) when the
    checkbutton is selected. This option is ignored unless the <b>image</b>
    option has been specified. [<span class="Op"><b>-state</b>
    <i>state</i>]</span> Specifies one of three states for the checkbutton:
    <b>normal</b>, <b>active</b>, or <b>disabled</b>. In normal state the
    checkbutton is displayed using the <b>foreground</b> and <b>background</b>
    options. The active state is typically used when the pointer is over the
    checkbutton. In active state the checkbutton is displayed using the
    <b>activeForeground</b> and <b>activeBackground</b> options. Disabled state
    means that the checkbutton should be insensitive: the default bindings will
    refuse to activate the widget and will ignore mouse button presses. In this
    state the <b>disabledForeground</b> and <b>background</b> options determine
    how the checkbutton is displayed. [<span class="Op"><b>-tristateimage</b>
    <i>tristateImage</i>]</span> Specifies an image to display (in place of the
    <b>image</b> option) when the checkbutton is in tri-state mode. This option
    is ignored unless the <b>image</b> option has been specified.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-tristatevalue</b> <i>tristateValue</i>]</span>
    Specifies the value that causes the checkbutton to display the multi-value
    selection, also known as the tri-state mode. Defaults to &#x201C;&#x201D;.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-variable</b> <i>variable</i>]</span> Specifies name of
    global variable to set to indicate whether or not this button is selected.
    Defaults to the name of the button within its parent (i.e. the last element
    of the button window's path name). [<span class="Op"><b>-width</b>
    <i>width</i>]</span> Specifies a desired width for the button. If an image
    or bitmap is being displayed in the button then the value is in screen units
    (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>); for text it is in
    characters. If this option is not specified, the button's desired width is
    computed from the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in
  it.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>checkbutton</b> command creates a new window (given by the
    <i>pathName</i> argument) and makes it into a checkbutton widget. Additional
    options, described above, may be specified on the command line or in the
    option database to configure aspects of the checkbutton such as its colors,
    font, text, and initial relief. The <b>checkbutton</b> command returns its
    <i>pathName</i> argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must
    not exist a window named <i>pathName</i>, but <i>pathName</i>'s parent must
    exist.</p>
<p class="Pp">A checkbutton is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap
    or image and a square called an <i>indicator</i>. If text is displayed, it
    must all be in a single font, but it can occupy multiple lines on the screen
    (if it contains newlines or if wrapping occurs because of the
    <b>wrapLength</b> option) and one of the characters may optionally be
    underlined using the <b>underline</b> option. A checkbutton has all of the
    behavior of a simple button, including the following: it can display itself
    in either of three different ways, according to the <b>state</b> option; it
    can be made to appear raised, sunken, or flat; it can be made to flash; and
    it invokes a Tcl command whenever mouse button 1 is clicked over the
    checkbutton.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, checkbuttons can be <i>selected</i>. If a checkbutton
    is selected then the indicator is normally drawn with a selected appearance,
    and a Tcl variable associated with the checkbutton is set to a particular
    value (normally 1). The indicator is drawn with a check mark inside. If the
    checkbutton is not selected, then the indicator is drawn with a deselected
    appearance, and the associated variable is set to a different value
    (typically 0). The indicator is drawn without a check mark inside. In the
    special case where the variable (if specified) has a value that matches the
    tristatevalue, the indicator is drawn with a tri-state appearance and is in
    the tri-state mode indicating mixed or multiple values. (This is used when
    the check box represents the state of multiple items.) The indicator is
    drawn in a platform dependent manner. Under Unix and Windows, the background
    interior of the box is &#x201C;grayed&#x201D;. Under Mac, the indicator is
    drawn with a dash mark inside. By default, the name of the variable
    associated with a checkbutton is the same as the <i>name</i> used to create
    the checkbutton. The variable name, and the &#x201C;on&#x201D;,
    &#x201C;off&#x201D; and &#x201C;tristate&#x201D; values stored in it, may be
    modified with options on the command line or in the option database.
    Configuration options may also be used to modify the way the indicator is
    displayed (or whether it is displayed at all). By default a checkbutton is
    configured to select and deselect itself on alternate button clicks. In
    addition, each checkbutton monitors its associated variable and
    automatically selects and deselects itself when the variables value changes
    to and from the button's &#x201C;on&#x201D;, &#x201C;off&#x201D; and
    &#x201C;tristate&#x201D; values.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="WIDGET_COMMAND"><a class="permalink" href="#WIDGET_COMMAND">WIDGET
  COMMAND</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>checkbutton</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose
    name is <i>pathName</i>. This command may be used to invoke various
    operations on the widget. It has the following general form:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>pathName option </i>?<i>arg arg ...</i>?
</pre>
</div>
<i>Option</i> and the <i>arg</i>s determine the exact behavior of the command.
  The following commands are possible for checkbutton widgets:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="pathName"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName"><i>pathName
    </i><b>cget</b> <i>option</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
      <i>option</i>. <i>Option</i> may have any of the values accepted by the
      <b>checkbutton</b> command.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~2"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~2"><i>pathName
    </i><b>configure</b> ?<i>option</i>? ?<i>value option value
    ...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
      <i>option</i> is specified, returns a list describing all of the available
      options for <i>pathName</i> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information
      on the format of this list). If <i>option</i> is specified with no
      <i>value</i>, then the command returns a list describing the one named
      option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the
      value returned if no <i>option</i> is specified). If one or more
      <i>option-value</i> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the
      given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
      command returns an empty string. <i>Option</i> may have any of the values
      accepted by the <b>checkbutton</b> command.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~3"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~3"><i>pathName
    </i><b>deselect</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Deselects the checkbutton and sets the associated variable to its
      &#x201C;off&#x201D; value.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~4"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~4"><i>pathName
    </i><b>flash</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Flashes the checkbutton. This is accomplished by redisplaying the
      checkbutton several times, alternating between active and normal colors.
      At the end of the flash the checkbutton is left in the same normal/active
      state as when the command was invoked. This command is ignored if the
      checkbutton's state is <b>disabled</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~5"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~5"><i>pathName
    </i><b>invoke</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Does just what would have happened if the user invoked the checkbutton
      with the mouse: toggle the selection state of the button and invoke the
      Tcl command associated with the checkbutton, if there is one. The return
      value is the return value from the Tcl command, or an empty string if
      there is no command associated with the checkbutton. This command is
      ignored if the checkbutton's state is <b>disabled</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~6"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~6"><i>pathName
    </i><b>select</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Selects the checkbutton and sets the associated variable to its
      &#x201C;on&#x201D; value.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~7"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~7"><i>pathName
    </i><b>toggle</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Toggles the selection state of the button, redisplaying it and modifying
      its associated variable to reflect the new state.</dd>
</dl>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="BINDINGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BINDINGS">BINDINGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Tk automatically creates class bindings for checkbuttons that give
    them the following default behavior:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>On Unix systems, a checkbutton activates whenever the mouse passes over it
      and deactivates whenever the mouse leaves the checkbutton. On Mac and
      Windows systems, when mouse button 1 is pressed over a checkbutton, the
      button activates whenever the mouse pointer is inside the button, and
      deactivates whenever the mouse pointer leaves the button.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>When mouse button 1 is pressed over a checkbutton, it is invoked (its
      selection state toggles and the command associated with the button is
      invoked, if there is one).</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>When a checkbutton has the input focus, the space key causes the
      checkbutton to be invoked. Under Windows, there are additional key
      bindings; plus (+) and equal (=) select the button, and minus (-)
      deselects the button.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If the checkbutton's state is <b>disabled</b> then none of the
    above actions occur: the checkbutton is completely non-responsive.</p>
<p class="Pp">The behavior of checkbuttons can be changed by defining new
    bindings for individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.</p>
