   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><i>Ops</i> indicates which operations are of interest, and is a
    list of one or more of the following items:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="rename"><a class="permalink" href="#rename"><b>rename</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> whenever the traced command is renamed. Note
      that renaming to the empty string is considered deletion, and will not be
      traced with &#x201C;<b>rename</b>&#x201D;.</dd>
  <dt id="delete"><a class="permalink" href="#delete"><b>delete</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> when the traced command is deleted. Commands
      can be deleted explicitly by using the <b>rename</b> command to rename the
      command to an empty string. Commands are also deleted when the interpreter
      is deleted, but traces will not be invoked because there is no interpreter
      in which to execute them.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When the trace triggers, depending on the operations being traced,
    a number of arguments are appended to <i>commandPrefix</i> so that the
    actual command is as follows:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>commandPrefix oldName newName op</i>
</pre>
</div>
<i>OldName</i> and <i>newName</i> give the traced command's current (old) name,
  and the name to which it is being renamed (the empty string if this is a
  &#x201C;delete&#x201D; operation). <i>Op</i> indicates what operation is being
  performed on the command, and is one of <b>rename</b> or <b>delete</b> as
  defined above. The trace operation cannot be used to stop a command from being
  deleted. Tcl will always remove the command once the trace is complete.
  Recursive renaming or deleting will not cause further traces of the same type
  to be evaluated, so a delete trace which itself deletes the command, or a
  rename trace which itself renames the command will not cause further trace
  evaluations to occur. Both <i>oldName</i> and <i>newName</i> are fully
  qualified with any namespace(s) in which they appear.</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="trace~3"><a class="permalink" href="#trace~3"><b>trace add

  <dd>Arrange for <i>commandPrefix</i> to be executed (with additional

  <dd>Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> for every Tcl command which is executed from
      the start of the execution of the procedure <i>name</i> until that
      procedure finishes. <i>CommandPrefix</i> is invoked just before the actual
      execution of the Tcl command being reported takes place. For example if we
      have &#x201C;proc foo {} { puts &quot;hello&quot; }&#x201D;, then an
      <i>enterstep</i> trace would be invoked just before &#x201C;<i>puts
      &quot;hello&quot;</i>&#x201D; is executed. Setting an <i>enterstep</i>
      trace on a command <i>name</i> that does not refer to a procedure will not
      result in an error and is simply ignored.</dd>
  <dt id="leavestep"><a class="permalink" href="#leavestep"><b>leavestep</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> for every Tcl command which is executed from
      the start of the execution of the procedure <i>name</i> until that
      procedure finishes. <i>CommandPrefix</i> is invoked just after the actual
      execution of the Tcl command being reported takes place. Setting a
      <i>leavestep</i> trace on a command <i>name</i> that does not refer to a
      procedure will not result in an error and is simply ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When the trace triggers, depending on the operations being traced,
    a number of arguments are appended to <i>commandPrefix</i> so that the
    actual command is as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp">For <b>enter</b> and <b>enterstep</b> operations:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>commandPrefix command-string op</i>
</pre>
</div>
<i>Command-string</i> gives the complete current command being executed (the
  traced command for a <b>enter</b> operation, an arbitrary command for a
  <b>enterstep</b> operation), including all arguments in their fully expanded
  form. <i>Op</i> indicates what operation is being performed on the command
  execution, and is one of <b>enter</b> or <b>enterstep</b> as defined above.
  The trace operation can be used to stop the command from executing, by
  deleting the command in question. Of course when the command is subsequently
  executed, an &#x201C;invalid command&#x201D; error will occur.
<p class="Pp">For <b>leave</b> and <b>leavestep</b> operations:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>command command-string code result op</i>
</pre>
</div>
<i>Command-string</i> gives the complete current command being executed (the
  traced command for a <b>enter</b> operation, an arbitrary command for a
  <b>enterstep</b> operation), including all arguments in their fully expanded
  form. <i>Code</i> gives the result code of that execution, and <i>result</i>
  the result string. <i>Op</i> indicates what operation is being performed on
  the command execution, and is one of <b>leave</b> or <b>leavestep</b> as
  defined above. Note that the creation of many <b>enterstep</b> or
  <b>leavestep</b> traces can lead to unintuitive results, since the invoked
  commands from one trace can themselves lead to further command invocations for
  other traces.
<p class="Pp"><i>CommandPrefix</i> executes in the same context as the code that
    invoked the traced operation: thus the <i>commandPrefix</i>, if invoked from
    a procedure, will have access to the same local variables as code in the
    procedure. This context may be different than the context in which the trace
    was created. If <i>commandPrefix</i> invokes a procedure (which it normally
    does) then the procedure will have to use <b>upvar</b> or <b>uplevel</b>
    commands if it wishes to access the local variables of the code which
    invoked the trace operation.</p>
<p class="Pp">While <i>commandPrefix</i> is executing during an execution trace,
    traces on <i>name</i> are temporarily disabled. This allows the
    <i>commandPrefix</i> to execute <i>name</i> in its body without invoking any
    other traces again. If an error occurs while executing the
    <i>commandPrefix</i>, then the command <i>name</i> as a whole will return
    that same error.</p>
<p class="Pp">When multiple traces are set on <i>name</i>, then for <i>enter</i>
    and <i>enterstep</i> operations, the traced commands are invoked in the
    reverse order of how the traces were originally created; and for
    <i>leave</i> and <i>leavestep</i> operations, the traced commands are
    invoked in the original order of creation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The behavior of execution traces is currently undefined for a
    command <i>name</i> imported into another namespace.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="trace~4"><a class="permalink" href="#trace~4"><b>trace add
    variable</b><i> name ops commandPrefix</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Arrange for <i>commandPrefix</i> to be executed whenever variable
      <i>name</i> is accessed in one of the ways given by the list <i>ops</i>.
      <i>Name</i> may refer to a normal variable, an element of an array, or to
      an array as a whole (i.e. <i>name</i> may be just the name of an array,
      with no parenthesized index). If <i>name</i> refers to a whole array, then
      <i>commandPrefix</i> is invoked whenever any element of the array is
      manipulated. If the variable does not exist, it will be created but will
      not be given a value, so it will be visible to <b>namespace which</b>
      queries, but not to <b>info exists</b> queries.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><i>Ops</i> indicates which operations are of interest, and is a
    list of one or more of the following items:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="array"><a class="permalink" href="#array"><b>array</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> whenever the variable is accessed or modified
      via the <b>array</b> command, provided that <i>name</i> is not a scalar
      variable at the time that the <b>array</b> command is invoked. If
      <i>name</i> is a scalar variable, the access via the <b>array</b> command
      will not trigger the trace.</dd>
  <dt id="read"><a class="permalink" href="#read"><b>read</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> whenever the variable is read.</dd>
  <dt id="write"><a class="permalink" href="#write"><b>write</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> whenever the variable is written.</dd>
  <dt id="unset"><a class="permalink" href="#unset"><b>unset</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Invoke <i>commandPrefix</i> whenever the variable is unset. Variables can
      be unset explicitly with the <b>unset</b> command, or implicitly when
      procedures return (all of their local variables are unset). Variables are
      also unset when interpreters are deleted, but traces will not be invoked
      because there is no interpreter in which to execute them.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When the trace triggers, three arguments are appended to
    <i>commandPrefix</i> so that the actual command is as follows:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>commandPrefix name1 name2 op</i>
</pre>
</div>
<i>Name1</i> and <i>name2</i> give the name(s) for the variable being accessed:
  if the variable is a scalar then <i>name1</i> gives the variable's name and
  <i>name2</i> is an empty string; if the variable is an array element then
  <i>name1</i> gives the name of the array and name2 gives the index into the
  array; if an entire array is being deleted and the trace was registered on the
  overall array, rather than a single element, then <i>name1</i> gives the array
  name and <i>name2</i> is an empty string. <i>Name1</i> and <i>name2</i> are
  not necessarily the same as the name used in the <b>trace variable</b>
  command: the <b>upvar</b> command allows a procedure to reference a variable
  under a different name. <i>Op</i> indicates what operation is being performed
  on the variable, and is one of <b>read</b>, <b>write</b>, or <b>unset</b> as
  defined above.
<p class="Pp"><i>CommandPrefix</i> executes in the same context as the code that
    invoked the traced operation: if the variable was accessed as part of a Tcl
    procedure, then <i>commandPrefix</i> will have access to the same local
    variables as code in the procedure. This context may be different than the
    context in which the trace was created. If <i>commandPrefix</i> invokes a
    procedure (which it normally does) then the procedure will have to use
    <b>upvar</b> or <b>uplevel</b> if it wishes to access the traced variable.
    Note also that <i>name1</i> may not necessarily be the same as the name used
    to set the trace on the variable; differences can occur if the access is
    made through a variable defined with the <b>upvar</b> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">For read and write traces, <i>commandPrefix</i> can modify the
    variable to affect the result of the traced operation. If
    <i>commandPrefix</i> modifies the value of a variable during a read or write
    trace, then the new value will be returned as the result of the traced
    operation. The return value from <i>commandPrefix</i> is ignored except that
    if it returns an error of any sort then the traced operation also returns an
    error with the same error message returned by the trace command (this
    mechanism can be used to implement read-only variables, for example). For
    write traces, <i>commandPrefix</i> is invoked after the variable's value has
    been changed; it can write a new value into the variable to override the
    original value specified in the write operation. To implement read-only
    variables, <i>commandPrefix</i> will have to restore the old value of the
    variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">While <i>commandPrefix</i> is executing during a read or write
    trace, traces on the variable are temporarily disabled. This means that
    reads and writes invoked by <i>commandPrefix</i> will occur directly,
    without invoking <i>commandPrefix</i> (or any other traces) again. However,
    if <i>commandPrefix</i> unsets the variable then unset traces will be
    invoked.</p>
<p class="Pp">When an unset trace is invoked, the variable has already been
    deleted: it will appear to be undefined with no traces. If an unset occurs
    because of a procedure return, then the trace will be invoked in the
    variable context of the procedure being returned to: the stack frame of the
    returning procedure will no longer exist. Traces are not disabled during
    unset traces, so if an unset trace command creates a new trace and accesses
    the variable, the trace will be invoked. Any errors in unset traces are
    ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there are multiple traces on a variable they are invoked in
    order of creation, most-recent first. If one trace returns an error, then no
    further traces are invoked for the variable. If an array element has a trace
    set, and there is also a trace set on the array as a whole, the trace on the
    overall array is invoked before the one on the element.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once created, the trace remains in effect either until the trace
    is removed with the <b>trace remove variable</b> command described below,
    until the variable is unset, or until the interpreter is deleted. Unsetting
    an element of array will remove any traces on that element, but will not
    remove traces on the overall array.</p>
<p class="Pp">This command returns an empty string.</p>
