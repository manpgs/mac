   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp"><i>doctoc</i> (short for <i>documentation tables of contents</i>)
    stands for a set of related, yet different, entities which are working
    together for the easy creation and transformation of tables of contents for
    documentation. These are</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>A tcl based language for the semantic markup of a table of contents.
      Markup is represented by Tcl commands.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>A package providing the ability to read and transform texts written in
      that markup language. It is important to note that the actual
      transformation of the input text is delegated to plugins.</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>An API describing the interface between the package above and a
    plugin.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Which of the more detailed documents are relevant to the reader of
    this introduction depends on their role in the documentation process.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>A <i>writer</i> of documentation has to understand the markup language
      itself. A beginner to doctoc should read the more informally written
      <i>doctoc language introduction</i> first. Having digested this the formal
      <i>doctoc language syntax</i> specification should become understandable.
      A writer experienced with doctoc may only need the <i>doctoc language
      command reference</i> from time to time to refresh her memory.
    <p class="Pp">While a document is written the <b>dtp</b> application can be
        used to validate it, and after completion it also performs the
        conversion into the chosen system of visual markup, be it *roff, HTML,
        plain text, wiki, etc. The simpler <b>dtplite</b> application makes
        internal use of doctoc when handling directories of documentation,
        automatically generating a proper table of contents for them.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>A <i>processor</i> of documentation written in the <i>doctoc</i> markup
      language has to know which tools are available for use.
    <p class="Pp">The main tool is the aforementioned <b>dtp</b> application
        provided by Tcllib. The simpler <b>dtplite</b> does not expose doctoc to
        the user. At the bottom level, common to both applications, however sits
        the package <b>doctoools::toc</b>, providing the basic facilities to
        read and process files containing text in the doctoc format.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>At last, but not least, <i>plugin writers</i> have to understand the
      interaction between the <b>doctools::toc</b> package and its plugins, as
      described in the <i>doctoc plugin API reference</i>.</dd>

<p class="Pp">doctoc does not stand alone, it has two companion formats. These
    are called <i>docidx</i> and <i>doctools</i>, and they are for the markup of
    <i>keyword indices</i>, and general documentation, respectively. They are
    described in their own sets of documents, starting at the <i>docidx
    introduction</i> and the <i>doctools introduction</i>, respectively.</p>
