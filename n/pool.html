   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">This package provides pool objects which can be used to manage
    finite collections of discrete items.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>::struct::pool</b> ?<i>poolName</i>? ?<i>maxsize</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Creates a new pool object. If no <i>poolName</i> is supplied, then the new
      pool will be named pool<b>X</b>, where X is a positive integer. The
      optional second argument <i>maxsize</i> has to be a positive integer
      indicating the maximum size of the pool; this is the maximum number of
      items the pool may hold. The default for this value is <b>10</b>.
    <p class="Pp">The pool object has an associated global Tcl command whose
        name is <i>poolName</i>. This command may be used to invoke various
        configuration operations on the report. It has the following general
        form:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="poolName"><a class="permalink" href="#poolName"><b>poolName</b>
    <i>option</i> ?<i>arg arg ...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd><i>Option</i> and the <i>arg</i>s determine the exact behavior of the
      command. See section <b>POOL OBJECT COMMAND</b> for a detailed list of
      options and their behaviour.</dd>

</div>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="POOLS_AND_ALLOCATION"><a class="permalink" href="#POOLS_AND_ALLOCATION">POOLS
  AND ALLOCATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The purpose of the pool command and the pool object command that
    it generates, is to manage pools of discrete items. Examples of a pool of
    discrete items are:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>the seats in a cinema, theatre, train etc.. for which visitors/travelers
      can make a reservation;</li>
  <li>the dynamic IP-addresses that an ISP can dole out to subscribers;</li>
  <li>a car rental's collection of cars, which can be rented by customers;</li>
  <li>the class rooms in a school building, which need to be scheduled;</li>
  <li>the database connections available to client-threads in a web-server
      application;</li>
  <li>the books in a library that customers can borrow;</li>
  <li>etc ...</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The common denominator in the examples is that there is a more or
    less fixed number of items (seats, IP-addresses, cars, ...) that are
    supposed to be allocated on a more or less regular basis. An item can be
    allocated only once at a time. An item that is allocated, must be released
    before it can be re-allocated. While several items in a pool are being
    allocated and released continuously, the total number of items in the pool
    remains constant.</p>
<p class="Pp">Keeping track of which items are allocated, and by whom, is the
    purpose of the pool command and its subordinates.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Pool parlance</i>: If we say that an item is <i>allocated</i>,
    it means that the item is <i>busy</i>, <i>owned</i> or <i>occupied</i>; it
    is not available anymore. If an item is <i>free</i>, it is <i>available</i>.
    Deallocating an item is equivalent to setting free or releasing an item. The
    person or entity to which the item has been allotted is said to own the
    item.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ITEMS"><a class="permalink" href="#ITEMS">ITEMS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>Discrete items</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>pool</b> command is designed for <i>discrete items
    only</i>. Note that there are pools where allocation occurs on a
    non-discrete basis, for example computer memory. There are also pools from
    which the shares that are doled out are not expected to be returned, for
    example a charity fund or a pan of soup from which you may receive a
    portion. Finally, there are even pools from which nothing is ever allocated
    or returned, like a swimming pool or a cesspool.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Unique item names</i></p>
<p class="Pp">A pool cannot manage duplicate item names. Therefore, items in a
    pool must have unique names.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Item equivalence</i></p>
<p class="Pp">From the point of view of the manager of a pool, items are
    equivalent. The manager of a pool is indifferent about which entity/person
    occupies a given item. However, clients may have preferences for a
    particular item, based on some item property they know.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Preferences</i></p>
<p class="Pp">A future owner may have a preference for a particular item.
    Preference based allocation is supported (see the <b>-prefer</b> option to
    the request subcommand). A preference for a particular item is most likely
    to result from variability among features associated with the items. Note
    that the pool commands themselves are not designed to manage such item
    properties. If item properties play a role in an application, they should be
    managed separately.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="POOL_OBJECT_COMMAND"><a class="permalink" href="#POOL_OBJECT_COMMAND">POOL
  OBJECT COMMAND</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The following subcommands and corresponding arguments are
    available to any pool object command.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="poolName~2"><a class="permalink" href="#poolName~2"><i>poolName</i>
    <b>add</b> <i>itemName1</i> ?<i>itemName2 itemName3 ...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>This command adds the items on the command line to the pool. If duplicate
      item names occur on the command line, an error is raised. If one or more
      of the items already exist in the pool, this also is considered an
    error.</dd>
  <dt id="poolName~3"><a class="permalink" href="#poolName~3"><i>poolName</i>
    <b>clear</b> ?<b>-force</b>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Removes all items from the pool. If there are any allocated items at the
      time when the command is invoked, an error is raised. This behaviour may
      be modified through the <b>-force</b> argument. If it is supplied on the
      command line, the pool will be cleared regardless the allocation state of
      its items.</dd>
  <dt id="poolName~4"><a class="permalink" href="#poolName~4"><i>poolName</i>
    <b>destroy</b> ?<b>-force</b>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Destroys the pool data structure, all associated variables and the
      associated pool object command. By default, the command checks whether any
      items are still allocated and raises an error if such is the case. This
      behaviour may be modified through the argument <b>-force</b>. If it is
      supplied on the command line, the pool data structure will be destroyed
      regardless allocation state of its items.</dd>
  <dt id="poolName~5"><a class="permalink" href="#poolName~5"><i>poolName</i>
    <b>info</b> <i>type</i> ?<i>arg</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Returns various information about the pool for further programmatic use.
      The <i>type</i> argument indicates the type of information requested. Only
      the type <b>allocID</b> uses an additional argument.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="allocID"><a class="permalink" href="#allocID"><b>allocID</b>
    <i>itemName</i></a></dt>
  <dd>returns the allocID of the item whose name is <i>itemName</i>. Free items
      have an allocation id of <b>-1</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="allitems"><a class="permalink" href="#allitems"><b>allitems</b></a></dt>
  <dd>returns a list of all items in the pool.</dd>
  <dt id="allocstate"><a class="permalink" href="#allocstate"><b>allocstate</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns a list of key-value pairs, where the keys are the items and the
      values are the corresponding allocation id's. Free items have an
      allocation id of <b>-1</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="cursize"><a class="permalink" href="#cursize"><b>cursize</b></a></dt>
  <dd>returns the current pool size, i.e. the number of items in the pool.</dd>
  <dt id="freeitems"><a class="permalink" href="#freeitems"><b>freeitems</b></a></dt>
  <dd>returns a list of items that currently are not allocated.</dd>
  <dt id="maxsize"><a class="permalink" href="#maxsize"><b>maxsize</b></a></dt>
  <dd>returns the maximum size of the pool.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="poolName~6"><a class="permalink" href="#poolName~6"><i>poolName</i>
    <b>maxsize</b> ?<i>maxsize</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Sets or queries the maximum size of the pool, depending on whether the
      <i>maxsize</i> argument is supplied or not. If <i>maxsize</i> is supplied,
      the maximum size of the pool will be set to that value. If no argument is
      supplied, the current maximum size of the pool is returned. In this
      variant, the command is an alias for:
    <p class="Pp"><b>poolName info maxsize</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <i>maxsize</i> argument has to be a positive integer.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="poolName~7"><a class="permalink" href="#poolName~7"><i>poolName</i>
    <b>release</b> <i>itemName</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Releases the item whose name is <i>itemName</i> that was allocated
      previously. An error is raised if the item was not allocated at the time
      when the command was issued.</dd>
  <dt id="poolName~8"><a class="permalink" href="#poolName~8"><i>poolName</i>
    <b>remove</b> <i>itemName</i> ?<b>-force</b>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Removes the item whose name is <i>itemName</i> from the pool. If the item
      was allocated at the time when the command was invoked, an error is
      raised. This behaviour may be modified through the optional argument
      <b>-force</b>. If it is supplied on the command line, the item will be
      removed regardless its allocation state.</dd>
  <dt id="poolName~9"><a class="permalink" href="#poolName~9"><i>poolName</i>
    <b>request</b> itemVar ?options?</a></dt>
  <dd>Handles a request for an item, taking into account a possible preference
      for a particular item. There are two possible outcomes depending on the
      availability of items:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>The request is honoured, an item is allocated and the variable whose name
      is passed with the argument <i>itemVar</i> will be set to the name of the
      item that was allocated. The command returns 1.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>The request is denied. No item is allocated. The variable whose name is
      itemVar is not set. Attempts to read <i>itemVar</i> may raise an error if
      the variable was not defined before issuing the request. The command
      returns 0.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The return values from this command are meant to be inspected. The
    examples below show how to do this. Failure to check the return value may
    result in erroneous behaviour. If no preference for a particular item is
    supplied through the option <b>-prefer</b> (see below), then all requests
    are honoured as long as items are available.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following options are supported:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="allocID~2"><a class="permalink" href="#allocID~2"><b>-allocID</b>
    <i>allocID</i></a></dt>
  <dd>If the request is honoured, an item will be allocated to the entity
      identified by allocID. If the allocation state of an item is queried, it
      is this allocation ID that will be returned. If the option <b>-allocID</b>
      is not supplied, the item will be given to and owned by <b>dummyID</b>.
      Allocation id's may be anything except the value -1, which is reserved for
      free items.</dd>
  <dt id="prefer"><a class="permalink" href="#prefer"><b>-prefer</b>
    <i>preferredItem</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This option modifies the allocation strategy as follows: If the item whose
      name is <i>preferredItem</i> is not allocated at the time when the command
      is invoked, the request is honoured (return value is 1). If the item was
      allocated at the time when the command was invoked, the request is denied
      (return value is 0).</dd>
</dl>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Two examples are provided. The first one mimics a step by step
    interactive tclsh session, where each step is explained. The second example
    shows the usage in a server application that talks to a back-end
    application.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Example 1</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This example presents an interactive tclsh session which considers
    the case of a Car rental's collection of cars. Ten steps explain its usage
    in chronological order, from the creation of the pool, via the most
    important stages in the usage of a pool, to the final destruction.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Note aside:</i></p>
<p class="Pp">In this example, brand names are used to label the various items.
    However, a brand name could be regarded as a property of an item. Because
    the pool command is not designed to manage properties of items, they need to
    be managed separately. In the latter case the items should be labeled with
    more neutral names such as: car1, car2, car3 , etc ... and a separate
    database or array should hold the brand names associated with the car
    labels.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
     1. Load the package into an interpreter
     % package require pool
     0.1
     2. Create a pool object called `CarPool' with a maximum size of 55 items (cars):
     % pool CarPool 55
     CarPool
     4. Add items to the pool:
     % CarPool add Toyota Trabant Chrysler1 Chrysler2 Volkswagen
     5. Somebody crashed the Toyota. Remove it from the pool as follows:
     % CarPool remove Toyota
     6. Acquired a new car for the pool. Add it as follows:
     % CarPool add Nissan
     7. Check whether the pool was adjusted correctly:
     % CarPool info allitems
     Trabant Chrysler1 Chrysler2 Volkswagen Nissan
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Suspend the interactive session temporarily, and show the
    programmatic use of the request subcommand:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
     # Mrs. Swift needs a car. She doesn't have a preference for a
     # particular car. We'll issue a request on her behalf as follows:
     if { [CarPool request car -allocID &quot;Mrs. Swift&quot;] }  {
         # request was honoured, process the variable `car'
         puts &quot;$car has been allocated to [CarPool info allocID $car].&quot;
     } else {
         # request was denied
          puts &quot;No car available.&quot;
     }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note how the <b>if</b> command uses the value returned by the
    <b>request</b> subcommand.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
     # Suppose Mr. Wiggly has a preference for the Trabant:
     if { [CarPool request car -allocID &quot;Mr. Wiggly&quot; -prefer Trabant] }  {
         # request was honoured, process the variable `car'
         puts &quot;$car has been allocated to [CarPool info allocID $car].&quot;
     } else {
         # request was denied
          puts &quot;The Trabant was not available.&quot;
     }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Resume the interactive session:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
     8. When the car is returned then you can render it available by:
     % CarPool release Trabant
     9. When done, you delete the pool.
     % CarPool destroy
     Couldn't destroy `CarPool' because some items are still allocated.
     Oops, forgot that Mrs. Swift still occupies a car.
     10. We force the destruction of the pool as follows:
     % CarPool destroy -force
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Example 2</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This example describes the case from which the author's need for
    pool management originated. It is an example of a server application that
    receives requests from client applications. The client requests are
    dispatched onto a back-end application before being returned to the client
    application. In many cases there are a few equivalent instances of back-end
    applications to which a client request may be passed along. The file
    descriptors that identify the channels to these back-end instances make up a
    pool of connections. A particular connection may be allocated to just one
    client request at a time.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
     # Create the pool of connections (pipes)
     set maxpipes 10
     pool Pipes $maxpipes
     for {set i 0} {$i &lt; $maxpipes} {incr i} {
         set fd [open &quot;|backendApplication&quot; w+]
         Pipes add $fd
     }
     # A client request comes in. The request is identified as `clientX'.
     # Dispatch it onto an instance of a back-end application
     if { [Pipes request fd -allocID clientX] } {
         # a connection was allocated
         # communicate to the back-end application via the variable `fd'
         puts $fd &quot;someInstruction&quot;
         # ...... etc.
     } else {
         # all connections are currently occupied
         # store the client request in a queue for later processing,
         # or return a 'Server busy' message to the client.
