   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp"><b>tk_focusNext</b> is a utility procedure used for keyboard
    traversal. It returns the &#x201C;next&#x201D; window after <i>window</i> in
    focus order. The focus order is determined by the stacking order of windows
    and the structure of the window hierarchy. Among siblings, the focus order
    is the same as the stacking order, with the lowest window being first. If a
    window has children, the window is visited first, followed by its children
    (recursively), followed by its next sibling. Top-level windows other than
    <i>window</i> are skipped, so that <b>tk_focusNext</b> never returns a
    window in a different top-level from <i>window</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">After computing the next window, <b>tk_focusNext</b> examines the
    window's <b>-takefocus</b> option to see whether it should be skipped. If
    so, <b>tk_focusNext</b> continues on to the next window in the focus order,
    until it eventually finds a window that will accept the focus or returns
    back to <i>window</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>tk_focusPrev</b> is similar to <b>tk_focusNext</b> except that
    it returns the window just before <i>window</i> in the focus order.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>tk_focusFollowsMouse</b> changes the focus model for the
    application to an implicit one where the window under the mouse gets the
    focus. After this procedure is called, whenever the mouse enters a window Tk
    will automatically give it the input focus. The <b>focus</b> command may be
    used to move the focus to a window other than the one under the mouse, but
    as soon as the mouse moves into a new window the focus will jump to that
    window. Note: at present there is no built-in support for returning the
    application to an explicit focus model; to do this you will have to write a
    script that deletes the bindings created by <b>tk_focusFollowsMouse</b>.</p>
