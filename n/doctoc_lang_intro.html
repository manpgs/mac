   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This document is an informal introduction to version 1.1 of the
    doctoc markup language based on a multitude of examples. After reading this
    a writer should be ready to understand the two parts of the formal
    specification, i.e. the <i>doctoc language syntax</i> specification and the
    <i>doctoc language command reference</i>.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="FUNDAMENTALS"><a class="permalink" href="#FUNDAMENTALS">FUNDAMENTALS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">While the <i>doctoc markup language</i> is quite similar to the
    <i>doctools markup language</i>, in the broadest terms possible, there is
    one key difference. A table of contents consists essentially only of markup
    commands, with no plain text interspersed between them, except for
    whitespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each markup command is a Tcl command surrounded by a matching pair
    of <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>. Inside of these delimiters the usual rules for a
    Tcl command apply with regard to word quotation, nested commands,
    continuation lines, etc. I.e.</p>

</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="BASIC_STRUCTURE"><a class="permalink" href="#BASIC_STRUCTURE">BASIC
  STRUCTURE</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The most simple document which can be written in doctoc is</p>
<pre>
    [toc_begin GROUPTITLE TITLE]
    [toc_end]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This also shows us that all doctoc documents consist of only one
    part where we will list <i>items</i> and <i>divisions</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The user is free to mix these as she sees fit. This is a change
    from version 1 of the language, which did not allow this mixing, but only
    the use of either a series of items or a series of divisions.</p>
<p class="Pp">We will discuss the commands for each of these two possibilities
    in the next sections.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="ITEMS"><a class="permalink" href="#ITEMS">ITEMS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Use the command <b>item</b> to put an <i>item</i> into a table of
    contents. This is essentially a reference to a section, subsection, etc. in
    the document, or set of documents, the table of contents is for. The command
    takes three arguments, a symbolic name for the file the item is for and two
    text to label the item and describe the referenced section.</p>
<p class="Pp">Symbolic names are used to preserve the convertibility of this
    format to any output format. The actual name of any file will be inserted by
    the chosen formatting engine when converting the input, based on a mapping
    from symbolic to actual names given to the engine.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here a made up example for a table of contents of this
  document:</p>
<pre>
[toc_begin Doctoc {Language Introduction}]
[<b>item 1 DESCRIPTION</b>]
[<b>item 1.1 {Basic structure}</b>]
[<b>item 1.2 Items</b>]
[<b>item 1.3 Divisions</b>]
[<b>item 2 {FURTHER READING}</b>]
[toc_end]
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="DIVISIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#DIVISIONS">DIVISIONS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">One thing of notice in the last example in the previous section is
    that the referenced sections actually had a nested structure, something
    which was expressed in the item labels, by using a common prefix for all the
    sections nested under section 1.</p>
<p class="Pp">This kind of structure can be made more explicit in the doctoc
    language by using divisions. Instead of using a series of plain items we use
    a series of divisions for the major references, and then place the nested
    items inside of these.</p>
<p class="Pp">Of course, instead of the nested items we can again use divisions
    and thus nest arbitrarily deep.</p>
<p class="Pp">A division is marked by two commands instead of one, one to start
    it, the other to close the last opened division. They are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="division_start"><a class="permalink" href="#division_start"><b>division_start</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This command opens a new division. It takes one or two arguments, the
      title of the division, and the symbolic name of the file it refers to. The
      latter is optional. If the symbolic filename is present then the section
      title should link to the referenced document, if links are supported by
      the output format.</dd>
  <dt id="division_end"><a class="permalink" href="#division_end"><b>division_end</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This command closes the last opened and not yet closed division.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Using this we can recast the last example like this</p>
<pre>
[toc_begin Doctoc {Language Introduction}]
[<b>division_start DESCRIPTION</b>]
[item 1 {Basic structure}]
[item 2 Items]
[item 3 Divisions]
[<b>division_end</b>]
[<b>division_start {FURTHER READING}</b>]
[<b>division_end</b>]
[toc_end]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or, to demonstrate deeper nesting</p>
<pre>
[toc_begin Doctoc {Language Introduction}]
[<b>division_start DESCRIPTION</b>]
[<b>division_start {Basic structure}</b>]
[item 1 Do]
[item 2 Re]
[<b>division_end</b>]
[<b>division_start Items</b>]
[item a Fi]
[item b Fo]
[item c Fa]
[<b>division_end</b>]
[<b>division_start Divisions</b>]
[item 1 Sub]
[item 1 Zero]
[<b>division_end</b>]
[<b>division_end</b>]
[<b>division_start {FURTHER READING}</b>]
[<b>division_end</b>]
[toc_end]
</pre>
And do not forget, it is possible to freely mix items and divisions, and to have
  empty divisions.
<pre>
[toc_begin Doctoc {Language Introduction}]
[item 1 Do]
[<b>division_start DESCRIPTION</b>]
[<b>division_start {Basic structure}</b>]
[item 2 Re]
[<b>division_end</b>]
[item a Fi]
[<b>division_start Items</b>]
[item b Fo]
[item c Fa]
[<b>division_end</b>]
[<b>division_start Divisions</b>]
[<b>division_end</b>]
[<b>division_end</b>]
[<b>division_start {FURTHER READING}</b>]
[<b>division_end</b>]
[toc_end]
</pre>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="ADVANCED_STRUCTURE"><a class="permalink" href="#ADVANCED_STRUCTURE">ADVANCED
  STRUCTURE</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In all previous examples we fudged a bit regarding the markup
    actually allowed to be used before the <b>toc_begin</b> command opening the
    document.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of only whitespace the two templating commands
    <b>include</b> and <b>vset</b> are also allowed, to enable the writer to
    either set and/or import configuration settings relevant to the table of
    contents. I.e. it is possible to write</p>
<pre>
[<b>include FILE</b>]
[<b>vset VAR VALUE</b>]
[toc_begin GROUPTITLE TITLE]
[toc_end]
</pre>
Even more important, these two commands are allowed anywhere where a markup
  command is allowed, without regard for any other structure.
<pre>
[toc_begin GROUPTITLE TITLE]
[<b>include FILE</b>]
[<b>vset VAR VALUE</b>]
[toc_end]
</pre>
The only restriction <b>include</b> has to obey is that the contents of the
  included file must be valid at the place of the inclusion. I.e. a file
  included before <b>toc_begin</b> may contain only the templating commands
  <b>vset</b> and <b>include</b>, a file included in a division may contain only
  items or divisions commands, etc.

<h2 class="Ss" id="ESCAPES"><a class="permalink" href="#ESCAPES">ESCAPES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Beyond the 6 commands shown so far we have two more available.
    However their function is not the marking up of toc structure, but the
    insertion of characters, namely <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>. These commands,
    <b>lb</b> and <b>rb</b> respectively, are required because our use of [ and
    ] to bracket markup commands makes it impossible to directly use [ and ]
    within the text.</p>
<p class="Pp">Our example of their use are the sources of the last sentence in
    the previous paragraph, with some highlighting added.</p>
<pre>
  ...
  These commands, [cmd lb] and [cmd lb] respectively, are required
  because our use of [<b>lb</b>] and [<b>rb</b>] to bracket markup commands makes it
  impossible to directly use [<b>lb</b>] and [<b>rb</b>] within the text.

<h1 class="Sh" id="FURTHER_READING"><a class="permalink" href="#FURTHER_READING">FURTHER
  READING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Now that this document has been digested the reader, assumed to be
    a <i>writer</i> of documentation should be fortified enough to be able to
    understand the formal <i>doctoc language syntax</i> specification as well.
    From here on out the <i>doctoc language command reference</i> will also
    serve as the detailed specification and cheat sheet for all available
    commands and their syntax.</p>
<p class="Pp">To be able to validate a document while writing it, it is also
    recommended to familiarize oneself with Tclapps' ultra-configurable
    <b>dtp</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the other hand, doctoc is perfectly suited for the automatic
    generation from doctools documents, and this is the route Tcllib's easy and
    simple <b>dtplite</b> goes, creating a table of contents for a set of
    documents behind the scenes, without the writer having to do so on their
    own.</p>
