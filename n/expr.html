   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">Concatenates <i>arg</i>s (adding separator spaces between them),
    evaluates the result as a Tcl expression, and returns the value. The
    operators permitted in Tcl expressions include a subset of the operators
    permitted in C expressions. For those operators common to both Tcl and C,
    Tcl applies the same meaning and precedence as the corresponding C
    operators. Expressions almost always yield numeric results (integer or
    floating-point values). For example, the expression</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>expr 8.2 + 6</b>
</pre>
</div>
evaluates to 14.2. Tcl expressions differ from C expressions in the way that
  operands are specified. Also, Tcl expressions support non-numeric operands and
  string comparisons, as well as some additional operators not found in C.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="OPERANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPERANDS">OPERANDS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A Tcl expression consists of a combination of operands, operators,
    and parentheses. White space may be used between the operands and operators
    and parentheses; it is ignored by the expression's instructions. Where
    possible, operands are interpreted as integer values. Integer values may be
    specified in decimal (the normal case), in binary (if the first two
    characters of the operand are <b>0b</b>), in octal (if the first two
    characters of the operand are <b>0o</b>), or in hexadecimal (if the first
    two characters of the operand are <b>0x</b>). For compatibility with older
    Tcl releases, an octal integer value is also indicated simply when the first
    character of the operand is <b>0</b>, whether or not the second character is
    also <b>o</b>. If an operand does not have one of the integer formats given
    above, then it is treated as a floating-point number if that is possible.
    Floating-point numbers may be specified in any of several common formats
    making use of the decimal digits, the decimal point <b>.</b>, the characters
    <b>e</b> or <b>E</b> indicating scientific notation, and the sign characters
    <b>+</b> or <b>-</b>. For example, all of the following are valid
    floating-point numbers: 2.1, 3., 6e4, 7.91e+16. Also recognized as floating
    point values are the strings <b>Inf</b> and <b>NaN</b> making use of any
    case for each character. If no numeric interpretation is possible (note that
    all literal operands that are not numeric or boolean must be quoted with
    either braces or with double quotes), then an operand is left as a string
    (and only a limited set of operators may be applied to it).</p>
<p class="Pp">Operands may be specified in any of the following ways:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>As a numeric value, either integer or floating-point.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>As a boolean value, using any form understood by <b>string is
    boolean</b>.</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>As a Tcl variable, using standard <b>$</b> notation. The variable's value
      will be used as the operand.</dd>
  <dt>[4]</dt>
  <dd>As a string enclosed in double-quotes. The expression parser will perform
      backslash, variable, and command substitutions on the information between
      the quotes, and use the resulting value as the operand</dd>
  <dt>[5]</dt>
  <dd>As a string enclosed in braces. The characters between the open brace and
      matching close brace will be used as the operand without any
      substitutions.</dd>
  <dt>[6]</dt>
  <dd>As a Tcl command enclosed in brackets. The command will be executed and
      its result will be used as the operand.</dd>
  <dt>[7]</dt>
  <dd>As a mathematical function whose arguments have any of the above forms for
      operands, such as <b>sin($x)</b>. See <b>MATH FUNCTIONS</b> below for a
      discussion of how mathematical functions are handled.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Where the above substitutions occur (e.g. inside quoted strings),
    they are performed by the expression's instructions. However, the command
    parser may already have performed one round of substitution before the
    expression processor was called. As discussed below, it is usually best to
    enclose expressions in braces to prevent the command parser from performing
    substitutions on the contents.</p>
<p class="Pp">For some examples of simple expressions, suppose the variable
    <b>a</b> has the value 3 and the variable <b>b</b> has the value 6. Then the
    command on the left side of each of the lines below will produce the value
    on the right side of the line:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>expr</b> 3.1 + $a	<i>6.1</i>
<b>expr</b> 2 + &quot;$a.$b&quot;	<i>5.6</i>
<b>expr</b> 4*[llength &quot;6 2&quot;]	<i>8</i>
<b>expr</b> {{word one} &lt; &quot;word $a&quot;}	<i>0</i>
</pre>
</div>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="OPERATORS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPERATORS">OPERATORS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The valid operators (most of which are also available as commands
    in the <b>tcl::mathop</b> namespace; see the <b>mathop</b>(n) manual page
    for details) are listed below, grouped in decreasing order of
  precedence:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-&#x00A0;&#x00A0;+&#x00A0;&#x00A0;~&#x00A0;&#x00A0;!</b></dt>
  <dd>Unary minus, unary plus, bit-wise NOT, logical NOT. None of these
      operators may be applied to string operands, and bit-wise NOT may be
      applied only to integers.</dd>
  <dt><b>**</b></dt>
  <dd>Exponentiation. Valid for any numeric operands.</dd>
  <dt><b>*&#x00A0;&#x00A0;/&#x00A0;&#x00A0;%</b></dt>
  <dd>Multiply, divide, remainder. None of these operators may be applied to
      string operands, and remainder may be applied only to integers. The
      remainder will always have the same sign as the divisor and an absolute
      value smaller than the divisor.</dd>
  <dt><b>+&#x00A0;&#x00A0;-</b></dt>
  <dd>Add and subtract. Valid for any numeric operands.</dd>
  <dt><b>&lt;&lt;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&gt;&gt;</b></dt>
  <dd>Left and right shift. Valid for integer operands only. A right shift
      always propagates the sign bit.</dd>
  <dt><b>&lt;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&gt;&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&lt;=&#x00A0;&#x00A0;&gt;=</b></dt>
  <dd>Boolean less, greater, less than or equal, and greater than or equal. Each
      operator produces 1 if the condition is true, 0 otherwise. These operators
      may be applied to strings as well as numeric operands, in which case
      string comparison is used.</dd>
  <dt><b>==&#x00A0;&#x00A0;!=</b></dt>
  <dd>Boolean equal and not equal. Each operator produces a zero/one result.
      Valid for all operand types.</dd>
  <dt id="eq"><a class="permalink" href="#eq"><b>eq&#x00A0;&#x00A0;ne</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Boolean string equal and string not equal. Each operator produces a
      zero/one result. The operand types are interpreted only as strings.</dd>
  <dt id="in"><a class="permalink" href="#in"><b>in&#x00A0;&#x00A0;ni</b></a></dt>
  <dd>List containment and negated list containment. Each operator produces a
      zero/one result and treats its first argument as a string and its second
      argument as a Tcl list. The <b>in</b> operator indicates whether the first
      argument is a member of the second argument list; the <b>ni</b> operator
      inverts the sense of the result.</dd>
  <dt><b>&amp;</b></dt>
  <dd>Bit-wise AND. Valid for integer operands only.</dd>
  <dt><b>^</b></dt>
  <dd>Bit-wise exclusive OR. Valid for integer operands only.</dd>
  <dt><b>|</b></dt>
  <dd>Bit-wise OR. Valid for integer operands only.</dd>
  <dt><b>&amp;&amp;</b></dt>
  <dd>Logical AND. Produces a 1 result if both operands are non-zero, 0
      otherwise. Valid for boolean and numeric (integers or floating-point)
      operands only.</dd>
  <dt><b>||</b></dt>
  <dd>Logical OR. Produces a 0 result if both operands are zero, 1 otherwise.
      Valid for boolean and numeric (integers or floating-point) operands
    only.</dd>
  <dt id="x"><a class="permalink" href="#x"><i>x</i><b>?</b><i>y</i><b>:</b><i>z</i></a></dt>
  <dd>If-then-else, as in C. If <i>x</i> evaluates to non-zero, then the result
      is the value of <i>y</i>. Otherwise the result is the value of <i>z</i>.
      The <i>x</i> operand must have a boolean or numeric value.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">See the C manual for more details on the results produced by each
    operator. The exponentiation operator promotes types like the multiply and
    divide operators, and produces a result that is the same as the output of
    the <b>pow</b> function (after any type conversions.) All of the binary
    operators group left-to-right within the same precedence level. For example,
    the command</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>expr</b> {4*2 &lt; 7}
</pre>
</div>
returns 0.
<p class="Pp">The <b>&amp;&amp;</b>, <b>||</b>, and <b>?:</b> operators have
    &#x201C;lazy evaluation&#x201D;, just as in C, which means that operands are
    not evaluated if they are not needed to determine the outcome. For example,
    in the command</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>expr {$v ? [a] : [b]}</b>
</pre>
</div>
only one of &#x201C;<b>[a]</b>&#x201D; or &#x201C;<b>[b]</b>&#x201D; will
  actually be evaluated, depending on the value of <b>$v</b>. Note, however,
  that this is only true if the entire expression is enclosed in braces;
  otherwise the Tcl parser will evaluate both &#x201C;<b>[a]</b>&#x201D; and
  &#x201C;<b>[b]</b>&#x201D; before invoking the <b>expr</b> command.

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="MATH_FUNCTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#MATH_FUNCTIONS">MATH
  FUNCTIONS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When the expression parser encounters a mathematical function such
    as <b>sin($x)</b>, it replaces it with a call to an ordinary Tcl function in
    the <b>tcl::mathfunc</b> namespace. The processing of an expression such
  as:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>expr {sin($x+$y)}</b>
</pre>
</div>
is the same in every way as the processing of:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>expr {[tcl::mathfunc::sin [expr {$x+$y}]]}</b>
</pre>
</div>
which in turn is the same as the processing of:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>tcl::mathfunc::sin [expr {$x+$y}]</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The executor will search for <b>tcl::mathfunc::sin</b> using the
    usual rules for resolving functions in namespaces. Either
    <b>::tcl::mathfunc::sin</b> or <b>[namespace</b>
    <b>current]::tcl::mathfunc::sin</b> will satisfy the request, and others may
    as well (depending on the current <b>namespace path</b> setting).</p>
<p class="Pp">See the <b>mathfunc</b>(n) manual page for the math functions that
    are available by default.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="TYPES,_OVERFLOW,_AND_PRECISION"><a class="permalink" href="#TYPES,_OVERFLOW,_AND_PRECISION">TYPES,
  OVERFLOW, AND PRECISION</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">All internal computations involving integers are done calling on
    the LibTomMath multiple precision integer library as required so that all
    integer calculations are performed exactly. Note that in Tcl releases prior
    to 8.5, integer calculations were performed with one of the C types <i>long
    int</i> or <i>Tcl_WideInt</i>, causing implicit range truncation in those
    calculations where values overflowed the range of those types. Any code that
    relied on these implicit truncations will need to explicitly add
    <b>int()</b> or <b>wide()</b> function calls to expressions at the points
    where such truncation is required to take place.</p>
<p class="Pp">All internal computations involving floating-point are done with
    the C type <i>double</i>. When converting a string to floating-point,
    exponent overflow is detected and results in the <i>double</i> value of
    <b>Inf</b> or <b>-Inf</b> as appropriate. Floating-point overflow and
    underflow are detected to the degree supported by the hardware, which is
    generally pretty reliable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Conversion among internal representations for integer,
    floating-point, and string operands is done automatically as needed. For
    arithmetic computations, integers are used until some floating-point number
    is introduced, after which floating-point is used. For example,</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>expr</b> {5 / 4}
</pre>
</div>
returns 1, while
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>expr</b> {5 / 4.0}
<b>expr</b> {5 / ( [string length &quot;abcd&quot;] + 0.0 )}
</pre>
</div>
both return 1.25. Floating-point values are always returned with a
  &#x201C;<b>.</b>&#x201D; or an &#x201C;<b>e</b>&#x201D; so that they will not
  look like integer values. For example,
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>expr</b> {20.0/5.0}
</pre>
</div>
returns <b>4.0</b>, not <b>4</b>.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="STRING_OPERATIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#STRING_OPERATIONS">STRING
  OPERATIONS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">String values may be used as operands of the comparison operators,
    although the expression evaluator tries to do comparisons as integer or
    floating-point when it can, except in the case of the <b>eq</b> and
    <b>ne</b> operators. If one of the operands of a comparison is a string and
    the other has a numeric value, a canonical string representation of the
    numeric operand value is generated to compare with the string operand.
    Canonical string representation for integer values is a decimal string
    format. Canonical string representation for floating-point values is that
    produced by the <b>%g</b> format specifier of Tcl's <b>format</b> command.
    For example, the commands</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>expr {&quot;0x03&quot; &gt; &quot;2&quot;}</b>
<b>expr {&quot;0y&quot; &lt; &quot;0x12&quot;}</b>
</pre>
</div>
both return 1. The first comparison is done using integer comparison, and the
  second is done using string comparison after the second operand is converted
  to the string <b>18</b>. Because of Tcl's tendency to treat values as numbers
  whenever possible, it is not generally a good idea to use operators like
  <b>==</b> when you really want string comparison and the values of the
  operands could be arbitrary; it is better in these cases to use the <b>eq</b>
  or <b>ne</b> operators, or the <b>string</b> command instead.

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PERFORMANCE_CONSIDERATIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#PERFORMANCE_CONSIDERATIONS">PERFORMANCE
  CONSIDERATIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Enclose expressions in braces for the best speed and the smallest
    storage requirements. This allows the Tcl bytecode compiler to generate the
    best code.</p>
<p class="Pp">As mentioned above, expressions are substituted twice: once by the
    Tcl parser and once by the <b>expr</b> command. For example, the
  commands</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>set a 3</b>
<b>set b {$a + 2}</b>
<b>expr $b*4</b>
</pre>
</div>
return 11, not a multiple of 4. This is because the Tcl parser will first
  substitute <b>$a + 2</b> for the variable <b>b</b>, then the <b>expr</b>
  command will evaluate the expression <b>$a + 2*4</b>.
<p class="Pp">Most expressions do not require a second round of substitutions.
    Either they are enclosed in braces or, if not, their variable and command
    substitutions yield numbers or strings that do not themselves require
    substitutions. However, because a few unbraced expressions need two rounds
    of substitutions, the bytecode compiler must emit additional instructions to
    handle this situation. The most expensive code is required for unbraced
    expressions that contain command substitutions. These expressions must be
    implemented by generating new code each time the expression is executed.
    When the expression is unbraced to allow the substitution of a function or
    operator, consider using the commands documented in the <b>mathfunc</b>(n)
    or <b>mathop</b>(n) manual pages directly instead.</p>
