   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">The command <b>transform</b> reflects the API for a stack channel
    transformation into the tcl level, thus enabling the writing of
    transformations in tcl.</p>

  <dd>This option is accepted by the command if and only if it is used in
      <i>immediate</i> mode. See section <b>IMMEDIATE versus ATTACHED</b> for an
      explanation of the term.
    <p class="Pp">The argument value specifies whether to run the read or the
        write part of the transformation specified via option <b>-command</b> on
        the immediate data.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Beyond the argument values listed above all unique

  </dd>
  <dt id="command"><a class="permalink" href="#command"><b>-command</b>
    <i>cmd</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This option has to be present and is always understood. Its argument is a
      command prefix. This command prefix will be called by internally whenever
      some operation of the transformation has to be executed. An empty
      <i>cmd</i> is not allowed.
    <p class="Pp">The exact nature of the various possible calls and their
        expected results is described later, in section <b>CALLBACK API</b>.</p>

  <dt id="attach"><a class="permalink" href="#attach"><b>-attach</b>

  <dd>The presence/absence of this option determines the main operation mode of

    <p class="Pp">If present the transformation will be stacked onto the
        <i>channel</i> whose handle was given to the option and run in
        <i>attached</i> mode. More about this in section <b>IMMEDIATE versus
        ATTACHED</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the option is absent the transformation is used in

  <dt id="in"><a class="permalink" href="#in"><b>-in</b> <i>channel</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This options is legal if and only if the transformation is used in
      <i>immediate</i> mode. It provides the handle of the channel the data to
      transform has to be read from.
    <p class="Pp">If the transformation is in <i>immediate</i> mode and this
        option is absent the data to transform is expected as the last argument
        to the transformation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="out"><a class="permalink" href="#out"><b>-out</b>
    <i>channel</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This options is legal if and only if the transformation is used in
      <i>immediate</i> mode. It provides the handle of the channel the generated
      transformation result is written to.
    <p class="Pp">If the transformation is in <i>immediate</i> mode and this
        option is absent the generated data is returned as the result of the
        command itself.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="IMMEDIATE_VERSUS_ATTACHED"><a class="permalink" href="#IMMEDIATE_VERSUS_ATTACHED">IMMEDIATE
  VERSUS ATTACHED</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The transformation distinguishes between two main ways of using
    it. These are the <i>immediate</i> and <i>attached</i> operation modes.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the <i>attached</i> mode the option <b>-attach</b> is used to
    associate the transformation with an existing channel. During the execution
    of the command no transformation is performed, instead the channel is
    changed in such a way, that from then on all data written to or read from it
    passes through the transformation and is modified by it according to the
    definition above. This attachment can be revoked by executing the command
    <b>unstack</b> for the chosen channel. This is the only way to do this at
    the Tcl level.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the second mode, which can be detected by the absence of option
    <b>-attach</b>, the transformation immediately takes data from either its
    commandline or a channel, transforms it, and returns the result either as
    result of the command, or writes it into a channel. The mode is named after
    the immediate nature of its execution.</p>
<p class="Pp">Where the data is taken from, and delivered to, is governed by the
    presence and absence of the options <b>-in</b> and <b>-out</b>. It should be
    noted that this ability to immediately read from and/or write to a channel
    is an historic artifact which was introduced at the beginning of Trf's life
    when Tcl version 7.6 was current as this and earlier versions have trouble
    to deal with \0 characters embedded into either input or output.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CALLBACK_API"><a class="permalink" href="#CALLBACK_API">CALLBACK
  API</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Here we describe the API of the callback command implementing the
    actual transformation.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="callback"><a class="permalink" href="#callback"><b>callback</b>
    <i>operation</i> <i>data</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The callback is always called with two arguments, first an operation code
      followed by data. The latter will be empty for some operations.
    <p class="Pp">The known operations are listed below, together with an
        explanation of the arguments, what is expected of them, and how their
        results are handled.</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="create/write"><a class="permalink" href="#create/write"><b>create/write</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When called <i>data</i> is empty. The result of the call is ignored.
    <p class="Pp">This is the first operation executed for the write side of the
        transformation. It has to initialize the internals of this part of the
        transformation and ready it for future calls.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="delete/write"><a class="permalink" href="#delete/write"><b>delete/write</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When called <i>data</i> is empty. The result of the call is ignored.
    <p class="Pp">This is the last operation executed for the write side of the
        transformation. It has to shutdown the internals of this part of the
        transformation and release any resources which were acquired over the
        lifetime of the transformation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="write"><a class="permalink" href="#write"><b>write</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The operation is called whenever data is written to the channel.
    <p class="Pp">At the time of the call the argument <i>data</i> will contain
        the bytes to transform. The result of the call is taken as the result of
        the transformation and handed to the next stage down in the stack of
        transformation associated with the channel.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This operation has to transform the contents of <i>data</i>,
        using whatever data was left over from the last call of the operation.
        The transformation is allowed to buffer incomplete data.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="flush/write"><a class="permalink" href="#flush/write"><b>flush/write</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When called <i>data</i> is empty. The operation has to transform any
      incomplete data it has buffered internally on the write side. The result
      of the call is taken as the result of the transformation and handed to the
      next stage down in the stack of transformation associated with the
      channel.</dd>
  <dt id="clear/write"><a class="permalink" href="#clear/write"><b>clear/write</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When called <i>data</i> is empty. The result of the call is ignored.
    <p class="Pp">The write side of the transformation has to clear its internal
        buffers. This operation is called when the user seeks on the channel,
        thus invalidating any incomplete transformation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="create/read"><a class="permalink" href="#create/read"><b>create/read</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When called <i>data</i> is empty. The result of the call is ignored.
    <p class="Pp">This is the first operation executed for the read side of the
        transformation. It has to initialize the internals of this part of the
        transformation and ready it for future calls.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="delete/read"><a class="permalink" href="#delete/read"><b>delete/read</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When called <i>data</i> is empty. The result of the call is ignored.
    <p class="Pp">This is the last operation executed for the write side of the
        transformation. It has to shutdown the internals of this part of the
        transformation and release any resources which were acquired over the
        lifetime of the transformation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="read"><a class="permalink" href="#read"><b>read</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The operation is called whenever data is read from the channel.
    <p class="Pp">At the time of the call the argument <i>data</i> will contain
        the bytes to transform. The result of the call is taken as the result of
        the transformation and posted to the next stage up in the stack of
        transformation associated with the channel.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This operation has to transform the contents of <i>data</i>,
        using whatever data was left over from the last call of the operation.
        The transformation is allowed to buffer incomplete data.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="flush/read"><a class="permalink" href="#flush/read"><b>flush/read</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When called <i>data</i> is empty. The operation has to transform any
      incomplete data it has buffered internally on the read side. The result of
      the call is taken as the result of the transformation and posted to the
      next stage up in the stack of transformation associated with the
    channel.</dd>
  <dt id="clear/read"><a class="permalink" href="#clear/read"><b>clear/read</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When called <i>data</i> is empty. The result of the call is ignored.
    <p class="Pp">The read side of the transformation has to clear its internal
        buffers. This operation is called when the user seeks on the channel,
        thus invalidating any incomplete transformation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="query/maxRead"><a class="permalink" href="#query/maxRead"><b>query/maxRead</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When called <i>data</i> is empty. The result of the call is interpreted as
      integer number. This operation is used by the generic layer to determine
      if the transformation establishes a limit on the number of bytes it (the
      generic layer) is allowed read from the transformations lower in the
      stack. A negative result unsets any limit.
    <p class="Pp">This has to be used if a transformation employs some kind of
        end-of-data marker. We cannot allow the generic layer to overshoot this
        marker because any data read after it cannot be stuffed back into the
        core buffers, causing the I/O system to loose data if the transformation
        is unstacked after it recognized the end of its data. This is a
        limitation of the I/O system in the tcl core.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Returning a positive value will cause the I/O system to slow
        down, but also ensures that no data is lost.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Two examples for such transformations are the data
        decompressors for <b>zip</b> and <b>bz2</b>. They use the C-level
        equivalent of this operation to prevent the overshooting.</p>
