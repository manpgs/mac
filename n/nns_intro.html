   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>nns</i> (short for <i>nano nameservice</i>) is a facility built
    for the package <b>comm</b>, adding a simple name service to it. It is also
    built on top of <b>comm</b>, using it for the exchange of messages between
    the client and server parts.</p>
<p class="Pp">This name service facility has nothing to do with the Internet's
    <i>Domain Name System</i>, otherwise known as <i>DNS</i>. If the reader is
    looking for a package dealing with that please see either of the packages
    <b>dns</b> and <b>resolv</b>, both found in Tcllib too.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tcllib provides 2 applications and 4 packages which are working
    together and provide access to the facility at different levels.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="APPLICATIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#APPLICATIONS">APPLICATIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The application <b>nnsd</b> provides a simple name server which
    can be run by anybody anywhere on their system, as they see fit. It is also
    an example on the use of the server-side package
  <b>nameserv::server</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Complementing this server is the <b>nns</b> client application. A
    possible, but no very sensible use would be to enter name/port bindings into
    a server from a shell script. Not sensible, as shell scripts normally do not
    provide a <b>comm</b>-based service.</p>
<p class="Pp">The only case for this to make some sense would be in a shell
    script wrapped around a Tcl script FOO which is using comm, to register the
    listening port used by FOO. However even there it would much more sensible
    to extend FOO to use the nameservice directly. And in regard on how to that
    <b>nns</b> can be used as both example and template. Beyond that it may also
    be useful to perform nameservice queries from shell scripts.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third application, <b>nnslog</b> is a stripped down form of
    the <b>nns</b> client application. It is reduced to perform a continuous
    search for all changes and logs all received events to stdout.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both clients use the <b>nameserv::auto</b> package to
    automatically hande the loss and restoration of the connection to the
    server.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PACKAGES"><a class="permalink" href="#PACKAGES">PACKAGES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The two main packages implementing the service are <b>nameserv</b>
    and <b>nameserv::server</b>, i.e. client and server. The latter has not much
    of an API, just enough to start, stop, and configure it. See the application
    <b>nnsd</b> on how to use it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The basic client, in package <b>nameserv</b>, provides the main
    API to manipulate and query the service. An example of its use is the
    application <b>nns</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second client package, <b>nameserv::auto</b> is API compatible
    to the basic client, but provides the additional functionality that it will
    automatically restore data like bound names when the connection to the name
    service was lost and then reestablished. I.e. it automatically detects the
    loss of the server and re-enters the data when the server comes back.</p>
<p class="Pp">The package <b>nameserv::common</b> is of no interest to users. It
    is an internal package containing code and definitions common to the
    packages <b>nameserv</b> and <b>nameserv::server</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">All packages use the <b>uevent</b> package for the reporting of
    special circumstances via events, and reserve the uevent-tag <i>nameserv</i>
    for their exclusive use. All their events will be posted to that tag.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INTERNALS"><a class="permalink" href="#INTERNALS">INTERNALS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The document <i>Name service facility, client/server protocol</i>
    specifies the protocol used by the packages <b>nameserv</b> and
    <b>nameserv::server</b> to talk to each other. It is of no interest to users
    of either the packages or applications.</p>
<p class="Pp">Developers wishing to modify and/or extend or to just understand
    the internals of the nameservice facility however are strongly advised to
    read it.</p>
