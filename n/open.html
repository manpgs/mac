   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">This command opens a file, serial port, or command pipeline and
    returns a channel identifier that may be used in future invocations of
    commands like <b>read</b>, <b>puts</b>, and <b>close</b>. If the first
    character of <i>fileName</i> is not <b>|</b> then the command opens a file:
    <i>fileName</i> gives the name of the file to open, and it must conform to
    the conventions described in the <b>filename</b> manual entry.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>access</i> argument, if present, indicates the way in which
    the file (or command pipeline) is to be accessed. In the first form
    <i>access</i> may have any of the following values:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="r"><a class="permalink" href="#r"><b>r</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Open the file for reading only; the file must already exist. This is the
      default value if <i>access</i> is not specified.</dd>
  <dt id="r+"><a class="permalink" href="#r+"><b>r+</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Open the file for both reading and writing; the file must already
    exist.</dd>
  <dt id="w"><a class="permalink" href="#w"><b>w</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Open the file for writing only. Truncate it if it exists. If it does not
      exist, create a new file.</dd>
  <dt id="w+"><a class="permalink" href="#w+"><b>w+</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Open the file for reading and writing. Truncate it if it exists. If it
      does not exist, create a new file.</dd>
  <dt id="a"><a class="permalink" href="#a"><b>a</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Open the file for writing only. If the file does not exist, create a new
      empty file. Set the file pointer to the end of the file prior to each
      write.</dd>
  <dt id="a+"><a class="permalink" href="#a+"><b>a+</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Open the file for reading and writing. If the file does not exist, create
      a new empty file. Set the initial access position to the end of the
    file.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">All of the legal <i>access</i> values above may have the character
    <b>b</b> added as the second or third character in the value to indicate
    that the opened channel should be configured with the <b>-translation
    binary</b> option, making the channel suitable for reading or writing of
    binary data.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the second form, <i>access</i> consists of a list of any of the
    following flags, all of which have the standard POSIX meanings. One of the
    flags must be either <b>RDONLY</b>, <b>WRONLY</b> or <b>RDWR</b>.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="RDONLY"><a class="permalink" href="#RDONLY"><b>RDONLY</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Open the file for reading only.</dd>
  <dt id="WRONLY"><a class="permalink" href="#WRONLY"><b>WRONLY</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Open the file for writing only.</dd>
  <dt id="RDWR"><a class="permalink" href="#RDWR"><b>RDWR</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Open the file for both reading and writing.</dd>
  <dt id="APPEND"><a class="permalink" href="#APPEND"><b>APPEND</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Set the file pointer to the end of the file prior to each write.</dd>
  <dt id="BINARY"><a class="permalink" href="#BINARY"><b>BINARY</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Configure the opened channel with the <b>-translation binary</b>
    option.</dd>
  <dt id="CREAT"><a class="permalink" href="#CREAT"><b>CREAT</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Create the file if it does not already exist (without this flag it is an
      error for the file not to exist).</dd>
  <dt id="EXCL"><a class="permalink" href="#EXCL"><b>EXCL</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If <b>CREAT</b> is also specified, an error is returned if the file
      already exists.</dd>
  <dt id="NOCTTY"><a class="permalink" href="#NOCTTY"><b>NOCTTY</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If the file is a terminal device, this flag prevents the file from
      becoming the controlling terminal of the process.</dd>
  <dt id="NONBLOCK"><a class="permalink" href="#NONBLOCK"><b>NONBLOCK</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Prevents the process from blocking while opening the file, and possibly in
      subsequent I/O operations. The exact behavior of this flag is system- and
      device-dependent; its use is discouraged (it is better to use the
      <b>fconfigure</b> command to put a file in nonblocking mode). For details
      refer to your system documentation on the <b>open</b> system call's
      <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> flag.</dd>
  <dt id="TRUNC"><a class="permalink" href="#TRUNC"><b>TRUNC</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If the file exists it is truncated to zero length.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If a new file is created as part of opening it, <i>permissions</i>
    (an integer) is used to set the permissions for the new file in conjunction
    with the process's file mode creation mask. <i>Permissions</i> defaults to
    0666.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMAND_PIPELINES"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMAND_PIPELINES">COMMAND
  PIPELINES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If the first character of <i>fileName</i> is &#x201C;|&#x201D;
    then the remaining characters of <i>fileName</i> are treated as a list of
    arguments that describe a command pipeline to invoke, in the same style as
    the arguments for <b>exec</b>. In this case, the channel identifier returned
    by <b>open</b> may be used to write to the command's input pipe or read from
    its output pipe, depending on the value of <i>access</i>. If write-only
    access is used (e.g. <i>access</i> is <b>w</b>), then standard output for
    the pipeline is directed to the current standard output unless overridden by
    the command. If read-only access is used (e.g. <i>access</i> is <b>r</b>),
    standard input for the pipeline is taken from the current standard input
    unless overridden by the command. The id of the spawned process is
    accessible through the <b>pid</b> command, using the channel id returned by
    <b>open</b> as argument.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the command (or one of the commands) executed in the command
    pipeline returns an error (according to the definition in <b>exec</b>), a
    Tcl error is generated when <b>close</b> is called on the channel unless the
    pipeline is in non-blocking mode then no exit status is returned (a silent
    <b>close</b> with -blocking 0).</p>
<p class="Pp">It is often useful to use the <b>fileevent</b> command with
    pipelines so other processing may happen at the same time as running the
    command in the background.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SERIAL_COMMUNICATIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#SERIAL_COMMUNICATIONS">SERIAL
  COMMUNICATIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If <i>fileName</i> refers to a serial port, then the specified
    serial port is opened and initialized in a platform-dependent manner.
    Acceptable values for the <i>fileName</i> to use to open a serial port are
    described in the PORTABILITY ISSUES section.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>fconfigure</b> command can be used to query and set
    additional configuration options specific to serial ports (where
  supported):</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="mode"><a class="permalink" href="#mode"><b>-mode</b>
    <i>baud</i><b>,</b><i>parity</i><b>,</b><i>data</i><b>,</b><i>stop</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This option is a set of 4 comma-separated values: the baud rate, parity,
      number of data bits, and number of stop bits for this serial port. The
      <i>baud</i> rate is a simple integer that specifies the connection speed.
      <i>Parity</i> is one of the following letters: <b>n</b>, <b>o</b>,
      <b>e</b>, <b>m</b>, <b>s</b>; respectively signifying the parity options
      of &#x201C;none&#x201D;, &#x201C;odd&#x201D;, &#x201C;even&#x201D;,
      &#x201C;mark&#x201D;, or &#x201C;space&#x201D;. <i>Data</i> is the number
      of data bits and should be an integer from 5 to 8, while <i>stop</i> is
      the number of stop bits and should be the integer 1 or 2.</dd>
  <dt id="handshake"><a class="permalink" href="#handshake"><b>-handshake</b>
    <i>type</i></a></dt>
  <dd>(Windows and Unix). This option is used to setup automatic handshake
      control. Note that not all handshake types maybe supported by your
      operating system. The <i>type</i> parameter is case-independent.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If <i>type</i> is <b>none</b> then any handshake is switched off.
    <b>rtscts</b> activates hardware handshake. Hardware handshake signals are
    described below. For software handshake <b>xonxoff</b> the handshake
    characters can be redefined with <b>-xchar</b>. An additional hardware
    handshake <b>dtrdsr</b> is available only under Windows. There is no default
    handshake configuration, the initial value depends on your operating system
    settings. The <b>-handshake</b> option cannot be queried.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="queue"><a class="permalink" href="#queue"><b>-queue</b></a></dt>
  <dd>(Windows and Unix). The <b>-queue</b> option can only be queried. It
      returns a list of two integers representing the current number of bytes in
      the input and output queue respectively.</dd>
  <dt id="timeout"><a class="permalink" href="#timeout"><b>-timeout</b>
    <i>msec</i></a></dt>
  <dd>(Windows and Unix). This option is used to set the timeout for blocking
      read operations. It specifies the maximum interval between the reception
      of two bytes in milliseconds. For Unix systems the granularity is 100
      milliseconds. The <b>-timeout</b> option does not affect write operations
      or nonblocking reads. This option cannot be queried.</dd>
  <dt id="ttycontrol"><a class="permalink" href="#ttycontrol"><b>-ttycontrol</b>
    <i>{signal boolean signal boolean ...}</i></a></dt>
  <dd>(Windows and Unix). This option is used to setup the handshake output
      lines (see below) permanently or to send a BREAK over the serial line. The
      <i>signal</i> names are case-independent. <b>{RTS 1 DTR 0}</b> sets the
      RTS output to high and the DTR output to low. The BREAK condition (see
      below) is enabled and disabled with <b>{BREAK 1}</b> and <b>{BREAK 0}</b>
      respectively. It is not a good idea to change the <b>RTS</b> (or
      <b>DTR</b>) signal with active hardware handshake <b>rtscts</b> (or
      <b>dtrdsr</b>). The result is unpredictable. The <b>-ttycontrol</b> option
      cannot be queried.</dd>
  <dt id="ttystatus"><a class="permalink" href="#ttystatus"><b>-ttystatus</b></a></dt>
  <dd>(Windows and Unix). The <b>-ttystatus</b> option can only be queried. It
      returns the current modem status and handshake input signals (see below).
      The result is a list of signal,value pairs with a fixed order, e.g.
      <b>{CTS 1 DSR 0 RING 1 DCD 0}</b>. The <i>signal</i> names are returned
      upper case.</dd>
  <dt id="xchar"><a class="permalink" href="#xchar"><b>-xchar</b> <i>{xonChar
    xoffChar}</i></a></dt>
  <dd>(Windows and Unix). This option is used to query or change the software
      handshake characters. Normally the operating system default should be DC1
      (0x11) and DC3 (0x13) representing the ASCII standard XON and XOFF
      characters.</dd>
  <dt id="pollinterval"><a class="permalink" href="#pollinterval"><b>-pollinterval</b>
    <i>msec</i></a></dt>
  <dd>(Windows only). This option is used to set the maximum time between
      polling for fileevents. This affects the time interval between checking
      for events throughout the Tcl interpreter (the smallest value always
      wins). Use this option only if you want to poll the serial port more or
      less often than 10 msec (the default).</dd>
  <dt id="sysbuffer"><a class="permalink" href="#sysbuffer"><b>-sysbuffer</b>
    <i>inSize</i></a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="sysbuffer~2"><a class="permalink" href="#sysbuffer~2"><b>-sysbuffer</b>
    <i>{inSize outSize}</i></a></dt>
  <dd>(Windows only). This option is used to change the size of Windows system
      buffers for a serial channel. Especially at higher communication rates the
      default input buffer size of 4096 bytes can overrun for latent systems.
      The first form specifies the input buffer size, in the second form both
      input and output buffers are defined.</dd>
  <dt id="lasterror"><a class="permalink" href="#lasterror"><b>-lasterror</b></a></dt>
  <dd>(Windows only). This option is query only. In case of a serial
      communication error, <b>read</b> or <b>puts</b> returns a general Tcl file
      I/O error. <b>fconfigure -lasterror</b> can be called to get a list of
      error details. See below for an explanation of the various error
    codes.</dd>

    is opened for reading from a 16-bit DOS application, the call to <b>open</b>
    will not return until end-of-file has been received from the command
    pipeline's standard output. If a command pipeline is opened for writing to a
    16-bit DOS application, no data will be sent to the command pipeline's
    standard output until the pipe is actually closed. This problem occurs
    because 16-bit DOS applications are run synchronously, as described
  above.</p>

  <dd>Valid values for <i>fileName</i> to open a serial port are generally of
      the form <b>/dev/tty</b><i>X</i>, where <i>X</i> is <b>a</b> or <b>b</b>,
      but the name of any pseudo-file that maps to a serial port may be used.
      Advanced configuration options are only supported for serial ports when
      Tcl is built to use the POSIX serial interface.</dd>

<p class="Pp">When running Tcl interactively, there may be some strange
    interactions between the console, if one is present, and a command pipeline
    that uses standard input. If a command pipeline is opened for reading, some
    of the lines entered at the console will be sent to the command pipeline and
    some will be sent to the Tcl evaluator. This problem only occurs because
    both Tcl and the child application are competing for the console at the same
    time. If the command pipeline is started from a script, so that Tcl is not
    accessing the console, or if the command pipeline does not use standard
    input, but is redirected from a file, then the above problem does not
  occur.</p>
