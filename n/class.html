   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">The fundamental construct in <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> is the class
    definition. Each class acts as a template for actual objects that can be
    created. The class itself is a namespace which contains things common to all
    objects. Each object has its own unique bundle of data which contains
    instances of the &quot;variables&quot; defined in the class definition. Each
    object also has a built-in variable named &quot;this&quot;, which contains
    the name of the object. Classes can also have &quot;common&quot; data
    members that are shared by all objects in a class.</p>
<p class="Pp">Two types of functions can be included in the class definition.
    &quot;Methods&quot; are functions which operate on a specific object, and
    therefore have access to both &quot;variables&quot; and &quot;common&quot;
    data members. &quot;Procs&quot; are ordinary procedures in the class
    namespace, and only have access to &quot;common&quot; data members.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the body of any method or proc starts with
    &quot;<b>@</b>&quot;, it is treated as the symbolic name for a C procedure.
    Otherwise, it is treated as a Tcl code script. See below for details on
    registering and using C procedures.</p>
<p class="Pp">A class can only be defined once, although the bodies of class
    methods and procs can be defined again and again for interactive debugging.
    See the <b>body</b> and <b>configbody</b> commands for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each namespace can have its own collection of objects and classes.
    The list of classes available in the current context can be queried using
    the &quot;<b>itcl::find classes</b>&quot; command, and the list of objects,
    with the &quot;<b>itcl::find objects</b>&quot; command.</p>
<p class="Pp">A class can be deleted using the &quot;<b>delete class</b>&quot;
    command. Individual objects can be deleted using the &quot;<b>delete
    object</b>&quot; command.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CLASS_DEFINITIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#CLASS_DEFINITIONS">CLASS
  DEFINITIONS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="class"><a class="permalink" href="#class"><b>class </b><i>className
    definition</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Provides the definition for a class named <i>className</i>. If the class
      <i>className</i> already exists, or if a command called <i>className</i>
      exists in the current namespace context, this command returns an error. If
      the class definition is successfully parsed, <i>className</i> becomes a
      command in the current context, handling the creation of objects for this
      class.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The class <i>definition</i> is evaluated as a series of Tcl
    statements that define elements within the class. The following class
    definition commands are recognized:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="inherit"><a class="permalink" href="#inherit"><b>inherit
    </b><i>baseClass</i> ?<i>baseClass</i>...?</a></dt>
  <dd>Causes the current class to inherit characteristics from one or more base
      classes. Classes must have been defined by a previous <b>class</b>
      command, or must be available to the auto-loading facility (see
      &quot;AUTO-LOADING&quot; below). A single class definition can contain no
      more than one <b>inherit</b> command.
    <p class="Pp">The order of <i>baseClass</i> names in the <b>inherit</b> list
        affects the name resolution for class members. When the same member name
        appears in two or more base classes, the base class that appears first
        in the <b>inherit</b> list takes precedence. For example, if classes
        &quot;Foo&quot; and &quot;Bar&quot; both contain the member
        &quot;x&quot;, and if another class has the &quot;<b>inherit</b>&quot;
        statement:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
inherit Foo Bar
</pre>
</div>
then the name &quot;x&quot; means &quot;Foo::x&quot;. Other inherited members
  named &quot;x&quot; must be referenced with their explicit name, like
  &quot;Bar::x&quot;.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="constructor"><a class="permalink" href="#constructor"><b>constructor
    </b><i>args</i> ?<i>init</i>? <i>body</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Declares the <i>args</i> argument list and <i>body</i> used for the
      constructor, which is automatically invoked whenever an object is created.
    <p class="Pp">Before the <i>body</i> is executed, the optional <i>init</i>
        statement is used to invoke any base class constructors that require
        arguments. Variables in the <i>args</i> specification can be accessed in
        the <i>init</i> code fragment, and passed to base class constructors.
        After evaluating the <i>init</i> statement, any base class constructors
        that have not been executed are invoked automatically without arguments.
        This ensures that all base classes are fully constructed before the
        constructor <i>body</i> is executed. By default, this scheme causes
        constructors to be invoked in order from least- to most-specific. This
        is exactly the opposite of the order that classes are reported by the
        <b>info heritage</b> command.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If construction is successful, the constructor always returns
        the object name-regardless of how the <i>body</i> is defined-and the
        object name becomes a command in the current namespace context. If
        construction fails, an error message is returned.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="destructor"><a class="permalink" href="#destructor"><b>destructor
    </b><i>body</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Declares the <i>body</i> used for the destructor, which is automatically
      invoked when an object is deleted. If the destructor is successful, the
      object data is destroyed and the object name is removed as a command from
      the interpreter. If destruction fails, an error message is returned and
      the object remains.
    <p class="Pp">When an object is destroyed, all destructors in its class
        hierarchy are invoked in order from most- to least-specific. This is the
        order that the classes are reported by the &quot;<b>info
        heritage</b>&quot; command, and it is exactly the opposite of the
        default constructor order.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="method"><a class="permalink" href="#method"><b>method </b><i>name</i>
    ?<i>args</i>? ?<i>body</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Declares a method called <i>name</i>. When the method <i>body</i> is
      executed, it will have automatic access to object-specific variables and
      common data members.
    <p class="Pp">If the <i>args</i> list is specified, it establishes the usage
        information for this method. The <b>body</b> command can be used to
        redefine the method body, but the <i>args</i> list must match this
        specification.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Within the body of another class method, a method can be
        invoked like any other command-simply by using its name. Outside of the
        class context, the method name must be prefaced an object name, which
        provides the context for the data that it manipulates. Methods in a base
        class that are redefined in the current class, or hidden by another base
        class, can be qualified using the
        &quot;<i>className</i>::<i>method</i>&quot; syntax.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="proc"><a class="permalink" href="#proc"><b>proc </b><i>name</i>
    ?<i>args</i>? ?<i>body</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Declares a proc called <i>name</i>. A proc is an ordinary procedure within
      the class namespace. Unlike a method, a proc is invoked without referring
      to a specific object. When the proc <i>body</i> is executed, it will have
      automatic access only to common data members.
    <p class="Pp">If the <i>args</i> list is specified, it establishes the usage
        information for this proc. The <b>body</b> command can be used to
        redefine the proc body, but the <i>args</i> list must match this
        specification.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Within the body of another class method or proc, a proc can be
        invoked like any other command-simply by using its name. In any other
        namespace context, the proc is invoked using a qualified name like
        &quot;<i>className</i><b>::</b><i>proc</i>&quot;. Procs in a base class
        that are redefined in the current class, or hidden by another base
        class, can also be accessed via their qualified name.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="variable"><a class="permalink" href="#variable"><b>variable
    </b><i>varName</i> ?<i>init</i>? ?<i>config</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Defines an object-specific variable named <i>varName</i>. All
      object-specific variables are automatically available in class methods.
      They need not be declared with anything like the <b>global</b> command.
    <p class="Pp">If the optional <i>init</i> string is specified, it is used as
        the initial value of the variable when a new object is created.
        Initialization forces the variable to be a simple scalar value;
        uninitialized variables, on the other hand, can be set within the
        constructor and used as arrays.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The optional <i>config</i> script is only allowed for public
        variables. If specified, this code fragment is executed whenever a
        public variable is modified by the built-in &quot;configure&quot;
        method. The <i>config</i> script can also be specified outside of the
        class definition using the <b>configbody</b> command.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="common"><a class="permalink" href="#common"><b>common
    </b><i>varName</i> ?<i>init</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Declares a common variable named <i>varName</i>. Common variables reside
      in the class namespace and are shared by all objects belonging to the
      class. They are just like global variables, except that they need not be
      declared with the usual <b>global</b> command. They are automatically
      visible in all class methods and procs.
    <p class="Pp">If the optional <i>init</i> string is specified, it is used as
        the initial value of the variable. Initialization forces the variable to
        be a simple scalar value; uninitialized variables, on the other hand,
        can be set with subsequent <b>set</b> and <b>array</b> commands and used
        as arrays.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Once a common data member has been defined, it can be set
        using <b>set</b> and <b>array</b> commands within the class definition.
        This allows common data members to be initialized as arrays. For
        example:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
itcl::class Foo {
<br/>
    common boolean
<br/>
    set boolean(true) 1
<br/>
    set boolean(false) 0
}
</pre>
</div>
Note that if common data members are initialized within the constructor, they
  get initialized again and again whenever new objects are created.

  <dt id="private"><a class="permalink" href="#private"><b>private
    </b><i>command</i> ?<i>arg arg ...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>These commands are used to set the protection level for class members that
      are created when <i>command</i> is evaluated. The <i>command</i> is
      usually <b>method</b>, <b>proc</b>, <b>variable</b> or<b>common</b>, and
      the remaining <i>arg</i>'s complete the member definition. However,
      <i>command</i> can also be a script containing many different member
      definitions, and the protection level will apply to all of the members
      that are created.

<p class="Pp">Once a class has been defined, the class name can be used as a
    command to create new objects belonging to the class.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="className"><a class="permalink" href="#className"><i>className
    objName</i> ?<i>args...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Creates a new object in class <i>className</i> with the name
      <i>objName</i>. Remaining arguments are passed to the constructor of the
      most-specific class. This in turn passes arguments to base class
      constructors before invoking its own body of commands. If construction is
      successful, a command called <i>objName</i> is created in the current
      namespace context, and <i>objName</i> is returned as the result of this
      operation. If an error is encountered during construction, the destructors
      are automatically invoked to free any resources that have been allocated,
      the object is deleted, and an error is returned.
    <p class="Pp">If <i>objName</i> contains the string
        &quot;<b>#auto</b>&quot;, that string is replaced with an automatically
        generated name. Names have the form <i>className&lt;number&gt;</i>,
        where the <i>className</i> part is modified to start with a lowercase
        letter. In class &quot;Toaster&quot;, for example, the
        &quot;<b>#auto</b>&quot; specification would produce names like
        toaster0, toaster1, etc. Note that &quot;<b>#auto</b>&quot; can be also
        be buried within an object name:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">

<br/>
        set crumbs 0
<br/>
    }
}
</pre>
</div>
We might create another class like SmartToaster that redefines the
  &quot;toast&quot; method. If we want to access the base class method, we can
  qualify it with the base class name, to avoid ambiguity:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
itcl::class SmartToaster {
<br/>
    inherit Toaster
<br/>
    method toast {nslices} {
<br/>
        if {$crumbs &gt; 40} {
<br/>
            clean
<br/>
        }
<br/>
        return [Toaster::toast $nslices]
<br/>
    }
}
</pre>
</div>
Instead of hard-coding the base class name, we can use the &quot;chain&quot;
  command like this:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
itcl::class SmartToaster {
<br/>
    inherit Toaster
<br/>
    method toast {nslices} {
<br/>
        if {$crumbs &gt; 40} {
<br/>
            clean
<br/>
        }
<br/>
        return [chain $nslices]
<br/>
    }
}
</pre>
</div>
The chain command searches through the class hierarchy for a slightly more
  generic (base class) implementation of a method or proc, and invokes it with
  the specified arguments. It starts at the current class context and searches
  through base classes in the order that they are reported by the &quot;info
  heritage&quot; command. If another implementation is not found, this command
  does nothing and returns the null string.

<h1 class="Sh" id="AUTO-LOADING"><a class="permalink" href="#AUTO-LOADING">AUTO-LOADING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Class definitions need not be loaded explicitly; they can be
    loaded as needed by the usual Tcl auto-loading facility. Each directory
    containing class definition files should have an accompanying
    &quot;tclIndex&quot; file. Each line in this file identifies a Tcl procedure
    or <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> class definition and the file where the
    definition can be found.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, suppose a directory contains the definitions for
    classes &quot;Toaster&quot; and &quot;SmartToaster&quot;. Then the
    &quot;tclIndex&quot; file for this directory would look like:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
# Tcl autoload index file, version 2.0 for [incr Tcl]
# This file is generated by the &quot;auto_mkindex&quot; command
# and sourced to set up indexing information for one or
# more commands.  Typically each line is a command that
# sets an element in the auto_index array, where the
# element name is the name of a command and the value is
# a script that loads the command.
set auto_index(::Toaster) &quot;source $dir/Toaster.itcl&quot;
set auto_index(::SmartToaster) &quot;source $dir/SmartToaster.itcl&quot;
</pre>
<pre>
The <b>auto_mkindex</b> command is used to automatically
generate &quot;tclIndex&quot; files.
</pre>
</div>
The auto-loader must be made aware of this directory by appending the directory
  name to the &quot;auto_path&quot; variable. When this is in place, classes
  will be auto-loaded as needed when used in an application.

<h1 class="Sh" id="C_PROCEDURES"><a class="permalink" href="#C_PROCEDURES">C
  PROCEDURES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">C procedures can be integrated into an <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b>
    class definition to implement methods, procs, and the &quot;config&quot;
    code for public variables. Any body that starts with &quot;<b>@</b>&quot; is
    treated as the symbolic name for a C procedure.</p>
<p class="Pp">Symbolic names are established by registering procedures via
    <b>Itcl_RegisterC()</b>. This is usually done in the <b>Tcl_AppInit()</b>
    procedure, which is automatically called when the interpreter starts up. In
    the following example, the procedure My_FooCmd() is registered with the
    symbolic name &quot;foo&quot;. This procedure can be referenced in the
    <b>body</b> command as &quot;@foo&quot;.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
int
Tcl_AppInit(interp)
<br/>
    Tcl_Interp *interp;     /* Interpreter for application. */
{
<br/>
    if (Itcl_Init(interp) == TCL_ERROR) {
<br/>
        return TCL_ERROR;
<br/>
    }
<br/>
    if (Itcl_RegisterC(interp, &quot;foo&quot;, My_FooCmd) != TCL_OK) {
<br/>
        return TCL_ERROR;
<br/>
    }
}
</pre>
</div>
C procedures are implemented just like ordinary Tcl commands. See the
  <b>CrtCommand</b> man page for details. Within the procedure, class data
  members can be accessed like ordinary variables using <b>Tcl_SetVar()</b>,
  <b>Tcl_GetVar()</b>, <b>Tcl_TraceVar()</b>, etc. Class methods and procs can
  be executed like ordinary commands using <b>Tcl_Eval()</b>.
  <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> makes this possible by automatically setting up the
  context before executing the C procedure.
<p class="Pp">This scheme provides a natural migration path for code
    development. Classes can be developed quickly using Tcl code to implement
    the bodies. An entire application can be built and tested. When necessary,
    individual bodies can be implemented with C code to improve performance.</p>
