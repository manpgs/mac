   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">The packages <b>nameserv::server</b>, <b>nameserv</b>, and
    <b>nameserv::common</b> provide a simple unprotected name service facility
    for use in small trusted environments.</p>
<p class="Pp">Please read <i>Name service facility, introduction</i> first.</p>
<p class="Pp">This document contains the specification of the network protocol
    which is used by client and server to talk to each other, enabling
    implementations of the same protocol in other languages.</p>

  NAME SERVICE PROTOCOL VERSION 1</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This protocol defines the basic set of messages to be supported by
    a name service, also called the <i>Core</i> feature.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="BASIC_LAYER"><a class="permalink" href="#BASIC_LAYER">BASIC
  LAYER</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The basic communication between client and server is done using
    the remote-execution protocol specified by the Tcl package <b>comm</b>. The
    relevant document specifying its on-the-wire protocol can be found in
    <i>comm_wire</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">All the scripts exchanged via this protocol are single commands in
    list form and thus can be interpreted as plain messages instead of as Tcl
    commands. The commands/messages specified in the next section are the only
    commands understood by the server-side. Command and variable substitutions
    are not allowed within the messages, i.e. arguments have to be literal
    values.</p>
<p class="Pp">The protocol is synchronous. I.e. for each message sent a response
    is expected, and has to be generated. All messages are sent by the client.
    The server does not sent messages, only responses to messages.</p>

  <dd>The client sends this message when it registers itself at the service with

  NAME SERVICE PROTOCOL EXTENSION: CONTINUOUS SEARCH</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This protocol defines an extended set of messages to be supported
    by a name service, also called the <i>Search/Continuous</i> feature. This
    feature defines additional messages between client and server, and is
    otherwise identical to version 1 of the protocol. See the last section for
    the details of our foundation.</p>
<p class="Pp">A service supporting this feature has to put the feature name
    <b>Search/Continuous</b> into the list of features returned by the message
    <i>ProtocolFeatures</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For this extension the protocol is asynchronous. No direct
    response is expected for any of the messages in the extension. Furthermore
    the server will start sending messages on its own, instead of only responses
    to messages, and the client has to be able to handle these
  notifications.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Search/Continuous/Start"><a class="permalink" href="#Search/Continuous/Start"><b>Search/Continuous/Start</b>
    <i>tag</i> <i>pattern</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The client sends this message to start searching the service for names
      matching the glob-<i>pattern</i>. In contrast to the regular <i>Search</i>
      request this one asks the server to continuously monitor the database for
      the addition and removal of matching entries and to notify the client of
      all such changes. The particular search is identified by the <i>tag</i>.
    <p class="Pp">No direct response is expected, rather the clients expect to
        be notified of changes via explicit <i>Search/Continuous/Result</i>
        messages generated by the service.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is further expected that the <i>tag</i> information is
        passed unchanged to the <i>Search/Continuous/Result</i> messages. This
        tagging of the results enables clients to start multiple searches and
        distinguish between the different results.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Search/Continuous/Stop"><a class="permalink" href="#Search/Continuous/Stop"><b>Search/Continuous/Stop</b>
    <i>tag</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The client sends this message to stop the continuous search identified by
      the <i>tag</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="Search/Continuous/Change"><a class="permalink" href="#Search/Continuous/Change"><b>Search/Continuous/Change</b>
    <i>tag</i> <b>add</b>|<b>remove</b> <i>response</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This message is sent by the service to clients with active continuous
      searches to transfer found changes. The first such message for a new
      continuous search has to contains the current set of matching entries.
    <p class="Pp">To ensure this a service has to generate an <b>add</b>-message
        with an empty <i>response</i> if there were no matching entries at the
        time.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <i>response</i> has to be a dictionary containing the
        matching names as keys, and mapping them to the data associated with it
        at <b>Bind</b>-time. The argument coming before the response tells the
        client whether the names in the response were added or removed from the
        service.</p>
