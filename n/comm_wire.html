   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">The <b>comm</b> command provides an inter-interpreter remote
    execution facility much like Tk's <b>send(n)</b>, except that it uses
    sockets rather than the X server for the communication path. As a result,
    <b>comm</b> works with multiple interpreters, works on Windows and Macintosh
    systems, and provides control over the remote execution path.</p>
<p class="Pp">This document contains a specification of the various versions of
    the wire protocol used by comm internally for the communication between its
    endpoints. It has no relevance to users of <b>comm</b>, only to developers
    who wish to modify the package, write a compatible facility in a different
    language, or some other facility based on the same protocol.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="BASIC_LAYER"><a class="permalink" href="#BASIC_LAYER">BASIC
  LAYER</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The basic encoding for <i>all</i> data is UTF-8. Because of this
    binary data, including the NULL character, can be sent over the wire as is,
    without the need for armoring it.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="BASIC_MESSAGE_LAYER"><a class="permalink" href="#BASIC_MESSAGE_LAYER">BASIC
  MESSAGE LAYER</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">On top of the <b>Basic Layer</b> we have a <i>message oriented</i>
    exchange of data. The totality of all characters written to the channel is a
    Tcl list, with each element a separate <i>message</i>, each itself a list.
    The messages in the overall list are separated by EOL. Note that EOL
    characters can occur within the list as well. They can be distinguished from
    the message-separating EOL by the fact that the data from the beginning up
    to their location is not a valid Tcl list.</p>
<p class="Pp">EOL is signaled through the linefeed character, i.e <b>LF</b>, or,
    hex <b>0x0a</b>. This is following the unix convention for line-endings.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a list each message is composed of <i>words</i>. Their meaning
    depends on when the message was sent in the overall exchange. This is
    described in the upcoming sections.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="NEGOTIATION_MESSAGES_-_INITIAL_HANDSHAKE"><a class="permalink" href="#NEGOTIATION_MESSAGES_-_INITIAL_HANDSHAKE">NEGOTIATION
  MESSAGES - INITIAL HANDSHAKE</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The command protocol is defined like this:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The first message send by a client to a server, when opening the
      connection, contains two words. The first word is a list as well, and
      contains the versions of the wire protocol the client is willing to
      accept, with the most preferred version first. The second word is the TCP
      port the client is listening on for connections to itself. The value
      <b>0</b> is used here to signal that the client will not listen for
      connections, i.e. that it is purely for sending commands, and not
      receiving them.</li>
  <li>The first message sent by the server to the client, in response to the
      message above contains only one word. This word is a list, containing the
      string <b>vers</b> as its first element, and the version of the wire
      protocol the server has selected from the offered versions as the
    second.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="SCRIPT/COMMAND_MESSAGES"><a class="permalink" href="#SCRIPT/COMMAND_MESSAGES">SCRIPT/COMMAND
  MESSAGES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">All messages coming after the <b>initial handshake</b> consist of
    three words. These are an instruction, a transaction id, and the payload.
    The valid instructions are shown below. The transaction ids are used by the
    client to match any incoming replies to the command messages it sent. This
    means that a server has to copy the transaction id from a command message to
    the reply it sends for that message.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="send"><a class="permalink" href="#send"><b>send</b></a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="async"><a class="permalink" href="#async"><b>async</b></a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="command"><a class="permalink" href="#command"><b>command</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The payload is the Tcl script to execute on the server. It is actually a
      list containing the script fragments. These fragment are
      <b>concat</b>enated together by the server to form the full script to
      execute on the server side. This emulates the Tcl &quot;eval&quot;
      semantics. In most cases it is best to have only one word in the list, a
      list containing the exact command.
    <p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
<br/>
    (a)     {send 1 {{array get tcl_platform}}}
<br/>
    (b)     {send 1 {array get tcl_platform}}
<br/>
    (c)     {send 1 {array {get tcl_platform}}}
<br/>
    are all valid representations of the same command. They are
<br/>
    generated via
<br/>
    (a')    send {array get tcl_platform}
<br/>
    (b')    send array get tcl_platform
<br/>
    (c')    send array {get tcl_platform}
<br/>
    respectively
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that (a), generated by (a'), is the usual form, if only
        single commands are sent by the client. For example constructed using
        <b>list</b>, if the command contains variable arguments. Like</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
<br/>
    send [list array get $the_variable]
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">These three instructions all invoke the script on the server
        side. Their difference is in the treatment of result values, and thus
        determines if a reply is expected.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="send~2"><a class="permalink" href="#send~2"><b>send</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A reply is expected. The sender is waiting for the result.</dd>
  <dt id="async~2"><a class="permalink" href="#async~2"><b>async</b></a></dt>
  <dd>No reply is expected, the sender has no interest in the result and is not
      waiting for any.</dd>
  <dt id="command~2"><a class="permalink" href="#command~2"><b>command</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A reply is expected, but the sender is not waiting for it. It has arranged
      to get a process-internal notification when the result arrives.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="reply"><a class="permalink" href="#reply"><b>reply</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Like the previous three command, however the tcl script in the payload is
      highly restricted. It has to be a syntactically valid Tcl <b>return</b>
      command. This contains result code, value, error code, and error info.
    <p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
<br/>
    {reply 1 {return -code 0 {}}}
<br/>
    {reply 1 {return -code 0 {osVersion 2.4.21-99-default byteOrder littleEndian machine i686 platform unix os Linux user andreask wordSize 4}}}
