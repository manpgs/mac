   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   SCCS: @(#) man.macros 1.9 97/08/22 18:50:59
  
  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.

<p class="Pp">Mega-widgets are high-level widgets that are constructed using Tk
    widgets as component parts, usually without any C code. A fileselectionbox,
    for example, may have a few listboxes, some entry widgets and some control
    buttons. These individual widgets are put together in a way that makes them
    act like one big widget. A fileselectionbox mega-widget can be created with
    a command like:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
fileselectionbox .fsb -background blue -foreground white</pre>
</div>
Once it has been created, it can be reconfigured with a command like:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
.fsb configure -background green -foreground black</pre>
</div>
and all of its internal components will change color. Each mega-widget has a set
  of methods that can be used to manipulate it. For example, the current
  selection can be queried from a fileselectionbox like this:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
set fileName [.fsb get]</pre>
</div>
In effect, a mega-widget looks and acts exactly like a Tk widget, but is
  considerably easier to implement.
<p class="Pp"><b>[incr&#x00A0;Tk]</b> is a framework for building mega-widgets.
    It uses <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> to support the object paradigm, and adds
    base classes which provide default widget behaviors.</p>
<p class="Pp">All <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tk]</b> widgets are derived from the
    <b>Archetype</b> base class. This class manages internal component widgets,
    and provides methods like &quot;configure&quot; and &quot;cget&quot; to
    access configuration options.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>Widget</b> base class inherits everything from
    <b>Archetype</b>, and adds a Tk frame which acts as a container for the
    mega-widget. It is used to build mega-widgets that sit inside of other
    frames and toplevels. Derived classes create other internal components and
    pack them into the &quot;hull&quot; frame created by the <b>Widget</b> base
    class.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>Toplevel</b> base class inherits everything from
    <b>Archetype</b>, but adds a Tk toplevel which acts as a container for the
    mega-widget. It is used to build mega-widgets, such as dialog boxes, that
    have their own toplevel window. Derived classes create other internal
    components and pack them into the &quot;hull&quot; toplevel created by the
    <b>Toplevel</b> base class.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>[incr&#x00A0;Widgets]</b> is a mega-widget library built using
    <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tk]</b>. It can be used right out of the box, and contains
    more than 30 different widget classes, including:</p>

<p class="Pp">The <b>catalog</b> demo in the &quot;iwidgets/demos&quot;
