   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">The <b>tkwait</b> command waits for one of several things to
    happen, then it returns without taking any other actions. The return value
    is always an empty string. If the first argument is <b>variable</b> (or any
    abbreviation of it) then the second argument is the name of a global
    variable and the command waits for that variable to be modified. If the
    first argument is <b>visibility</b> (or any abbreviation of it) then the
    second argument is the name of a window and the <b>tkwait</b> command waits
    for a change in its visibility state (as indicated by the arrival of a
    VisibilityNotify event). This form is typically used to wait for a
    newly-created window to appear on the screen before taking some action. If
    the first argument is <b>window</b> (or any abbreviation of it) then the
    second argument is the name of a window and the <b>tkwait</b> command waits
    for that window to be destroyed. This form is typically used to wait for a
    user to finish interacting with a dialog box before using the result of that
    interaction.</p>
<p class="Pp">While the <b>tkwait</b> command is waiting it processes events in
    the normal fashion, so the application will continue to respond to user
    interactions. If an event handler invokes <b>tkwait</b> again, the nested
    call to <b>tkwait</b> must complete before the outer call can complete.</p>
