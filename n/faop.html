   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">This package provides a number of complex operations on finite
    automatons (Short: FA), as provided by the package <b>grammar::fa</b>. The
    package does not provide the ability to create and/or manipulate such FAs,
    nor the ability to execute a FA for a stream of symbols. Use the packages
    <b>grammar::fa</b> and <b>grammar::fa::interpreter</b> for that. Another
    package related to this is <b>grammar::fa::compiler</b> which turns a FA
    into an executor class which has the definition of the FA hardwired into
  it.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more information about what a finite automaton is see section
    <i>FINITE AUTOMATONS</i> in package <b>grammar::fa</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="API"><a class="permalink" href="#API">API</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The package exports the API described here. All commands modify
    their first argument. I.e. whatever FA they compute is stored back into it.
    Some of the operations will construct an automaton whose states are all new,
    but related to the states in the source automaton(s). These operations take
    variable names as optional arguments where they will store mappings which
    describe the relationship(s). The operations can be loosely partitioned into
    structural and language operations. The latter are defined in terms of the
    language the automaton(s) accept, whereas the former are defined in terms of
    the structural properties of the involved automaton(s). Some operations are
    both. <i>Structure operations</i></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>::grammar::fa::op::constructor</b> <i>cmd</i></dt>
  <dd>This command has to be called by the user of the package before any other
      operations is performed, to establish a command which can be used to
      construct a FA container object. If this is not done several operations
      will fail as they are unable to construct internal and transient
      containers to hold state and/or partial results.
    <p class="Pp">Any container class using this package for complex operations
        should set its own class command as the constructor. See package
        <b>grammar::fa</b> for an example.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>::grammar::fa::op::reverse</b> <i>fa</i></dt>
  <dd>Reverses the <i>fa</i>. This is done by reversing the direction of all
      transitions and swapping the sets of <i>start</i> and <i>final</i> states.
      The language of <i>fa</i> changes unpredictably.</dd>
  <dt><b>::grammar::fa::op::complete</b> <i>fa</i> ?<i>sink</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Completes the <i>fa</i> <i>complete</i>, but nothing is done if the
      <i>fa</i> is already <i>complete</i>. This implies that only the first in
      a series of multiple consecutive complete operations on <i>fa</i> will
      perform anything. The remainder will be null operations.
    <p class="Pp">The language of <i>fa</i> is unchanged by this operation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is done by adding a single new state, the <i>sink</i>,
        and transitions from all other states to that sink for all symbols they
        have no transitions for. The sink itself is made complete by adding loop
        transitions for all symbols.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note: When a FA has epsilon-transitions transitions over a
        symbol for a state S can be indirect, i.e. not attached directly to S,
        but to a state in the epsilon-closure of S. The symbols for such
        indirect transitions count when computing completeness of a state. In
        other words, these indirectly reached symbols are <i>not</i>
      missing.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The argument <i>sink</i> provides the name for the new state
        and most not be present in the <i>fa</i> if specified. If the name is
        not specified the command will name the state &quot;sink<b>n</b>&quot;,
        where <b>n</b> is set so that there are no collisions with existing
        states.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the sink state is <i>not useful</i> by definition.
        In other words, while the FA becomes complete, it is also <i>not
        useful</i> in the strict sense as it has a state from which no final
        state can be reached.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>::grammar::fa::op::remove_eps</b> <i>fa</i></dt>
  <dd>Removes all epsilon-transitions from the <i>fa</i> in such a manner the
      the language of <i>fa</i> is unchanged. However nothing is done if the
      <i>fa</i> is already <i>epsilon-free</i>. This implies that only the first
      in a series of multiple consecutive complete operations on <i>fa</i> will
      perform anything. The remainder will be null operations.
    <p class="Pp"><i>Note:</i> This operation may cause states to become
        unreachable or not useful. These states are not removed by this
        operation. Use <b>::grammar::fa::op::trim</b> for that instead.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>::grammar::fa::op::trim</b> <i>fa</i> ?<i>what</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Removes unwanted baggage from <i>fa</i>. The legal values for <i>what</i>
      are listed below. The command defaults to <b>!reachable|!useful</b> if no
      specific argument was given.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>!reachable</b></dt>
  <dd>Removes all states which are not reachable from a start state.</dd>
  <dt><b>!useful</b></dt>
  <dd>Removes all states which are unable to reach a final state.</dd>
  <dt><b>!reachable&amp;!useful</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>!(reachable|useful)</b></dt>
  <dd>Removes all states which are not reachable from a start state and are
      unable to reach a final state.</dd>
  <dt><b>!reachable|!useful</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>!(reachable&amp;useful)</b></dt>
  <dd>Removes all states which are not reachable from a start state or are
      unable to reach a final state.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>::grammar::fa::op::determinize</b> <i>fa</i> ?<i>mapvar</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Makes the <i>fa</i> deterministic without changing the language accepted
      by the <i>fa</i>. However nothing is done if the <i>fa</i> is already
      <i>deterministic</i>. This implies that only the first in a series of
      multiple consecutive complete operations on <i>fa</i> will perform
      anything. The remainder will be null operations.
    <p class="Pp">The command will store a dictionary describing the
        relationship between the new states of the resulting dfa and the states
        of the input nfa in <i>mapvar</i>, if it has been specified. Keys of the
        dictionary are the handles for the states of the resulting dfa, values
        are sets of states from the input nfa.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>Note</i>: An empty dictionary signals that the command was
        able to make the <i>fa</i> deterministic without performing a full
        subset construction, just by removing states and shuffling transitions
        around (As part of making the FA epsilon-free).</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>Note</i>: The algorithm fails to make the FA deterministic
        in the technical sense if the FA has no start state(s), because
        determinism requires the FA to have exactly one start states. In that
        situation we make a best effort; and the missing start state will be the
        only condition preventing the generated result from being
        <i>deterministic</i>. It should also be noted that in this case the
        possibilities for trimming states from the FA are also severely reduced
        as we cannot declare states unreachable.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>::grammar::fa::op::minimize</b> <i>fa</i> ?<i>mapvar</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Creates a FA which accepts the same language as <i>fa</i>, but has a
      minimal number of states. Uses Brzozowski's method to accomplish this.
    <p class="Pp">The command will store a dictionary describing the
        relationship between the new states of the resulting minimal fa and the
        states of the input fa in <i>mapvar</i>, if it has been specified. Keys
        of the dictionary are the handles for the states of the resulting
        minimal fa, values are sets of states from the input fa.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>Note</i>: An empty dictionary signals that the command was
        able to minimize the <i>fa</i> without having to compute new states.
        This should happen if and only if the input FA was already minimal.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>Note</i>: If the algorithm has no start or final states to
        work with then the result might be technically minimal, but have a very
        unexpected structure. It should also be noted that in this case the
        possibilities for trimming states from the FA are also severely reduced
        as we cannot declare states unreachable.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><i>Language operations</i> All operations in this section require
    that all input FAs have at least one start and at least one final state.
    Otherwise the language of the FAs will not be defined, making the operation
    senseless (as it operates on the languages of the FAs in a defined
  manner).</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>::grammar::fa::op::complement</b> <i>fa</i></dt>
  <dd>Complements <i>fa</i>. This is possible if and only if <i>fa</i> is
      <i>complete</i> and <i>deterministic</i>. The resulting FA accepts the
      complementary language of <i>fa</i>. In other words, all inputs not
      accepted by the input are accepted by the result, and vice versa.
    <p class="Pp">The result will have all states and transitions of the input,
        and different final states.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>::grammar::fa::op::kleene</b> <i>fa</i></dt>
  <dd>Applies Kleene's closure to <i>fa</i>. The resulting FA accepts all
      strings <b>S</b> for which we can find a natural number <b>n</b> (0
      inclusive) and strings <b>A1</b> ... <b>An</b> in the language of
      <i>fa</i> such that <b>S</b> is the concatenation of <b>A1</b> ...
      <b>An</b>. In other words, the language of the result is the infinite
      union over finite length concatenations over the language of <i>fa</i>.
    <p class="Pp">The result will have all states and transitions of the input,
        and new start and final states.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>::grammar::fa::op::optional</b> <i>fa</i></dt>
  <dd>Makes the <i>fa</i> optional. In other words it computes the FA which
      accepts the language of <i>fa</i> and the empty the word (epsilon) as
      well.
    <p class="Pp">The result will have all states and transitions of the input,
        and new start and final states.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>::grammar::fa::op::union</b> <i>fa</i> <i>fb</i> ?<i>mapvar</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Combines the FAs <i>fa</i> and <i>fb</i> such that the resulting FA
      accepts the union of the languages of the two FAs.
    <p class="Pp">The result will have all states and transitions of the two
        input FAs, and new start and final states. All states of <i>fb</i> which
        exist in <i>fa</i> as well will be renamed, and the <i>mapvar</i> will
        contain a mapping from the old states of <i>fb</i> to the new ones, if
        present.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It should be noted that the result will be non-deterministic,
        even if the inputs are deterministic.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>::grammar::fa::op::intersect</b> <i>fa</i> <i>fb</i>
    ?<i>mapvar</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Combines the FAs <i>fa</i> and <i>fb</i> such that the resulting FA
      accepts the intersection of the languages of the two FAs. In other words,
      the result will accept a word if and only if the word is accepted by both
      <i>fa</i> and <i>fb</i>. The result will be useful, but not necessarily
      deterministic or minimal.
    <p class="Pp">The command will store a dictionary describing the
        relationship between the new states of the resulting fa and the pairs of
        states of the input FAs in <i>mapvar</i>, if it has been specified. Keys
        of the dictionary are the handles for the states of the resulting fa,
        values are pairs of states from the input FAs. Pairs are represented by
        lists. The first element in each pair will be a state in <i>fa</i>, the
        second element will be drawn from <i>fb</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>::grammar::fa::op::difference</b> <i>fa</i> <i>fb</i>
    ?<i>mapvar</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Combines the FAs <i>fa</i> and <i>fb</i> such that the resulting FA
      accepts the difference of the languages of the two FAs. In other words,
      the result will accept a word if and only if the word is accepted by
      <i>fa</i>, but not by <i>fb</i>. This can also be expressed as the
      intersection of <i>fa</i> with the complement of <i>fb</i>. The result
      will be useful, but not necessarily deterministic or minimal.
    <p class="Pp">The command will store a dictionary describing the
        relationship between the new states of the resulting fa and the pairs of
        states of the input FAs in <i>mapvar</i>, if it has been specified. Keys
        of the dictionary are the handles for the states of the resulting fa,
        values are pairs of states from the input FAs. Pairs are represented by
        lists. The first element in each pair will be a state in <i>fa</i>, the
        second element will be drawn from <i>fb</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>::grammar::fa::op::concatenate</b> <i>fa</i> <i>fb</i>
    ?<i>mapvar</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Combines the FAs <i>fa</i> and <i>fb</i> such that the resulting FA
      accepts the cross-product of the languages of the two FAs. I.e. a word W
      will be accepted by the result if there are two words A and B accepted by
      <i>fa</i>, and <i>fb</i> resp. and W is the concatenation of A and B.
    <p class="Pp">The result FA will be non-deterministic.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>::grammar::fa::op::fromRegex</b> <i>fa</i> <i>regex</i>
    ?<i>over</i>?</dt>
  <dd>Generates a non-deterministic FA which accepts the same language as the
      regular expression <i>regex</i>. If the <i>over</i> is specified it is
      treated as the set of symbols the regular expression and the automaton are
      defined over. The command will compute the set from the &quot;S&quot;
      constructors in <i>regex</i> when <i>over</i> was not specified. This set
      is important if and only if the complement operator &quot;!&quot; is used
      in <i>regex</i> as the complementary language of an FA is quite different
      for different sets of symbols.
    <p class="Pp">The regular expression is represented by a nested list, which
        forms a syntax tree. The following structures are legal:</p>
