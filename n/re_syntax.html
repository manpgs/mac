   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">A <i>regular expression</i> describes strings of characters. It's
    a pattern that matches certain strings and does not match others.</p>

  FLAVORS OF REs</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Regular expressions (&#x201C;RE&#x201D;s), as defined by POSIX,
    come in two flavors: <i>extended</i> REs (&#x201C;ERE&#x201D;s) and
    <i>basic</i> REs (&#x201C;BRE&#x201D;s). EREs are roughly those of the
    traditional <i>egrep</i>, while BREs are roughly those of the traditional
    <i>ed</i>. This implementation adds a third flavor, <i>advanced</i> REs
    (&#x201C;ARE&#x201D;s), basically EREs with some significant extensions.</p>
<p class="Pp">This manual page primarily describes AREs. BREs mostly exist for
    backward compatibility in some old programs; they will be discussed at the
    end. POSIX EREs are almost an exact subset of AREs. Features of AREs that
    are not present in EREs will be indicated.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="REGULAR_EXPRESSION_SYNTAX"><a class="permalink" href="#REGULAR_EXPRESSION_SYNTAX">REGULAR
  EXPRESSION SYNTAX</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Tcl regular expressions are implemented using the package written
    by Henry Spencer, based on the 1003.2 spec and some (not quite all) of the
    Perl5 extensions (thanks, Henry!). Much of the description of regular
    expressions below is copied verbatim from his manual entry.</p>
<p class="Pp">An ARE is one or more <i>branches</i>, separated by
    &#x201C;<b>|</b>&#x201D;, matching anything that matches any of the
    branches.</p>
<p class="Pp">A branch is zero or more <i>constraints</i> or <i>quantified
    atoms</i>, concatenated. It matches a match for the first, followed by a
    match for the second, etc; an empty branch matches the empty string.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="QUANTIFIERS"><a class="permalink" href="#QUANTIFIERS">QUANTIFIERS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A quantified atom is an <i>atom</i> possibly followed by a single
    <i>quantifier</i>. Without a quantifier, it matches a single match for the
    atom. The quantifiers, and what a so-quantified atom matches, are:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom</dd>
  <dt><b>+</b></dt>
  <dd>a sequence of 1 or more matches of the atom</dd>
  <dt><b>?</b></dt>
  <dd>a sequence of 0 or 1 matches of the atom</dd>
  <dt><b>{</b><i>m</i><b>}</b></dt>
  <dd>a sequence of exactly <i>m</i> matches of the atom</dd>
  <dt><b>{</b><i>m</i><b>,}</b></dt>
  <dd>a sequence of <i>m</i> or more matches of the atom</dd>
  <dt><b>{</b><i>m</i><b>,</b><i>n</i><b>}</b></dt>
  <dd>a sequence of <i>m</i> through <i>n</i> (inclusive) matches of the atom;

  <dt><b>*? +? ?? {</b><i>m</i><b>}? {</b><i>m</i><b>,}?
    {</b><i>m</i><b>,</b><i>n</i><b>}?</b></dt>
  <dd><i>non-greedy</i> quantifiers, which match the same possibilities, but
      prefer the smallest number rather than the largest number of matches (see
      <b>MATCHING</b>)</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The forms using <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> are known as <i>bound</i>s.
    The numbers <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are unsigned decimal integers with

<h1 class="Sh" id="BRACKET_EXPRESSIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#BRACKET_EXPRESSIONS">BRACKET
  EXPRESSIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A <i>bracket expression</i> is a list of characters enclosed in
    &#x201C;<b>[]</b>&#x201D;. It normally matches any single character from the
    list (but see below). If the list begins with &#x201C;<b>^</b>&#x201D;, it
    matches any single character (but see below) <i>not</i> from the rest of the
    list.</p>
<p class="Pp">If two characters in the list are separated by
    &#x201C;<b>-</b>&#x201D;, this is shorthand for the full <i>range</i> of
    characters between those two (inclusive) in the collating sequence, e.g.
    &#x201C;<b>[0-9]</b>&#x201D; in Unicode matches any conventional decimal
    digit. Two ranges may not share an endpoint, so e.g.
    &#x201C;<b>a-c-e</b>&#x201D; is illegal. Ranges in Tcl always use the
    Unicode collating sequence, but other programs may use other collating
    sequences and this can be a source of incompatability between programs.</p>
<p class="Pp">To include a literal <b>]</b> or <b>-</b> in the list, the
    simplest method is to enclose it in <b>[.</b> and <b>.]</b> to make it a
    collating element (see below). Alternatively, make it the first character
    (following a possible &#x201C;<b>^</b>&#x201D;), or (AREs only) precede it
    with &#x201C;<b>\</b>&#x201D;. Alternatively, for &#x201C;<b>-</b>&#x201D;,
    make it the last character, or the second endpoint of a range. To use a
    literal <b>-</b> as the first endpoint of a range, make it a collating
    element or (AREs only) precede it with &#x201C;<b>\</b>&#x201D;. With the
    exception of these, some combinations using <b>[</b> (see next paragraphs),
    and escapes, all other special characters lose their special significance
    within a bracket expression.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="CHARACTER_CLASSES"><a class="permalink" href="#CHARACTER_CLASSES">CHARACTER
  CLASSES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Within a bracket expression, the name of a <i>character class</i>
    enclosed in <b>[:</b> and <b>:]</b> stands for the list of all characters
    (not all collating elements!) belonging to that class. Standard character
    classes are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

<h2 class="Ss" id="BRACKETED_CONSTRAINTS"><a class="permalink" href="#BRACKETED_CONSTRAINTS">BRACKETED
  CONSTRAINTS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There are two special cases of bracket expressions: the bracket
    expressions &#x201C;<b>[[:&lt;:]]</b>&#x201D; and
    &#x201C;<b>[[:&gt;:]]</b>&#x201D; are constraints, matching empty strings at
    the beginning and end of a word respectively. A word is defined as a
    sequence of word characters that is neither preceded nor followed by word
    characters. A word character is an <i>alnum</i> character or an underscore
    (&#x201C;<b>_</b>&#x201D;). These special bracket expressions are
    deprecated; users of AREs should use constraint escapes instead (see
  below).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="COLLATING_ELEMENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#COLLATING_ELEMENTS">COLLATING
  ELEMENTS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Within a bracket expression, a collating element (a character, a
    multi-character sequence that collates as if it were a single character, or
    a collating-sequence name for either) enclosed in <b>[.</b> and <b>.]</b>
    stands for the sequence of characters of that collating element. The
    sequence is a single element of the bracket expression's list. A bracket
    expression in a locale that has multi-character collating elements can thus
    match more than one character. So (insidiously), a bracket expression that
    starts with <b>^</b> can match multi-character collating elements even if
    none of them appear in the bracket expression!</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">(<i>Note:</i> Tcl has no multi-character collating elements. This
    information is only for illustration.)</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">For example, assume the collating sequence includes a <b>ch</b>
    multi-character collating element. Then the RE
    &#x201C;<b>[[.ch.]]*c</b>&#x201D; (zero or more &#x201C;<b>ch</b>s&#x201D;
    followed by &#x201C;<b>c</b>&#x201D;) matches the first five characters of
    &#x201C;<b>chchcc</b>&#x201D;. Also, the RE &#x201C;<b>[^c]b</b>&#x201D;
    matches all of &#x201C;<b>chb</b>&#x201D; (because
    &#x201C;<b>[^c]</b>&#x201D; matches the multi-character
    &#x201C;<b>ch</b>&#x201D;).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="EQUIVALENCE_CLASSES"><a class="permalink" href="#EQUIVALENCE_CLASSES">EQUIVALENCE
  CLASSES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Within a bracket expression, a collating element enclosed in
    <b>[=</b> and <b>=]</b> is an equivalence class, standing for the sequences
    of characters of all collating elements equivalent to that one, including
    itself. (If there are no other equivalent collating elements, the treatment
    is as if the enclosing delimiters were &#x201C;<b>[.</b>&#x201D; and
    &#x201C;<b>.]</b>&#x201D;.) For example, if <b>o</b> and <b>&#x00F4;</b> are
    the members of an equivalence class, then &#x201C;<b>[[=o=]]</b>&#x201D;,
    &#x201C;<b>[[=&#x00F4;=]]</b>&#x201D;, and
    &#x201C;<b>[o&#x00F4;]</b>&#x201D; are all synonymous. An equivalence class
    may not be an endpoint of a range.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

    define any equivalence classes. The examples above are just
  illustrations.)</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ESCAPES"><a class="permalink" href="#ESCAPES">ESCAPES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Escapes (AREs only), which begin with a <b>\</b> followed by an
    alphanumeric character, come in several varieties: character entry, class
    shorthands, constraint escapes, and back references. A <b>\</b> followed by
    an alphanumeric character but not constituting a valid escape is illegal in
    AREs. In EREs, there are no escapes: outside a bracket expression, a
    <b>\</b> followed by an alphanumeric character merely stands for that
    character as an ordinary character, and inside a bracket expression,
    <b>\</b> is an ordinary character. (The latter is the one actual
    incompatibility between EREs and AREs.)</p>

    does not terminate a bracket expression. Beware, however, that some
    applications (e.g., C compilers and the Tcl interpreter if the regular
    expression is not quoted with braces) interpret such sequences themselves
    before the regular-expression package gets to see them, which may require

      capturing parentheses seen so far) a <i>back reference</i>, see below</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">A word is defined as in the specification of
    &#x201C;<b>[[:&lt;:]]</b>&#x201D; and &#x201C;<b>[[:&gt;:]]</b>&#x201D;
    above. Constraint escapes are illegal within bracket expressions.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="BACK_REFERENCES"><a class="permalink" href="#BACK_REFERENCES">BACK
  REFERENCES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A back reference (AREs only) matches the same string matched by
    the parenthesized subexpression specified by the number, so that (e.g.)
    &#x201C;<b>([bc])\1</b>&#x201D; matches &#x201C;<b>bb</b>&#x201D; or
    &#x201C;<b>cc</b>&#x201D; but not &#x201C;<b>bc</b>&#x201D;. The
    subexpression must entirely precede the back reference in the RE.
    Subexpressions are numbered in the order of their leading parentheses.
    Non-capturing parentheses do not define subexpressions.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is an inherent historical ambiguity between octal
    character-entry escapes and back references, which is resolved by
    heuristics, as hinted at above. A leading zero always indicates an octal
    escape. A single non-zero digit, not followed by another digit, is always
    taken as a back reference. A multi-digit sequence not starting with a zero
    is taken as a back reference if it comes after a suitable subexpression
    (i.e. the number is in the legal range for a back reference), and otherwise
    is taken as octal.</p>

<p class="Pp">In addition to the main syntax described above, there are some
    special forms and miscellaneous syntactic facilities available.</p>
<p class="Pp">Normally the flavor of RE being used is specified by
    application-dependent means. However, this can be overridden by a
    <i>director</i>. If an RE of any flavor begins with
    &#x201C;<b>***:</b>&#x201D;, the rest of the RE is an ARE. If an RE of any
    flavor begins with &#x201C;<b>***=</b>&#x201D;, the rest of the RE is taken
    to be a literal string, with all characters considered ordinary
  characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">An ARE may begin with <i>embedded options</i>: a sequence
    <b>(?</b><i>xyz</i><b>)</b> (where <i>xyz</i> is one or more alphabetic
    characters) specifies options affecting the rest of the RE. These
    supplement, and can override, any options specified by the application. The
    available option letters are:</p>

</div>
<p class="Pp">Embedded options take effect at the <b>)</b> terminating the
    sequence. They are available only at the start of an ARE, and may not be
    used later within it.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to the usual (<i>tight</i>) RE syntax, in which all
    characters are significant, there is an <i>expanded</i> syntax, available in
    all flavors of RE with the <b>-expanded</b> switch, or in AREs with the
    embedded x option. In the expanded syntax, white-space characters are
    ignored and all characters between a <b>#</b> and the following newline (or
    the end of the RE) are ignored, permitting paragraphing and commenting a
    complex RE. There are three exceptions to that basic rule:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>a white-space character or &#x201C;<b>#</b>&#x201D; preceded by
      &#x201C;<b>\</b>&#x201D; is retained</li>
  <li>white space or &#x201C;<b>#</b>&#x201D; within a bracket expression is
      retained</li>
  <li>white space and comments are illegal within multi-character symbols like
      the ARE &#x201C;<b>(?:</b>&#x201D; or the BRE
    &#x201C;<b>\(</b>&#x201D;</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Expanded-syntax white-space characters are blank, tab, newline,
    and any character that belongs to the <i>space</i> character class.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, in an ARE, outside bracket expressions, the sequence
    &#x201C;<b>(?#</b><i>ttt</i><b>)</b>&#x201D; (where <i>ttt</i> is any text
    not containing a &#x201C;<b>)</b>&#x201D;) is a comment, completely ignored.
    Again, this is not allowed between the characters of multi-character symbols
    like &#x201C;<b>(?:</b>&#x201D;. Such comments are more a historical
    artifact than a useful facility, and their use is deprecated; use the
    expanded syntax instead.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>None</i> of these metasyntax extensions is available if the
    application (or an initial &#x201C;<b>***=</b>&#x201D; director) has
    specified that the user's input be treated as a literal string rather than
    as an RE.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MATCHING"><a class="permalink" href="#MATCHING">MATCHING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In the event that an RE could match more than one substring of a
    given string, the RE matches the one starting earliest in the string. If the
    RE could match more than one substring starting at that point, its choice is
    determined by its <i>preference</i>: either the longest substring, or the
    shortest.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most atoms, and all constraints, have no preference. A
    parenthesized RE has the same preference (possibly none) as the RE. A
    quantified atom with quantifier <b>{</b><i>m</i><b>}</b> or
    <b>{</b><i>m</i><b>}?</b> has the same preference (possibly none) as the
    atom itself. A quantified atom with other normal quantifiers (including
    <b>{</b><i>m</i><b>,</b><i>n</i><b>}</b> with <i>m</i> equal to <i>n</i>)
    prefers longest match. A quantified atom with other non-greedy quantifiers
    (including <b>{</b><i>m</i><b>,</b><i>n</i><b>}?</b> with <i>m</i> equal to
    <i>n</i>) prefers shortest match. A branch has the same preference as the
    first quantified atom in it which has a preference. An RE consisting of two
    or more branches connected by the <b>|</b> operator prefers longest
  match.</p>
<p class="Pp">Subject to the constraints imposed by the rules for matching the
    whole RE, subexpressions also match the longest or shortest possible
    substrings, based on their preferences, with subexpressions starting earlier
    in the RE taking priority over ones starting later. Note that outer
    subexpressions thus take priority over their component subexpressions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the quantifiers <b>{1,1}</b> and <b>{1,1}?</b> can be
    used to force longest and shortest preference, respectively, on a
    subexpression or a whole RE.</p>
<p class="Pp">Match lengths are measured in characters, not collating elements.
    An empty string is considered longer than no match at all. For example,
    &#x201C;<b>bb*</b>&#x201D; matches the three middle characters of
    &#x201C;<b>abbbc</b>&#x201D;,
    &#x201C;<b>(week|wee)(night|knights)</b>&#x201D; matches all ten characters
    of &#x201C;<b>weeknights</b>&#x201D;, when &#x201C;<b>(.*).*</b>&#x201D; is
    matched against &#x201C;<b>abc</b>&#x201D; the parenthesized subexpression
    matches all three characters, and when &#x201C;<b>(a*)*</b>&#x201D; is
    matched against &#x201C;<b>bc</b>&#x201D; both the whole RE and the
    parenthesized subexpression match an empty string.</p>
<p class="Pp">If case-independent matching is specified, the effect is much as
    if all case distinctions had vanished from the alphabet. When an alphabetic
    that exists in multiple cases appears as an ordinary character outside a
    bracket expression, it is effectively transformed into a bracket expression
    containing both cases, so that <b>x</b> becomes &#x201C;<b>[xX]</b>&#x201D;.
    When it appears inside a bracket expression, all case counterparts of it are
    added to the bracket expression, so that &#x201C;<b>[x]</b>&#x201D; becomes
    &#x201C;<b>[xX]</b>&#x201D; and &#x201C;<b>[^x]</b>&#x201D; becomes
    &#x201C;<b>[^xX]</b>&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="Pp">If newline-sensitive matching is specified, <b>.</b> and bracket
    expressions using <b>^</b> will never match the newline character (so that
    matches will never cross newlines unless the RE explicitly arranges it) and
    <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> will match the empty string after and before a newline
    respectively, in addition to matching at beginning and end of string
    respectively. ARE <b>\A</b> and <b>\Z</b> continue to match beginning or end
    of string <i>only</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If partial newline-sensitive matching is specified, this affects
    <b>.</b> and bracket expressions as with newline-sensitive matching, but not
    <b>^</b> and <b>$</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If inverse partial newline-sensitive matching is specified, this
    affects <b>^</b> and <b>$</b> as with newline-sensitive matching, but not
    <b>.</b> and bracket expressions. This is not very useful but is provided
    for symmetry.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="LIMITS_AND_COMPATIBILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#LIMITS_AND_COMPATIBILITY">LIMITS
  AND COMPATIBILITY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">No particular limit is imposed on the length of REs. Programs
    intended to be highly portable should not employ REs longer than 256 bytes,
    as a POSIX-compliant implementation can refuse to accept such REs.</p>
<p class="Pp">The only feature of AREs that is actually incompatible with POSIX
    EREs is that <b>\</b> does not lose its special significance inside bracket
    expressions. All other ARE features use syntax which is illegal or has
    undefined or unspecified effects in POSIX EREs; the <b>***</b> syntax of
    directors likewise is outside the POSIX syntax for both BREs and EREs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the ARE extensions are borrowed from Perl, but some have
    been changed to clean them up, and a few Perl extensions are not present.
    Incompatibilities of note include &#x201C;<b>\b</b>&#x201D;,
    &#x201C;<b>\B</b>&#x201D;, the lack of special treatment for a trailing
    newline, the addition of complemented bracket expressions to the things
    affected by newline-sensitive matching, the restrictions on parentheses and
    back references in lookahead constraints, and the longest/shortest-match
    (rather than first-match) matching semantics.</p>
<p class="Pp">The matching rules for REs containing both normal and non-greedy
    quantifiers have changed since early beta-test versions of this package.
    (The new rules are much simpler and cleaner, but do not work as hard at
    guessing the user's real intentions.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Henry Spencer's original 1986 <i>regexp</i> package, still in
    widespread use (e.g., in pre-8.1 releases of Tcl), implemented an early
    version of today's EREs. There are four incompatibilities between
    <i>regexp</i>'s near-EREs (&#x201C;RREs&#x201D; for short) and AREs. In
    roughly increasing order of significance:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>In AREs, <b>\</b> followed by an alphanumeric character is either an
      escape or an error, while in RREs, it was just another way of writing the
      alphanumeric. This should not be a problem because there was no reason to
      write such a sequence in RREs.</li>
  <li><b>{</b> followed by a digit in an ARE is the beginning of a bound, while
      in RREs, <b>{</b> was always an ordinary character. Such sequences should
      be rare, and will often result in an error because following characters
      will not look like a valid bound.</li>
  <li>In AREs, <b>\</b> remains a special character within
      &#x201C;<b>[]</b>&#x201D;, so a literal <b>\</b> within <b>[]</b> must be
      written &#x201C;<b>\\</b>&#x201D;. <b>\\</b> also gives a literal <b>\</b>
      within <b>[]</b> in RREs, but only truly paranoid programmers routinely
      doubled the backslash.</li>
  <li>AREs report the longest/shortest match for the RE, rather than the first
      found in a specified search order. This may affect some RREs which were
      written in the expectation that the first match would be reported. (The
      careful crafting of RREs to optimize the search order for fast matching is
      obsolete (AREs examine all possible matches in parallel, and their
      performance is largely insensitive to their complexity) but cases where
      the search order was exploited to deliberately find a match which was
      <i>not</i> the longest/shortest will need rewriting.)</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BASIC_REGULAR_EXPRESSIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#BASIC_REGULAR_EXPRESSIONS">BASIC
  REGULAR EXPRESSIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">BREs differ from EREs in several respects.
    &#x201C;<b>|</b>&#x201D;, &#x201C;<b>+</b>&#x201D;, and <b>?</b> are
    ordinary characters and there is no equivalent for their functionality. The
    delimiters for bounds are <b>\{</b> and &#x201C;<b>\}</b>&#x201D;, with
    <b>{</b> and <b>}</b> by themselves ordinary characters. The parentheses for
    nested subexpressions are <b>\(</b> and &#x201C;<b>\)</b>&#x201D;, with
    <b>(</b> and <b>)</b> by themselves ordinary characters. <b>^</b> is an
    ordinary character except at the beginning of the RE or the beginning of a
    parenthesized subexpression, <b>$</b> is an ordinary character except at the
    end of the RE or the end of a parenthesized subexpression, and <b>*</b> is
    an ordinary character if it appears at the beginning of the RE or the
    beginning of a parenthesized subexpression (after a possible leading
    &#x201C;<b>^</b>&#x201D;). Finally, single-digit back references are
    available, and <b>\&lt;</b> and <b>\&gt;</b> are synonyms for
