   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   SCCS: @(#) man.macros 1.9 97/08/22 18:50:59
  
  	# Set up traps and other miscellaneous stuff for Tcl/Tk man pages.

<p class="Pp">The following global variables are created and managed
    automatically by the <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> library. Except where noted
    below, these variables should normally be treated as read-only by
    application-specific code and by users.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="itcl::library"><a class="permalink" href="#itcl::library"><b>itcl::library</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When an interpreter is created, <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> initializes this
      variable to hold the name of a directory containing the system library of
      <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> scripts. The initial value of
      <b>itcl::library</b> is set from the ITCL_LIBRARY environment variable if
      it exists, or from a compiled-in value otherwise.</dd>
  <dt id="itcl::patchLevel"><a class="permalink" href="#itcl::patchLevel"><b>itcl::patchLevel</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When an interpreter is created, <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> initializes this
      variable to hold the current patch level for <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b>. For
      example, the value &quot;<b>2.0p1</b>&quot; indicates
      <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> version 2.0 with the first set of patches
      applied.</dd>
  <dt id="itcl::purist"><a class="permalink" href="#itcl::purist"><b>itcl::purist</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When an interpreter is created containing Tcl/Tk and the
      <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> namespace facility, this variable controls a
      &quot;backward-compatibility&quot; mode for widget access.
    <p class="Pp">In vanilla Tcl/Tk, there is a single pool of commands, so the
        access command for a widget is the same as the window name. When a
        widget is created within a namespace, however, its access command is
        installed in that namespace, and should be accessed outside of the
        namespace using a qualified name. For example,</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
namespace foo {
    namespace bar {
        button .b -text &quot;Testing&quot;
    }
}
foo::bar::.b configure -background red
pack .b
</pre>
</div>
Note that the window name &quot;.b&quot; is still used in conjunction with
  commands like <b>pack</b> and <b>destroy</b>. However, the access command for
  the widget (i.e., name that appears as the <i>first</i> argument on a command
  line) must be more specific.
<p class="Pp">The &quot;<b>winfo command</b>&quot; command can be used to query
    the fully-qualified access command for any widget, so one can write:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
[winfo command .b] configure -background red
</pre>
</div>
and this is good practice when writing library procedures. Also, in conjunction
  with the <b>bind</b> command, the &quot;%q&quot; field can be used in place of
  &quot;%W&quot; as the access command:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
bind Button &lt;Key-Return&gt; {%q flash; %q invoke}
</pre>
</div>
While this behavior makes sense from the standpoint of encapsulation, it causes
  problems with existing Tcl/Tk applications. Many existing applications are
  written with bindings that use &quot;%W&quot;. Many library procedures assume
  that the window name is the access command.
<p class="Pp">The <b>itcl::purist</b> variable controls a backward-compatibility
    mode. By default, this variable is &quot;0&quot;, and the window name can be
    used as an access command in any context. Whenever the <b>unknown</b>
    procedure stumbles across a widget name, it simply uses &quot;<b>winfo
    command</b>&quot; to determine the appropriate command name. If this
    variable is set to &quot;1&quot;, this backward-compatibility mode is
    disabled. This gives better encapsulation, but using the window name as the
    access command may lead to &quot;invalid command&quot; errors.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="itcl::version"><a class="permalink" href="#itcl::version"><b>itcl::version</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When an interpreter is created, <b>[incr&#x00A0;Tcl]</b> initializes this
      variable to hold the version number of the form <i>x.y</i>. Changes to
      <i>x</i> represent major changes with probable incompatibilities and
      changes to <i>y</i> represent small enhancements and bug fixes that retain
      backward compatibility.
