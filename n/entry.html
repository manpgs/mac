   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">[<span class="Op"><b>-disabledbackground</b>
    <i>disabledBackground</i>]</span> Specifies the background color to use when
    the entry is disabled. If this option is the empty string, the normal
    background color is used. [<span class="Op"><b>-disabledforeground</b>
    <i>disabledForeground</i>]</span> Specifies the foreground color to use when
    the entry is disabled. If this option is the empty string, the normal
    foreground color is used. [<span class="Op"><b>-invalidcommand or
    -invcmd</b> <i>invalidCommand</i>]</span> Specifies a script to eval when
    <b>validateCommand</b> returns 0. Setting it to {} disables this feature
    (the default). The best use of this option is to set it to <i>bell</i>. See
    <b>Validation</b> below for more information.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-readonlybackground</b>
    <i>readonlyBackground</i>]</span> Specifies the background color to use when
    the entry is readonly. If this option is the empty string, the normal
    background color is used. [<span class="Op"><b>-show</b> <i>show</i>]</span>
    If this option is specified, then the true contents of the entry are not
    displayed in the window. Instead, each character in the entry's value will
    be displayed as the first character in the value of this option, such as
    &#x201C;*&#x201D;. This is useful, for example, if the entry is to be used
    to enter a password. If characters in the entry are selected and copied
    elsewhere, the information copied will be what is displayed, not the true
    contents of the entry. [<span class="Op"><b>-state</b> <i>state</i>]</span>
    Specifies one of three states for the entry: <b>normal</b>, <b>disabled</b>,
    or <b>readonly</b>. If the entry is readonly, then the value may not be
    changed using widget commands and no insertion cursor will be displayed,
    even if the input focus is in the widget; the contents of the widget may
    still be selected. If the entry is disabled, the value may not be changed,
    no insertion cursor will be displayed, the contents will not be selectable,
    and the entry may be displayed in a different color, depending on the values
    of the <b>-disabledforeground</b> and <b>-disabledbackground</b> options.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-validate</b> <i>validate</i>]</span> Specifies the
    mode in which validation should operate: <b>none</b>, <b>focus</b>,
    <b>focusin</b>, <b>focusout</b>, <b>key</b>, or <b>all</b>. It defaults to
    <b>none</b>. When you want validation, you must explicitly state which mode
    you wish to use. See <b>Validation</b> below for more.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-validatecommand or -vcmd</b>
    <i>validateCommand</i>]</span> Specifies a script to eval when you want to
    validate the input into the entry widget. Setting it to {} disables this
    feature (the default). This command must return a valid Tcl boolean value.
    If it returns 0 (or the valid Tcl boolean equivalent) then it means you
    reject the new edition and it will not occur and the <b>invalidCommand</b>
    will be evaluated if it is set. If it returns 1, then the new edition
    occurs. See <b>Validation</b> below for more information.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-width</b> <i>width</i>]</span> Specifies an integer
    value indicating the desired width of the entry window, in average-size
    characters of the widget's font. If the value is less than or equal to zero,
    the widget picks a size just large enough to hold its current text.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <b>entry</b> command creates a new window (given by the
    <i>pathName</i> argument) and makes it into an entry widget. Additional
    options, described above, may be specified on the command line or in the
    option database to configure aspects of the entry such as its colors, font,
    and relief. The <b>entry</b> command returns its <i>pathName</i> argument.
    At the time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
    <i>pathName</i>, but <i>pathName</i>'s parent must exist.</p>
<p class="Pp">An entry is a widget that displays a one-line text string and
    allows that string to be edited using widget commands described below, which
    are typically bound to keystrokes and mouse actions. When first created, an
    entry's string is empty. A portion of the entry may be selected as described
    below. If an entry is exporting its selection (see the
    <b>exportSelection</b> option), then it will observe the standard X11
    protocols for handling the selection; entry selections are available as type
    <b>STRING</b>. Entries also observe the standard Tk rules for dealing with
    the input focus. When an entry has the input focus it displays an
    <i>insertion cursor</i> to indicate where new characters will be
  inserted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Entries are capable of displaying strings that are too long to fit
    entirely within the widget's window. In this case, only a portion of the
    string will be displayed; commands described below may be used to change the
    view in the window. Entries use the standard <b>xScrollCommand</b> mechanism
    for interacting with scrollbars (see the description of the
    <b>xScrollCommand</b> option for details). They also support scanning, as
    described below.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="VALIDATION"><a class="permalink" href="#VALIDATION">VALIDATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Validation works by setting the <b>validateCommand</b> option to a
    script which will be evaluated according to the <b>validate</b> option as
    follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="none"><a class="permalink" href="#none"><b>none</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Default. This means no validation will occur.</dd>
  <dt id="focus"><a class="permalink" href="#focus"><b>focus</b></a></dt>
  <dd><b>validateCommand</b> will be called when the entry receives or loses
      focus.</dd>
  <dt id="focusin"><a class="permalink" href="#focusin"><b>focusin</b></a></dt>
  <dd><b>validateCommand</b> will be called when the entry receives focus.</dd>
  <dt id="focusout"><a class="permalink" href="#focusout"><b>focusout</b></a></dt>
  <dd><b>validateCommand</b> will be called when the entry loses focus.</dd>
  <dt id="key"><a class="permalink" href="#key"><b>key</b></a></dt>
  <dd><b>validateCommand</b> will be called when the entry is edited.</dd>
  <dt id="all"><a class="permalink" href="#all"><b>all</b></a></dt>
  <dd><b>validateCommand</b> will be called for all above conditions.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">It is possible to perform percent substitutions on the
    <b>validateCommand</b> and <b>invalidCommand</b>, just as you would in a
    <b>bind</b> script. The following substitutions are recognized:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>%d</b></dt>
  <dd>Type of action: 1 for <b>insert</b>, 0 for <b>delete</b>, or -1 for focus,
      forced or textvariable validation.</dd>
  <dt><b>%i</b></dt>
  <dd>Index of char string to be inserted/deleted, if any, otherwise -1.</dd>
  <dt><b>%P</b></dt>
  <dd>The value of the entry if the edit is allowed. If you are configuring the
      entry widget to have a new textvariable, this will be the value of that
      textvariable.</dd>
  <dt><b>%s</b></dt>
  <dd>The current value of entry prior to editing.</dd>
  <dt><b>%S</b></dt>
  <dd>The text string being inserted/deleted, if any, {} otherwise.</dd>
  <dt><b>%v</b></dt>
  <dd>The type of validation currently set.</dd>
  <dt><b>%V</b></dt>
  <dd>The type of validation that triggered the callback (key, focusin,
      focusout, forced).</dd>
  <dt><b>%W</b></dt>
  <dd>The name of the entry widget.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In general, the <b>textVariable</b> and <b>validateCommand</b> can
    be dangerous to mix. Any problems have been overcome so that using the
    <b>validateCommand</b> will not interfere with the traditional behavior of
    the entry widget. Using the <b>textVariable</b> for read-only purposes will
    never cause problems. The danger comes when you try set the
    <b>textVariable</b> to something that the <b>validateCommand</b> would not
    accept, which causes <b>validate</b> to become <i>none</i> (the
    <b>invalidCommand</b> will not be triggered). The same happens when an error
    occurs evaluating the <b>validateCommand</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Primarily, an error will occur when the <b>validateCommand</b> or
    <b>invalidCommand</b> encounters an error in its script while evaluating or
    <b>validateCommand</b> does not return a valid Tcl boolean value. The
    <b>validate</b> option will also set itself to <b>none</b> when you edit the
    entry widget from within either the <b>validateCommand</b> or the
    <b>invalidCommand</b>. Such editions will override the one that was being
    validated. If you wish to edit the entry widget (for example set it to {})
    during validation and still have the <b>validate</b> option set, you should
    include the command</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
after idle {%W config -validate %v}
</pre>
</div>
in the <b>validateCommand</b> or <b>invalidCommand</b> (whichever one you were
  editing the entry widget from). It is also recommended to not set an
  associated <b>textVariable</b> during validation, as that can cause the entry
  widget to become out of sync with the <b>textVariable</b>.

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="WIDGET_COMMAND"><a class="permalink" href="#WIDGET_COMMAND">WIDGET
  COMMAND</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>entry</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
    <i>pathName</i>. This command may be used to invoke various operations on
    the widget. It has the following general form:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>pathName subcommand </i>?<i>arg arg ...</i>?
</pre>
</div>
<i>Subcommand</i> and the <i>arg</i>s determine the exact behavior of the
  command.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="INDICES"><a class="permalink" href="#INDICES">INDICES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Many of the widget commands for entries take one or more indices
    as arguments. An index specifies a particular character in the entry's
    string, in any of the following ways:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="number"><a class="permalink" href="#number"><i>number</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the character as a numerical index, where 0 corresponds to the
      first character in the string.</dd>
  <dt id="anchor"><a class="permalink" href="#anchor"><b>anchor</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates the anchor point for the selection, which is set with the
      <b>select from</b> and <b>select adjust</b> widget commands.</dd>
  <dt id="end"><a class="permalink" href="#end"><b>end</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates the character just after the last one in the entry's string.
      This is equivalent to specifying a numerical index equal to the length of
      the entry's string.</dd>
  <dt id="insert"><a class="permalink" href="#insert"><b>insert</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates the character adjacent to and immediately following the
      insertion cursor.</dd>
  <dt id="sel.first"><a class="permalink" href="#sel.first"><b>sel.first</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates the first character in the selection. It is an error to use this
      form if the selection is not in the entry window.</dd>
  <dt id="sel.last"><a class="permalink" href="#sel.last"><b>sel.last</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates the character just after the last one in the selection. It is an
      error to use this form if the selection is not in the entry window.</dd>
  <dt><b>@</b><i>number</i></dt>
  <dd>In this form, <i>number</i> is treated as an x-coordinate in the entry's
      window; the character spanning that x-coordinate is used. For example,
      &#x201C;<b>@0</b>&#x201D; indicates the left-most character in the
    window.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Abbreviations may be used for any of the forms above, e.g.
    &#x201C;<b>e</b>&#x201D; or &#x201C;<b>sel.f</b>&#x201D;. In general,
    out-of-range indices are automatically rounded to the nearest legal
  value.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="SUBCOMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#SUBCOMMANDS">SUBCOMMANDS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The following commands are possible for entry widgets:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="pathName"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName"><i>pathName
    </i><b>bbox </b><i>index</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns a list of four numbers describing the bounding box of the
      character given by <i>index</i>. The first two elements of the list give
      the x and y coordinates of the upper-left corner of the screen area
      covered by the character (in pixels relative to the widget) and the last
      two elements give the width and height of the character, in pixels. The
      bounding box may refer to a region outside the visible area of the
    window.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~2"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~2"><i>pathName
    </i><b>cget</b> <i>option</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
      <i>option</i>. <i>Option</i> may have any of the values accepted by the
      <b>entry</b> command.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~3"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~3"><i>pathName
    </i><b>configure</b> ?<i>option</i>? ?<i>value option value
    ...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
      <i>option</i> is specified, returns a list describing all of the available
      options for <i>pathName</i> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information
      on the format of this list). If <i>option</i> is specified with no
      <i>value</i>, then the command returns a list describing the one named
      option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the
      value returned if no <i>option</i> is specified). If one or more
      <i>option-value</i> pairs are specified, then the command modifies the
      given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the
      command returns an empty string. <i>Option</i> may have any of the values
      accepted by the <b>entry</b> command.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~4"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~4"><i>pathName
    </i><b>delete </b><i>first </i>?<i>last</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Delete one or more elements of the entry. <i>First</i> is the index of the
      first character to delete, and <i>last</i> is the index of the character
      just after the last one to delete. If <i>last</i> is not specified it
      defaults to <i>first</i>+1, i.e. a single character is deleted. This
      command returns an empty string.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~5"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~5"><i>pathName
    </i><b>get</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the entry's string.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~6"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~6"><i>pathName
    </i><b>icursor </b><i>index</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Arrange for the insertion cursor to be displayed just before the character
      given by <i>index</i>. Returns an empty string.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~7"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~7"><i>pathName
    </i><b>index</b><i> index</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the numerical index corresponding to <i>index</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~8"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~8"><i>pathName
    </i><b>insert </b><i>index string</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Insert the characters of <i>string</i> just before the character indicated
      by <i>index</i>. Returns an empty string.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~9"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~9"><i>pathName
    </i><b>scan</b> <i>option args</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This command is used to implement scanning on entries. It has two forms,
      depending on <i>option</i>:</dd>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="pathName~10"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~10"><i>pathName
    </i><b>scan mark </b><i>x</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Records <i>x</i> and the current view in the entry window; used in
      conjunction with later <b>scan dragto</b> commands. Typically this command
      is associated with a mouse button press in the widget. It returns an empty
      string.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~11"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~11"><i>pathName
    </i><b>scan dragto </b><i>x</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This command computes the difference between its <i>x</i> argument and the
      <i>x</i> argument to the last <b>scan mark</b> command for the widget. It
      then adjusts the view left or right by 10 times the difference in
      x-coordinates. This command is typically associated with mouse motion
      events in the widget, to produce the effect of dragging the entry at high
      speed through the window. The return value is an empty string.</dd>

      <i>index</i>, and adjust that end of the selection to be at <i>index</i>
      (i.e. including but not going beyond <i>index</i>). The other end of the
      selection is made the anchor point for future <b>select to</b> commands.
      If the selection is not currently in the entry, then a new selection is
      created to include the characters between <i>index</i> and the most recent
      selection anchor point, inclusive. Returns an empty string.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~14"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~14"><i>pathName

  <dd>If <i>index</i> is before the anchor point, set the selection to the
      characters from <i>index</i> up to but not including the anchor point. If
      <i>index</i> is the same as the anchor point, do nothing. If <i>index</i>
      is after the anchor point, set the selection to the characters from the
      anchor point up to but not including <i>index</i>. The anchor point is
      determined by the most recent <b>select from</b> or <b>select adjust</b>
      command in this widget. If the selection is not in this widget then a new
      selection is created using the most recent anchor point specified for the

      second element is .6, 20% of the entry's text is off-screen to the left,
      the middle 40% is visible in the window, and 40% of the text is off-screen
      to the right. These are the same values passed to scrollbars via the
      <b>-xscrollcommand</b> option.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~22"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~22"><i>pathName
    </i><b>xview</b> <i>index</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Adjusts the view in the window so that the character given by <i>index</i>
      is displayed at the left edge of the window.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~23"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~23"><i>pathName
    </i><b>xview moveto</b><i> fraction</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Adjusts the view in the window so that the character <i>fraction</i> of
      the way through the text appears at the left edge of the window.
      <i>Fraction</i> must be a fraction between 0 and 1.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~24"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~24"><i>pathName
    </i><b>xview scroll </b><i>number what</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This command shifts the view in the window left or right according to
      <i>number</i> and <i>what</i>. <i>Number</i> must be an integer.
      <i>What</i> must be either <b>units</b> or <b>pages</b> or an abbreviation
      of one of these. If <i>what</i> is <b>units</b>, the view adjusts left or
      right by <i>number</i> average-width characters on the display; if it is
      <b>pages</b> then the view adjusts by <i>number</i> screenfuls. If
      <i>number</i> is negative then characters farther to the left become
      visible; if it is positive then characters farther to the right become
      visible.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DEFAULT_BINDINGS"><a class="permalink" href="#DEFAULT_BINDINGS">DEFAULT
  BINDINGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Tk automatically creates class bindings for entries that give them
    the following default behavior. In the descriptions below,
    &#x201C;word&#x201D; refers to a contiguous group of letters, digits, or
    &#x201C;_&#x201D; characters, or any single character other than these.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>Clicking mouse button 1 positions the insertion cursor just before the
      character underneath the mouse cursor, sets the input focus to this
      widget, and clears any selection in the widget. Dragging with mouse button
      1 strokes out a selection between the insertion cursor and the character
      under the mouse.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>Double-clicking with mouse button 1 selects the word under the mouse and
      positions the insertion cursor at the end of the word. Dragging after a
      double click will stroke out a selection consisting of whole words.</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>Triple-clicking with mouse button 1 selects all of the text in the entry
      and positions the insertion cursor at the end of the line.</dd>
  <dt>[4]</dt>
  <dd>The ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging with mouse button 1
      while the Shift key is down; this will adjust the end of the selection
      that was nearest to the mouse cursor when button 1 was pressed. If the
      button is double-clicked before dragging then the selection will be
      adjusted in units of whole words.</dd>
  <dt>[5]</dt>
  <dd>Clicking mouse button 1 with the Control key down will position the
      insertion cursor in the entry without affecting the selection.</dd>
  <dt>[6]</dt>
  <dd>If any normal printing characters are typed in an entry, they are inserted
      at the point of the insertion cursor.</dd>
  <dt>[7]</dt>
  <dd>The view in the entry can be adjusted by dragging with mouse button 2. If
      mouse button 2 is clicked without moving the mouse, the selection is
      copied into the entry at the position of the mouse cursor.</dd>
  <dt>[8]</dt>
  <dd>If the mouse is dragged out of the entry on the left or right sides while
      button 1 is pressed, the entry will automatically scroll to make more text
      visible (if there is more text off-screen on the side where the mouse left
      the window).</dd>
  <dt>[9]</dt>
  <dd>The Left and Right keys move the insertion cursor one character to the
      left or right; they also clear any selection in the entry and set the
      selection anchor. If Left or Right is typed with the Shift key down, then
      the insertion cursor moves and the selection is extended to include the
      new character. Control-Left and Control-Right move the insertion cursor by
      words, and Control-Shift-Left and Control-Shift-Right move the insertion
      cursor by words and also extend the selection. Control-b and Control-f
      behave the same as Left and Right, respectively. Meta-b and Meta-f behave
      the same as Control-Left and Control-Right, respectively.</dd>
  <dt>[10]</dt>
  <dd>The Home key, or Control-a, will move the insertion cursor to the
      beginning of the entry and clear any selection in the entry. Shift-Home
      moves the insertion cursor to the beginning of the entry and also extends
      the selection to that point.</dd>
  <dt>[11]</dt>
  <dd>The End key, or Control-e, will move the insertion cursor to the end of
      the entry and clear any selection in the entry. Shift-End moves the cursor
      to the end and extends the selection to that point.</dd>
  <dt>[12]</dt>
  <dd>The Select key and Control-Space set the selection anchor to the position
      of the insertion cursor. They do not affect the current selection.
      Shift-Select and Control-Shift-Space adjust the selection to the current
      position of the insertion cursor, selecting from the anchor to the
      insertion cursor if there was not any selection previously.</dd>
  <dt>[13]</dt>
  <dd>Control-/ selects all the text in the entry.</dd>
  <dt>[14]</dt>
  <dd>Control-\ clears any selection in the entry.</dd>
  <dt>[15]</dt>
  <dd>The F16 key (labelled Copy on many Sun workstations) or Meta-w copies the
      selection in the widget to the clipboard, if there is a selection.</dd>
  <dt>[16]</dt>
  <dd>The F20 key (labelled Cut on many Sun workstations) or Control-w copies
      the selection in the widget to the clipboard and deletes the selection. If
      there is no selection in the widget then these keys have no effect.</dd>
  <dt>[17]</dt>
  <dd>The F18 key (labelled Paste on many Sun workstations) or Control-y inserts
      the contents of the clipboard at the position of the insertion
    cursor.</dd>
  <dt>[18]</dt>
  <dd>The Delete key deletes the selection, if there is one in the entry. If
      there is no selection, it deletes the character to the right of the
      insertion cursor.</dd>
  <dt>[19]</dt>
  <dd>The BackSpace key and Control-h delete the selection, if there is one in
      the entry. If there is no selection, it deletes the character to the left
      of the insertion cursor.</dd>
  <dt>[20]</dt>
  <dd>Control-d deletes the character to the right of the insertion cursor.</dd>
  <dt>[21]</dt>
  <dd>Meta-d deletes the word to the right of the insertion cursor.</dd>
  <dt>[22]</dt>
  <dd>Control-k deletes all the characters to the right of the insertion
    cursor.</dd>
  <dt>[23]</dt>
  <dd>Control-t reverses the order of the two characters to the right of the
      insertion cursor.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If the entry is disabled using the <b>-state</b> option, then the
    entry's view can still be adjusted and text in the entry can still be
    selected, but no insertion cursor will be displayed and no text
    modifications will take place except if the entry is linked to a variable
    using the <b>-textvariable</b> option, in which case any changes to the
    variable are reflected by the entry whatever the value of its <b>-state</b>
    option.</p>
<p class="Pp">The behavior of entries can be changed by defining new bindings
    for individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.</p>
