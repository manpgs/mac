   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">This command arranges for <i>cmd</i> (and <i>arg</i>s) to be
    executed in the application named by <i>app</i>. It returns the result or
    error from that command execution. <i>App</i> may be the name of any
    application whose main window is on the display containing the sender's main
    window; it need not be within the same process. If no <i>arg</i> arguments
    are present, then the command to be executed is contained entirely within
    the <i>cmd</i> argument. If one or more <i>arg</i>s are present, they are
    concatenated to form the command to be executed, just as for the <b>eval</b>
    command.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the initial arguments of the command begin with
    &#x201C;-&#x201D; they are treated as options. The following options are
    currently defined:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="async"><a class="permalink" href="#async"><b>-async</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Requests asynchronous invocation. In this case the <b>send</b> command
      will complete immediately without waiting for <i>cmd</i> to complete in
      the target application; no result will be available and errors in the sent
      command will be ignored. If the target application is in the same process
      as the sending application then the <b>-async</b> option is ignored.</dd>
  <dt id="displayof"><a class="permalink" href="#displayof"><b>-displayof</b>
    <i>pathName</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies that the target application's main window is on the display of
      the window given by <i>pathName</i>, instead of the display containing the
      application's main window.</dd>
  <dt><b>--</b></dt>
  <dd>Serves no purpose except to terminate the list of options. This option is
      needed only if <i>app</i> could contain a leading &#x201C;-&#x201D;
      character.

  NAMES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The name of an application is set initially from the name of the
    program or script that created the application. You can query and change the
    name of an application with the <b>tk appname</b> command.</p>

<p class="Pp">If the <b>send</b> command is removed from an application (e.g.
    with the command <b>rename send {}</b>) then the application will not
    respond to incoming send requests anymore, nor will it be able to issue
    outgoing requests. Communication can be reenabled by invoking the <b>tk
    appname</b> command.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SECURITY"><a class="permalink" href="#SECURITY">SECURITY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>send</b> command is potentially a serious security
    loophole. On Unix, any application that can connect to your X server can
    send scripts to your applications. These incoming scripts can use Tcl to
    read and write your files and invoke subprocesses under your name.
    Host-based access control such as that provided by <b>xhost</b> is
    particularly insecure, since it allows anyone with an account on particular
    hosts to connect to your server, and if disabled it allows anyone anywhere
    to connect to your server. In order to provide at least a small amount of
    security, Tk checks the access control being used by the server and rejects
    incoming sends unless (a) <b>xhost</b>-style access control is enabled (i.e.
    only certain hosts can establish connections) and (b) the list of enabled
    hosts is empty. This means that applications cannot connect to your server
    unless they use some other form of authorization such as that provide by
    <b>xauth</b>. Under Windows, <b>send</b> is currently disabled. Most of the
    functionality is provided by the <b>dde</b> command instead.</p>
