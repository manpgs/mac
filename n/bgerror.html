   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">Release 8.5 of Tcl supports the <b>interp bgerror</b> command,
    which allows applications to register in an interpreter the command that
    will handle background errors in that interpreter. In older releases of Tcl,
    this level of control was not available, and applications could control the
    handling of background errors only by creating a command with the particular
    command name <b>bgerror</b> in the global namespace of an interpreter. The
    following documentation describes the interface requirements of the
    <b>bgerror</b> command an application might define to retain compatibility
    with pre-8.5 releases of Tcl. Applications intending to support only Tcl
    releases 8.5 and later should simply make use of <b>interp bgerror</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>bgerror</b> command does not exist as built-in part of Tcl.
    Instead, individual applications or users can define a <b>bgerror</b>
    command (e.g. as a Tcl procedure) if they wish to handle background
  errors.</p>
<p class="Pp">A background error is one that occurs in an event handler or some
    other command that did not originate with the application. For example, if
    an error occurs while executing a command specified with the <b>after</b>
    command, then it is a background error. For a non-background error, the
    error can simply be returned up through nested Tcl command evaluations until
    it reaches the top-level code in the application; then the application can
    report the error in whatever way it wishes. When a background error occurs,
    the unwinding ends in the Tcl library and there is no obvious way for Tcl to
    report the error.</p>
<p class="Pp">When Tcl detects a background error, it saves information about
    the error and invokes a handler command registered by <b>interp bgerror</b>
    later as an idle event handler. The default handler command in turn calls
    the <b>bgerror</b> command . Before invoking <b>bgerror</b>, Tcl restores
    the <b>errorInfo</b> and <b>errorCode</b> variables to their values at the
    time the error occurred, then it invokes <b>bgerror</b> with the error
    message as its only argument. Tcl assumes that the application has
    implemented the <b>bgerror</b> command, and that the command will report the
    error in a way that makes sense for the application. Tcl will ignore any
    result returned by the <b>bgerror</b> command as long as no error is
    generated.</p>
<p class="Pp">If another Tcl error occurs within the <b>bgerror</b> command (for
    example, because no <b>bgerror</b> command has been defined) then Tcl
    reports the error itself by writing a message to stderr.</p>
<p class="Pp">If several background errors accumulate before <b>bgerror</b> is
    invoked to process them, <b>bgerror</b> will be invoked once for each error,
    in the order they occurred. However, if <b>bgerror</b> returns with a break
    exception, then any remaining errors are skipped without calling
    <b>bgerror</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are writing code that will be used by others as part of a
    package or other kind of library, consider avoiding <b>bgerror</b>. The
    reason for this is that the application programmer may also want to define a
    <b>bgerror</b>, or use other code that does and thus will have trouble
    integrating your code.</p>
