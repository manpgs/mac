   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">Tcl includes a library of Tcl procedures for commonly-needed
    functions. The procedures defined in the Tcl library are generic ones
    suitable for use by many different applications. The location of the Tcl
    library is returned by the <b>info library</b> command. In addition to the
    Tcl library, each application will normally have its own library of support
    procedures as well; the location of this library is normally given by the
    value of the <b>$</b><i>app</i><b>_library</b> global variable, where
    <i>app</i> is the name of the application. For example, the location of the
    Tk library is kept in the variable <b>$tk_library</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">To access the procedures in the Tcl library, an application should
    source the file <b>init.tcl</b> in the library, for example with the Tcl
    command</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>source [file join [info library] init.tcl]</b>
</pre>
</div>
If the library procedure <b>Tcl_Init</b> is invoked from an application's
  <b>Tcl_AppInit</b> procedure, this happens automatically. The code in
  <b>init.tcl</b> will define the <b>unknown</b> procedure and arrange for the
  other procedures to be loaded on-demand using the auto-load mechanism defined
  below.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMAND_PROCEDURES"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMAND_PROCEDURES">COMMAND
  PROCEDURES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The following procedures are provided in the Tcl library:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="auto_execok"><a class="permalink" href="#auto_execok"><b>auto_execok
    </b><i>cmd</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Determines whether there is an executable file or shell builtin by the
      name <i>cmd</i>. If so, it returns a list of arguments to be passed to
      <b>exec</b> to execute the executable file or shell builtin named by
      <i>cmd</i>. If not, it returns an empty string. This command examines the
      directories in the current search path (given by the PATH environment
      variable) in its search for an executable file named <i>cmd</i>. On
      Windows platforms, the search is expanded with the same directories and
      file extensions as used by <b>exec</b>. <b>Auto_execok</b> remembers
      information about previous searches in an array named <b>auto_execs</b>;
      this avoids the path search in future calls for the same <i>cmd</i>. The
      command <b>auto_reset</b> may be used to force <b>auto_execok</b> to
      forget its cached information.</dd>
  <dt id="auto_import"><a class="permalink" href="#auto_import"><b>auto_import
    </b><i>pattern</i></a></dt>
  <dd><b>Auto_import</b> is invoked during <b>namespace import</b> to see if the
      imported commands specified by <i>pattern</i> reside in an autoloaded
      library. If so, the commands are loaded so that they will be available to
      the interpreter for creating the import links. If the commands do not
      reside in an autoloaded library, <b>auto_import</b> does nothing. The
      pattern matching is performed according to the matching rules of
      <b>namespace import</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="auto_load"><a class="permalink" href="#auto_load"><b>auto_load
    </b><i>cmd</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This command attempts to load the definition for a Tcl command named
      <i>cmd</i>. To do this, it searches an <i>auto-load path</i>, which is a
      list of one or more directories. The auto-load path is given by the global
      variable <b>$auto_path</b> if it exists. If there is no <b>$auto_path</b>
      variable, then the TCLLIBPATH environment variable is used, if it exists.
      Otherwise the auto-load path consists of just the Tcl library directory.
      Within each directory in the auto-load path there must be a file
      <b>tclIndex</b> that describes one or more commands defined in that
      directory and a script to evaluate to load each of the commands. The
      <b>tclIndex</b> file should be generated with the <b>auto_mkindex</b>
      command. If <i>cmd</i> is found in an index file, then the appropriate
      script is evaluated to create the command. The <b>auto_load</b> command
      returns 1 if <i>cmd</i> was successfully created. The command returns 0 if
      there was no index entry for <i>cmd</i> or if the script did not actually
      define <i>cmd</i> (e.g. because index information is out of date). If an
      error occurs while processing the script, then that error is returned.
      <b>Auto_load</b> only reads the index information once and saves it in the
      array <b>auto_index</b>; future calls to <b>auto_load</b> check for
      <i>cmd</i> in the array rather than re-reading the index files. The cached
      index information may be deleted with the command <b>auto_reset</b>. This
      will force the next <b>auto_load</b> command to reload the index database
      from disk.</dd>
  <dt id="auto_mkindex"><a class="permalink" href="#auto_mkindex"><b>auto_mkindex
    </b><i>dir pattern pattern ...</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Generates an index suitable for use by <b>auto_load</b>. The command
      searches <i>dir</i> for all files whose names match any of the
      <i>pattern</i> arguments (matching is done with the <b>glob</b> command),
      generates an index of all the Tcl command procedures defined in all the
      matching files, and stores the index information in a file named
      <b>tclIndex</b> in <i>dir</i>. If no pattern is given a pattern of
      <b>*.tcl</b> will be assumed. For example, the command</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>auto_mkindex foo *.tcl</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">will read all the <b>.tcl</b> files in subdirectory <b>foo</b> and
    generate a new index file <b>foo/tclIndex</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Auto_mkindex</b> parses the Tcl scripts by sourcing them into a
    slave interpreter and monitoring the proc and namespace commands that are
    executed. Extensions can use the (undocumented) auto_mkindex_parser package
    to register other commands that can contribute to the auto_load index. You
    will have to read through auto.tcl to see how this works.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Auto_mkindex_old</b> parses the Tcl scripts in a relatively
    unsophisticated way: if any line contains the word <b>proc</b> as its first
    characters then it is assumed to be a procedure definition and the next word
    of the line is taken as the procedure's name. Procedure definitions that do
    not appear in this way (e.g. they have spaces before the <b>proc</b>) will
    not be indexed. If your script contains &#x201C;dangerous&#x201D; code, such
    as global initialization code or procedure names with special characters
    like <b>$</b>, <b>*</b>, <b>[</b> or <b>]</b>, you are safer using
    auto_mkindex_old.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="auto_reset"><a class="permalink" href="#auto_reset"><b>auto_reset</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Destroys all the information cached by <b>auto_execok</b> and
      <b>auto_load</b>. This information will be re-read from disk the next time
      it is needed. <b>Auto_reset</b> also deletes any procedures listed in the
      auto-load index, so that fresh copies of them will be loaded the next time
      that they are used.</dd>
  <dt id="auto_qualify"><a class="permalink" href="#auto_qualify"><b>auto_qualify
    </b><i>command namespace</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Computes a list of fully qualified names for <i>command</i>. This list
      mirrors the path a standard Tcl interpreter follows for command lookups:
      first it looks for the command in the current namespace, and then in the
      global namespace. Accordingly, if <i>command</i> is relative and
      <i>namespace</i> is not <b>::</b>, the list returned has two elements:
      <i>command</i> scoped by <i>namespace</i>, as if it were a command in the
      <i>namespace</i> namespace; and <i>command</i> as if it were a command in
      the global namespace. Otherwise, if either <i>command</i> is absolute (it
      begins with <b>::</b>), or <i>namespace</i> is <b>::</b>, the list
      contains only <i>command</i> as if it were a command in the global
      namespace.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><b>Auto_qualify</b> is used by the auto-loading facilities in Tcl,
    both for producing auto-loading indexes such as <i>pkgIndex.tcl</i>, and for
    performing the actual auto-loading of functions at runtime.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="tcl_findLibrary"><a class="permalink" href="#tcl_findLibrary"><b>tcl_findLibrary
    </b><i>basename version patch initScript enVarName varName</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This is a standard search procedure for use by extensions during their
      initialization. They call this procedure to look for their script library
      in several standard directories. The last component of the name of the
      library directory is normally <i>basenameversion</i> (e.g., tk8.0), but it
      might be &#x201C;library&#x201D; when in the build hierarchies. The
      <i>initScript</i> file will be sourced into the interpreter once it is
      found. The directory in which this file is found is stored into the global
      variable <i>varName</i>. If this variable is already defined (e.g., by C
      code during application initialization) then no searching is done.
      Otherwise the search looks in these directories: the directory named by
      the environment variable <i>enVarName</i>; relative to the Tcl library
      directory; relative to the executable file in the standard installation
      bin or bin/<i>arch</i> directory; relative to the executable file in the
      current build tree; relative to the executable file in a parallel build
      tree.</dd>
  <dt id="parray"><a class="permalink" href="#parray"><b>parray
    </b><i>arrayName</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Prints on standard output the names and values of all the elements in the
      array <i>arrayName</i>. <b>ArrayName</b> must be an array accessible to
      the caller of <b>parray</b>. It may be either local or global.</dd>
  <dt id="tcl_endOfWord"><a class="permalink" href="#tcl_endOfWord"><b>tcl_endOfWord
    </b><i>str start</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the index of the first end-of-word location that occurs after a
      starting index <i>start</i> in the string <i>str</i>. An end-of-word
      location is defined to be the first non-word character following the first
      word character after the starting point. Returns -1 if there are no more
      end-of-word locations after the starting point. See the description of
      <b>tcl_wordchars</b> and <b>tcl_nonwordchars</b> below for more details on
      how Tcl determines which characters are word characters.</dd>
  <dt id="tcl_startOfNextWord"><a class="permalink" href="#tcl_startOfNextWord"><b>tcl_startOfNextWord
    </b><i>str start</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the index of the first start-of-word location that occurs after a
      starting index <i>start</i> in the string <i>str</i>. A start-of-word
      location is defined to be the first word character following a non-word
      character. Returns -1 if there are no more start-of-word locations after
      the starting point.</dd>

  <dd>Returns the index of the first word boundary after the starting index
      <i>start</i> in the string <i>str</i>. Returns -1 if there are no more
      boundaries after the starting point in the given string. The index
      returned refers to the second character of the pair that comprises a
