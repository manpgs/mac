   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">This manual entry describes the common configuration options
    supported by widgets in the Tk toolkit. Every widget does not necessarily
    support every option (see the manual entries for individual widgets for a
    list of the standard options supported by that widget), but if a widget does
    support an option with one of the names listed below, then the option has
    exactly the effect described below.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the descriptions below, &#x201C;Command-Line Name&#x201D;
    refers to the switch used in class commands and <b>configure</b> widget
    commands to set this value. For example, if an option's command-line switch
    is <b>-foreground</b> and there exists a widget <b>.a.b.c</b>, then the
    command</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>.a.b.c&#x00A0;&#x00A0;configure&#x00A0;&#x00A0;-foreground black</b>
</pre>
</div>
may be used to specify the value <b>black</b> for the option in the widget
  <b>.a.b.c</b>. Command-line switches may be abbreviated, as long as the
  abbreviation is unambiguous. &#x201C;Database Name&#x201D; refers to the
  option's name in the option database (e.g. in .Xdefaults files).
  &#x201C;Database Class&#x201D; refers to the option's class value in the
  option database. [<span class="Op"><b>-activebackground</b>
  <i>activeBackground</i>]</span> Specifies background color to use when drawing
  active elements. An element (a widget or portion of a widget) is active if the
  mouse cursor is positioned over the element and pressing a mouse button will
  cause some action to occur. If strict Motif compliance has been requested by
  setting the <b>tk_strictMotif</b> variable, this option will normally be
  ignored; the normal background color will be used instead. For some elements
  on Windows and Macintosh systems, the active color will only be used while
  mouse button 1 is pressed over the element.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-activeborderwidth</b> <i>activeBorderWidth</i>]</span>
  Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of the 3-D border drawn
  around active elements. See above for definition of active elements. The value
  may have any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>. This option is
  typically only available in widgets displaying more than one element at a time
  (e.g. menus but not buttons). [<span class="Op"><b>-activeforeground</b>
  <i>activeForeground</i>]</span> Specifies foreground color to use when drawing
  active elements. See above for definition of active elements.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-anchor</b> <i>anchor</i>]</span> Specifies how the
  information in a widget (e.g. text or a bitmap) is to be displayed in the
  widget. Must be one of the values <b>n</b>, <b>ne</b>, <b>e</b>, <b>se</b>,
  <b>s</b>, <b>sw</b>, <b>w</b>, <b>nw</b>, or <b>center</b>. For example,
  <b>nw</b> means display the information such that its top-left corner is at
  the top-left corner of the widget. [<span class="Op"><b>-background or -bg</b>
  <i>background</i>]</span> Specifies the normal background color to use when
  displaying the widget. [<span class="Op"><b>-bitmap</b> <i>bitmap</i>]</span>
  Specifies a bitmap to display in the widget, in any of the forms acceptable to
  <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>. The exact way in which the bitmap is displayed may be
  affected by other options such as <b>anchor</b> or <b>justify</b>. Typically,
  if this option is specified then it overrides other options that specify a
  textual value to display in the widget but this is controlled by the
  <b>compound</b> option; the <b>bitmap</b> option may be reset to an empty
  string to re-enable a text display. In widgets that support both <b>bitmap</b>
  and <b>image</b> options, <b>image</b> will usually override <b>bitmap</b>.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-borderwidth or -bd</b> <i>borderWidth</i>]</span>
  Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of the 3-D border to draw
  around the outside of the widget (if such a border is being drawn; the
  <b>relief</b> option typically determines this). The value may also be used
  when drawing 3-D effects in the interior of the widget. The value may have any
  of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-cursor</b> <i>cursor</i>]</span> Specifies the mouse
  cursor to be used for the widget. The value may have any of the forms
  acceptable to <b>Tk_GetCursor</b>. In addition, if an empty string is
  specified, it indicates that the widget should defer to its parent for cursor
  specification. [<span class="Op"><b>-compound</b> <i>compound</i>]</span>
  Specifies if the widget should display text and bitmaps/images at the same
  time, and if so, where the bitmap/image should be placed relative to the text.
  Must be one of the values <b>none</b>, <b>bottom</b>, <b>top</b>, <b>left</b>,
  <b>right</b>, or <b>center</b>. For example, the (default) value <b>none</b>
  specifies that the bitmap or image should (if defined) be displayed instead of
  the text, the value <b>left</b> specifies that the bitmap or image should be
  displayed to the left of the text, and the value <b>center</b> specifies that
  the bitmap or image should be displayed on top of the text.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-disabledforeground</b> <i>disabledForeground</i>]</span>
  Specifies foreground color to use when drawing a disabled element. If the
  option is specified as an empty string (which is typically the case on
  monochrome displays), disabled elements are drawn with the normal foreground
  color but they are dimmed by drawing them with a stippled fill pattern.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-exportselection</b> <i>exportSelection</i>]</span>
  Specifies whether or not a selection in the widget should also be the X
  selection. The value may have any of the forms accepted by
  <b>Tcl_GetBoolean</b>, such as <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>, <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>,
  <b>yes</b>, or <b>no</b>. If the selection is exported, then selecting in the
  widget deselects the current X selection, selecting outside the widget
  deselects any widget selection, and the widget will respond to selection
  retrieval requests when it has a selection. The default is usually for widgets
  to export selections. [<span class="Op"><b>-font</b> <i>font</i>]</span>
  Specifies the font to use when drawing text inside the widget. The value may
  have any of the forms described in the <b>font</b> manual page under <b>FONT
  DESCRIPTION</b>. [<span class="Op"><b>-foreground or -fg</b>
  <i>foreground</i>]</span> Specifies the normal foreground color to use when
  displaying the widget. [<span class="Op"><b>-highlightbackground</b>
  <i>highlightBackground</i>]</span> Specifies the color to display in the
  traversal highlight region when the widget does not have the input focus.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-highlightcolor</b> <i>highlightColor</i>]</span>
  Specifies the color to use for the traversal highlight rectangle that is drawn
  around the widget when it has the input focus.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-highlightthickness</b> <i>highlightThickness</i>]</span>
  Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of the highlight rectangle
  to draw around the outside of the widget when it has the input focus. The
  value may have any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>. If the
  value is zero, no focus highlight is drawn around the widget.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-image</b> <i>image</i>]</span> Specifies an image to
  display in the widget, which must have been created with the <b>image
  create</b> command. Typically, if the <b>image</b> option is specified then it
  overrides other options that specify a bitmap or textual value to display in
  the widget, though this is controlled by the <b>compound</b> option; the
  <b>image</b> option may be reset to an empty string to re-enable a bitmap or
  text display. [<span class="Op"><b>-insertbackground</b>
  <i>insertBackground</i>]</span> Specifies the color to use as background in
  the area covered by the insertion cursor. This color will normally override
  either the normal background for the widget (or the selection background if
  the insertion cursor happens to fall in the selection).
  [<span class="Op"><b>-insertborderwidth</b> <i>insertBorderWidth</i>]</span>
  Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of the 3-D border to draw
  around the insertion cursor. The value may have any of the forms acceptable to
  <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>. [<span class="Op"><b>-insertofftime</b>
  <i>insertOffTime</i>]</span> Specifies a non-negative integer value indicating
  the number of milliseconds the insertion cursor should remain
  &#x201C;off&#x201D; in each blink cycle. If this option is zero then the
  cursor does not blink: it is on all the time.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-insertontime</b> <i>insertOnTime</i>]</span> Specifies a
  non-negative integer value indicating the number of milliseconds the insertion
  cursor should remain &#x201C;on&#x201D; in each blink cycle.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-insertwidth</b> <i>insertWidth</i>]</span> Specifies a
  value indicating the total width of the insertion cursor. The value may have
  any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>. If a border has been
  specified for the insertion cursor (using the <b>insertBorderWidth</b>
  option), the border will be drawn inside the width specified by the
  <b>insertWidth</b> option. [<span class="Op"><b>-jump</b> <i>jump</i>]</span>
  For widgets with a slider that can be dragged to adjust a value, such as
  scrollbars, this option determines when notifications are made about changes
  in the value. The option's value must be a boolean of the form accepted by
  <b>Tcl_GetBoolean</b>. If the value is false, updates are made continuously as
  the slider is dragged. If the value is true, updates are delayed until the
  mouse button is released to end the drag; at that point a single notification
  is made (the value &#x201C;jumps&#x201D; rather than changing smoothly).
  [<span class="Op"><b>-justify</b> <i>justify</i>]</span> When there are
  multiple lines of text displayed in a widget, this option determines how the
  lines line up with each other. Must be one of <b>left</b>, <b>center</b>, or
  <b>right</b>. <b>Left</b> means that the lines' left edges all line up,
  <b>center</b> means that the lines' centers are aligned, and <b>right</b>
  means that the lines' right edges line up. [<span class="Op"><b>-orient</b>
  <i>orient</i>]</span> For widgets that can lay themselves out with either a
  horizontal or vertical orientation, such as scrollbars, this option specifies
  which orientation should be used. Must be either <b>horizontal</b> or
  <b>vertical</b> or an abbreviation of one of these.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-padx</b> <i>padX</i>]</span> Specifies a non-negative
  value indicating how much extra space to request for the widget in the
  X-direction. The value may have any of the forms acceptable to
  <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>. When computing how large a window it needs, the widget
  will add this amount to the width it would normally need (as determined by the
  width of the things displayed in the widget); if the geometry manager can
  satisfy this request, the widget will end up with extra internal space to the
  left and/or right of what it displays inside. Most widgets only use this
  option for padding text: if they are displaying a bitmap or image, then they
  usually ignore padding options. [<span class="Op"><b>-pady</b>
  <i>padY</i>]</span> Specifies a non-negative value indicating how much extra
  space to request for the widget in the Y-direction. The value may have any of
  the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>. When computing how large a window
  it needs, the widget will add this amount to the height it would normally need
  (as determined by the height of the things displayed in the widget); if the
  geometry manager can satisfy this request, the widget will end up with extra
  internal space above and/or below what it displays inside. Most widgets only
  use this option for padding text: if they are displaying a bitmap or image,
  then they usually ignore padding options. [<span class="Op"><b>-relief</b>
  <i>relief</i>]</span> Specifies the 3-D effect desired for the widget.
  Acceptable values are <b>raised</b>, <b>sunken</b>, <b>flat</b>, <b>ridge</b>,
  <b>solid</b>, and <b>groove</b>. The value indicates how the interior of the
  widget should appear relative to its exterior; for example, <b>raised</b>
  means the interior of the widget should appear to protrude from the screen,
  relative to the exterior of the widget. [<span class="Op"><b>-repeatdelay</b>
  <i>repeatDelay</i>]</span> Specifies the number of milliseconds a button or
  key must be held down before it begins to auto-repeat. Used, for example, on
  the up- and down-arrows in scrollbars.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-repeatinterval</b> <i>repeatInterval</i>]</span> Used in
  conjunction with <b>repeatDelay</b>: once auto-repeat begins, this option
  determines the number of milliseconds between auto-repeats.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-selectbackground</b> <i>selectBackground</i>]</span>
  Specifies the background color to use when displaying selected items.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-selectborderwidth</b> <i>selectBorderWidth</i>]</span>
  Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of the 3-D border to draw
  around selected items. The value may have any of the forms acceptable to
  <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>. [<span class="Op"><b>-selectforeground</b>
  <i>selectForeground</i>]</span> Specifies the foreground color to use when
  displaying selected items. [<span class="Op"><b>-setgrid</b>
  <i>setGrid</i>]</span> Specifies a boolean value that determines whether this
  widget controls the resizing grid for its top-level window. This option is
  typically used in text widgets, where the information in the widget has a
  natural size (the size of a character) and it makes sense for the window's
  dimensions to be integral numbers of these units. These natural window sizes
  form a grid. If the <b>setGrid</b> option is set to true then the widget will
  communicate with the window manager so that when the user interactively
  resizes the top-level window that contains the widget, the dimensions of the
  window will be displayed to the user in grid units and the window size will be
  constrained to integral numbers of grid units. See the section <b>GRIDDED
  GEOMETRY MANAGEMENT</b> in the <b>wm</b> manual entry for more details.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-takefocus</b> <i>takeFocus</i>]</span> Determines
  whether the window accepts the focus during keyboard traversal (e.g., Tab and
  Shift-Tab). Before setting the focus to a window, the traversal scripts
  consult the value of the <b>takeFocus</b> option. A value of <b>0</b> means
  that the window should be skipped entirely during keyboard traversal. <b>1</b>
  means that the window should receive the input focus as long as it is viewable
  (it and all of its ancestors are mapped). An empty value for the option means
  that the traversal scripts make the decision about whether or not to focus on
  the window: the current algorithm is to skip the window if it is disabled, if
  it has no key bindings, or if it is not viewable. If the value has any other
  form, then the traversal scripts take the value, append the name of the window
  to it (with a separator space), and evaluate the resulting string as a Tcl
  script. The script must return <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, or an empty string: a
  <b>0</b> or <b>1</b> value specifies whether the window will receive the input
  focus, and an empty string results in the default decision described above.
  Note: this interpretation of the option is defined entirely by the Tcl scripts
  that implement traversal: the widget implementations ignore the option
  entirely, so you can change its meaning if you redefine the keyboard traversal
  scripts. [<span class="Op"><b>-text</b> <i>text</i>]</span> Specifies a string
  to be displayed inside the widget. The way in which the string is displayed
  depends on the particular widget and may be determined by other options, such
  as <b>anchor</b> or <b>justify</b>. [<span class="Op"><b>-textvariable</b>
  <i>textVariable</i>]</span> Specifies the name of a variable. The value of the
  variable is a text string to be displayed inside the widget; if the variable
  value changes then the widget will automatically update itself to reflect the
  new value. The way in which the string is displayed in the widget depends on
  the particular widget and may be determined by other options, such as
  <b>anchor</b> or <b>justify</b>. [<span class="Op"><b>-troughcolor</b>
  <i>troughColor</i>]</span> Specifies the color to use for the rectangular
  trough areas in widgets such as scrollbars and scales. This option is ignored
  for scrollbars on Windows (native widget does not recognize this option).
  [<span class="Op"><b>-underline</b> <i>underline</i>]</span> Specifies the
  integer index of a character to underline in the widget. This option is used
  by the default bindings to implement keyboard traversal for menu buttons and
  menu entries. 0 corresponds to the first character of the text displayed in
  the widget, 1 to the next character, and so on.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-wraplength</b> <i>wrapLength</i>]</span> For widgets
  that can perform word-wrapping, this option specifies the maximum line length.
  Lines that would exceed this length are wrapped onto the next line, so that no
  line is longer than the specified length. The value may be specified in any of
  the standard forms for screen distances. If this value is less than or equal
  to 0 then no wrapping is done: lines will break only at newline characters in
  the text. [<span class="Op"><b>-xscrollcommand</b>
  <i>xScrollCommand</i>]</span> Specifies the prefix for a command used to
  communicate with horizontal scrollbars. When the view in the widget's window
  changes (or whenever anything else occurs that could change the display in a
  scrollbar, such as a change in the total size of the widget's contents), the
  widget will generate a Tcl command by concatenating the scroll command and two
  numbers. Each of the numbers is a fraction between 0 and 1, which indicates a
  position in the document. 0 indicates the beginning of the document, 1
  indicates the end, .333 indicates a position one third the way through the
  document, and so on. The first fraction indicates the first information in the
  document that is visible in the window, and the second fraction indicates the
  information just after the last portion that is visible. The command is then
  passed to the Tcl interpreter for execution. Typically the
  <b>xScrollCommand</b> option consists of the path name of a scrollbar widget
  followed by &#x201C;set&#x201D;, e.g. &#x201C;.x.scrollbar set&#x201D;: this
  will cause the scrollbar to be updated whenever the view in the window
  changes. If this option is not specified, then no command will be executed.
  [<span class="Op"><b>-yscrollcommand</b> <i>yScrollCommand</i>]</span>
  Specifies the prefix for a command used to communicate with vertical
  scrollbars. This option is treated in the same way as the
  <b>xScrollCommand</b> option, except that it is used for vertical scrollbars
  and is provided by widgets that support vertical scrolling. See the
  description of <b>xScrollCommand</b> for details on how this option is used.
