   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">[<span class="Op"><b>-command</b> <i>command</i>]</span> Specifies
    a Tcl command to associate with the button. This command is typically
    invoked when mouse button 1 is released over the button window. The button's
    global variable (<b>-variable</b> option) will be updated before the command
    is invoked. [<span class="Op"><b>-height</b> <i>height</i>]</span> Specifies
    a desired height for the button. If an image or bitmap is being displayed in
    the button then the value is in screen units (i.e. any of the forms
    acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>); for text it is in lines of text. If this
    option is not specified, the button's desired height is computed from the
    size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in it.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-indicatoron</b> <i>indicatorOn</i>]</span> Specifies
    whether or not the indicator should be drawn. Must be a proper boolean
    value. If false, the <b>relief</b> option is ignored and the widget's relief
    is always sunken if the widget is selected and raised otherwise.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-selectcolor</b> <i>selectColor</i>]</span> Specifies a
    background color to use when the button is selected. If <b>indicatorOn</b>
    is true then the color applies to the indicator. Under Windows, this color
    is used as the background for the indicator regardless of the select state.
    If <b>indicatorOn</b> is false, this color is used as the background for the
    entire widget, in place of <b>background</b> or <b>activeBackground</b>,
    whenever the widget is selected. If specified as an empty string then no
    special color is used for displaying when the widget is selected.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-offrelief</b> <i>offRelief</i>]</span> Specifies the
    relief for the checkbutton when the indicator is not drawn and the
    checkbutton is off. The default value is &#x201C;raised&#x201D;. By setting
    this option to &#x201C;flat&#x201D; and setting <b>-indicatoron</b> to false
    and <b>-overrelief</b> to &#x201C;raised&#x201D;, the effect is achieved of
    having a flat button that raises on mouse-over and which is depressed when
    activated. This is the behavior typically exhibited by the Align-Left,
    Align-Right, and Center radiobuttons on the toolbar of a word-processor, for
    example. [<span class="Op"><b>-overrelief</b> <i>overRelief</i>]</span>
    Specifies an alternative relief for the radiobutton, to be used when the
    mouse cursor is over the widget. This option can be used to make toolbar
    buttons, by configuring <b>-relief flat -overrelief</b> <b>raised</b>. If
    the value of this option is the empty string, then no alternative relief is
    used when the mouse cursor is over the radiobutton. The empty string is the
    default value. [<span class="Op"><b>-selectimage</b>
    <i>selectImage</i>]</span> Specifies an image to display (in place of the
    <b>image</b> option) when the radiobutton is selected. This option is
    ignored unless the <b>image</b> option has been specified.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-state</b> <i>state</i>]</span> Specifies one of three
    states for the radiobutton: <b>normal</b>, <b>active</b>, or
    <b>disabled</b>. In normal state the radiobutton is displayed using the
    <b>foreground</b> and <b>background</b> options. The active state is
    typically used when the pointer is over the radiobutton. In active state the
    radiobutton is displayed using the <b>activeForeground</b> and
    <b>activeBackground</b> options. Disabled state means that the radiobutton
    should be insensitive: the default bindings will refuse to activate the
    widget and will ignore mouse button presses. In this state the
    <b>disabledForeground</b> and <b>background</b> options determine how the
    radiobutton is displayed. [<span class="Op"><b>-tristateimage</b>
    <i>tristateImage</i>]</span> Specifies an image to display (in place of the
    <b>image</b> option) when the radiobutton is selected. This option is
    ignored unless the <b>image</b> option has been specified.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-tristatevalue</b> <i>tristateValue</i>]</span>
    Specifies the value that causes the radiobutton to display the multi-value
    selection, also known as the tri-state mode. Defaults to &#x201C;&#x201D;.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-value</b> <i>value</i>]</span> Specifies value to
    store in the button's associated variable whenever this button is selected.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-variable</b> <i>variable</i>]</span> Specifies name of
    global variable to set whenever this button is selected. Changes in this
    variable also cause the button to select or deselect itself. Defaults to the
    value <b>selectedButton</b>. [<span class="Op"><b>-width</b>
    <i>width</i>]</span> Specifies a desired width for the button. If an image
    or bitmap is being displayed in the button, the value is in screen units
    (i.e. any of the forms acceptable to <b>Tk_GetPixels</b>); for text it is in
    characters. If this option is not specified, the button's desired width is
    computed from the size of the image or bitmap or text being displayed in
  it.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <b>radiobutton</b> command creates a new window (given by the
    <i>pathName</i> argument) and makes it into a radiobutton widget. Additional
    options, described above, may be specified on the command line or in the
    option database to configure aspects of the radiobutton such as its colors,
    font, text, and initial relief. The <b>radiobutton</b> command returns its
    <i>pathName</i> argument. At the time this command is invoked, there must
    not exist a window named <i>pathName</i>, but <i>pathName</i>'s parent must
    exist.</p>
<p class="Pp">A radiobutton is a widget that displays a textual string, bitmap
    or image and a diamond or circle called an <i>indicator</i>. If text is
    displayed, it must all be in a single font, but it can occupy multiple lines
    on the screen (if it contains newlines or if wrapping occurs because of the
    <b>wrapLength</b> option) and one of the characters may optionally be
    underlined using the <b>underline</b> option. A radiobutton has all of the
    behavior of a simple button: it can display itself in either of three
    different ways, according to the <b>state</b> option; it can be made to
    appear raised, sunken, or flat; it can be made to flash; and it invokes a
    Tcl command whenever mouse button 1 is clicked over the check button.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, radiobuttons can be <i>selected</i>. If a radiobutton
    is selected, the indicator is normally drawn with a selected appearance, and
    a Tcl variable associated with the radiobutton is set to a particular value
    (normally 1). Under Unix, the indicator is drawn with a sunken relief and a
    special color. Under Windows, the indicator is drawn with a round mark
    inside. If the radiobutton is not selected, then the indicator is drawn with
    a deselected appearance, and the associated variable is set to a different
    value (typically 0). The indicator is drawn without a round mark inside.
    Typically, several radiobuttons share a single variable and the value of the
    variable indicates which radiobutton is to be selected. When a radiobutton
    is selected it sets the value of the variable to indicate that fact; each
    radiobutton also monitors the value of the variable and automatically
    selects and deselects itself when the variable's value changes. If the
    variable's value matches the <b>tristateValue</b>, then the radiobutton is
    drawn using the tri-state mode. This mode is used to indicate mixed or
    multiple values. (This is used when the radiobutton represents the state of
    multiple items.) By default the variable <b>selectedButton</b> is used; its
    contents give the name of the button that is selected, or the empty string
    if no button associated with that variable is selected. The name of the
    variable for a radiobutton, plus the variable to be stored into it, may be
    modified with options on the command line or in the option database.
    Configuration options may also be used to modify the way the indicator is
    displayed (or whether it is displayed at all). By default a radiobutton is
    configured to select itself on button clicks.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="WIDGET_COMMAND"><a class="permalink" href="#WIDGET_COMMAND">WIDGET
  COMMAND</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>radiobutton</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose
    name is <i>pathName</i>. This command may be used to invoke various
    operations on the widget. It has the following general form:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>pathName option </i>?<i>arg arg ...</i>?</pre>
</div>
<i>Option</i> and the <i>arg</i>s determine the exact behavior of the command.
  The following commands are possible for radiobutton widgets:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="pathName"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName"><i>pathName
    </i><b>cget</b> <i>option</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
      <i>option</i>. <i>Option</i> may have any of the values accepted by the
      <b>radiobutton</b> command.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~2"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~2"><i>pathName
    </i><b>configure</b> ?<i>option</i>? ?<i>value option value
    ...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no
      <i>option</i> is specified, returns a list describing all of the available
      options for <i>pathName</i> (see <b>Tk_ConfigureInfo</b> for information
      on the format of this list). If <i>option</i> is specified with no
      <i>value</i>, the command returns a list describing the one named option
      (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value
      returned if no <i>option</i> is specified). If one or more
      <i>option-value</i> pairs are specified, the command modifies the given
      widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the command
      returns an empty string. <i>Option</i> may have any of the values accepted
      by the <b>radiobutton</b> command.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~3"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~3"><i>pathName
    </i><b>deselect</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Deselects the radiobutton and sets the associated variable to an empty
      string. If this radiobutton was not currently selected, the command has no
      effect.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~4"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~4"><i>pathName
    </i><b>flash</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Flashes the radiobutton. This is accomplished by redisplaying the
      radiobutton several times, alternating between active and normal colors.
      At the end of the flash the radiobutton is left in the same normal/active
      state as when the command was invoked. This command is ignored if the
      radiobutton's state is <b>disabled</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~5"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~5"><i>pathName
    </i><b>invoke</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Does just what would have happened if the user invoked the radiobutton
      with the mouse: selects the button and invokes its associated Tcl command,
      if there is one. The return value is the return value from the Tcl
      command, or an empty string if there is no command associated with the
      radiobutton. This command is ignored if the radiobutton's state is
      <b>disabled</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~6"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~6"><i>pathName
    </i><b>select</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Selects the radiobutton and sets the associated variable to the value
      corresponding to this widget.</dd>
</dl>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BINDINGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BINDINGS">BINDINGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Tk automatically creates class bindings for radiobuttons that give
    them the following default behavior:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>On Unix systems, a radiobutton activates whenever the mouse passes over it
      and deactivates whenever the mouse leaves the radiobutton. On Mac and
      Windows systems, when mouse button 1 is pressed over a radiobutton, the
      button activates whenever the mouse pointer is inside the button, and
      deactivates whenever the mouse pointer leaves the button.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>When mouse button 1 is pressed over a radiobutton it is invoked (it
      becomes selected and the command associated with the button is invoked, if
      there is one).</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>When a radiobutton has the input focus, the space key causes the
      radiobutton to be invoked.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If the radiobutton's state is <b>disabled</b> then none of the
    above actions occur: the radiobutton is completely non-responsive.</p>
<p class="Pp">The behavior of radiobuttons can be changed by defining new
    bindings for individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.</p>
