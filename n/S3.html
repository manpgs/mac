   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">This package provides access to Amazon's Simple Storage Solution
    web service.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a quick summary, Amazon Simple Storage Solution provides a
    for-fee web service allowing the storage of arbitrary data as
    &quot;resources&quot; within &quot;buckets&quot; online. See
    <i>http://www.amazonaws.com/</i> for details on that system. Access to the
    service is via HTTP (SOAP or REST). Much of this documentation will not make
    sense if you're not familiar with the terms and functionality of the Amazon
    S3 service.</p>
<p class="Pp">This package provides services for reading and writing the data
    items via the REST interface. It also provides some higher-level operations.
    Other packages in the same distribution provide for even more
  functionality.</p>
<p class="Pp">Copyright 2006 Darren New. All Rights Reserved. NO WARRANTIES OF
    ANY TYPE ARE PROVIDED. COPYING OR USE INDEMNIFIES THE AUTHOR IN ALL WAYS.
    This software is licensed under essentially the same terms as Tcl. See
    LICENSE.txt for the terms.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ERROR_REPORTING"><a class="permalink" href="#ERROR_REPORTING">ERROR
  REPORTING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The error reporting from this package makes use of $errorCode to
    provide more details on what happened than simply throwing an error. Any
    error caught by the S3 package (and we try to catch them all) will return
    with an $errorCode being a list having at least three elements. In all
    cases, the first element will be &quot;S3&quot;. The second element will
    take on one of six values, with that element defining the value of the third
    and subsequent elements. S3::REST does not throw an error, but rather
    returns a dictionary with the keys &quot;error&quot;, &quot;errorInfo&quot;,
    and &quot;errorCode&quot; set. This allows for reliable background use. The
    possible second elements are these:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="usage"><a class="permalink" href="#usage">usage</a></dt>
  <dd>The usage of the package is incorrect. For example, a command has been
      invoked which requires the library to be configured before the library has
      been configured, or an invalid combination of options has been specified.
      The third element of $errorCode supplies the name of the parameter that
      was wrong. The fourth usually provides the arguments that were actually
      supplied to the throwing proc, unless the usage error isn't confined to a
      single proc.</dd>
  <dt id="local"><a class="permalink" href="#local">local</a></dt>
  <dd>Something happened on the local system which threw an error. For example,
      a request to upload or download a file was made and the file permissions
      denied that sort of access. The third element of $errorCode is the
      original $errorCode.</dd>
  <dt id="socket"><a class="permalink" href="#socket">socket</a></dt>
  <dd>Something happened with the socket. It closed prematurely, or some other
      condition of failure-to-communicate-with-Amazon was detected. The third
      element of $errorCode is the original $errorCode, or sometimes the message
      from fcopy, or ...?</dd>
  <dt id="remote"><a class="permalink" href="#remote">remote</a></dt>
  <dd>The Amazon web service returned an error code outside the 2xx range in the
      HTTP header. In other words, everything went as documented, except this
      particular case was documented not to work. The third element is the
      dictionary returned from <b>::S3::REST</b>. Note that S3::REST itself
      never throws this error, but just returns the dictionary. Most of the
      higher-level commands throw for convenience, unless an argument indicates
      they should not. If something is documented as &quot;not throwing an S3
      remote error&quot;, it means a status return is set rather than throwing
      an error if Amazon returns a non-2XX HTTP result code.</dd>
  <dt id="notyet"><a class="permalink" href="#notyet">notyet</a></dt>
  <dd>The user obeyed the documentation, but the author has not yet gotten
      around to implementing this feature. (Right now, only TLS support and
      sophisticated permissions fall into this category, as well as the S3::Acl
      command.)</dd>
  <dt id="xml"><a class="permalink" href="#xml">xml</a></dt>
  <dd>The service has returned invalid XML, or XML whose schema is unexpected.
      For the high-level commands that accept service XML as input for parsing,
      this may also be thrown.</dd>
</dl>

<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMANDS">COMMANDS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This package provides several separate levels of complexity.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The lowest level simply takes arguments to be sent to the service, sends
      them, retrieves the result, and provides it to the caller. <i>Note:</i>
      This layer allows both synchronous and event-driven processing. It depends
      on the MD5 and SHA1 and base64 packages from Tcllib (available at
      <i>http://tcllib.sourceforge.net/</i>). Note that <b>S3::Configure</b> is
      required for <b>S3::REST</b> to work due to the authentication portion, so
      we put that in the &quot;lowest level.&quot;</li>
  <li>The next layer parses the results of calls, allowing for functionality
      such as uploading only changed files, synchronizing directories, and so
      on. This layer depends on the <b>TclXML</b> package as well as the
      included <b>xsxp</b> package. These packages are package required when
      these more-sophisticated routines are called, so nothing breaks if they
      are not correctly installed.</li>
  <li>Also included is a separate program that uses the library. It provides
      code to parse $argv0 and $argv from the command line, allowing invocation
      as a tclkit, etc. (Not yet implmented.)</li>
  <li>Another separate program provides a GUI interface allowing drag-and-drop
      and other such functionality. (Not yet implemented.)</li>
  <li>Also built on this package is the OddJob program. It is a separate program
      designed to allow distribution of computational work units over Amazon's
      Elastic Compute Cloud web service.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The goal is to have at least the bottom-most layers implemented in
    pure Tcl using only that which comes from widely-available sources, such as
    Tcllib.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="LOW_LEVEL_COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#LOW_LEVEL_COMMANDS">LOW
  LEVEL COMMANDS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">These commands do not require any packages not listed above. They
    talk directly to the service, or they are utility or configuration routines.
    Note that the &quot;xsxp&quot; package was written to support this package,
    so it should be available wherever you got this package.</p>

  <dd>There is one command for configuration, and that is <b>S3::Configure</b>.
      If called with no arguments, it returns a dictionary of key/value pairs
      listing all current settings. If called with one argument, it returns the
      value of that single argument. If called with two or more arguments, it
      must be called with pairs of arguments, and it applies the changes in
      order. There is only one set of configuration information per interpreter.
    <p class="Pp">The following options are accepted:</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="reset"><a class="permalink" href="#reset"><b>-reset</b>
    <i>boolean</i></a></dt>
  <dd>By default, false. If true, any previous changes and any changes on the
      same call before the reset option will be returned to default values.</dd>
  <dt id="retries"><a class="permalink" href="#retries"><b>-retries</b>
    <i>integer</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Default value is 3. If Amazon returns a 500 error, a retry after an
      exponential backoff delay will be tried this many times before finally
      throwing the 500 error. This applies to each call to <b>S3::REST</b> from
      the higher-level commands, but not to <b>S3::REST</b> itself. That is,
      <b>S3::REST</b> will always return httpstatus 500 if that's what it
      receives. Functions like <b>S3::Put</b> will retry the PUT call, and will
      also retry the GET and HEAD calls used to do content comparison. Changing
      this to 0 will prevent retries and their associated delays. In addition,
      socket errors (i.e., errors whose errorCode starts with &quot;S3
      socket&quot;) will be similarly retried after backoffs.</dd>

  <dt id="secretaccesskey"><a class="permalink" href="#secretaccesskey"><b>-secretaccesskey</b>

  <dd>Each defaults to an empty string. These must be set before any calls are
      made. This is your S3 ID. Once you sign up for an account, go to
      <i>http://www.amazonaws.com/</i>, sign in, go to the &quot;Your Web
      Services Account&quot; button, pick &quot;AWS Access Identifiers&quot;,
      and your access key ID and secret access keys will be available. All
      <b>S3::REST</b> calls are authenticated. Blame Amazon for the poor choice
      of names.</dd>
  <dt id="service_access_point"><a class="permalink" href="#service_access_point"><b>-service-access-point</b>
    <i>FQDN</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Defaults to &quot;s3.amazonaws.com&quot;. This is the fully-qualified
      domain name of the server to contact for <b>S3::REST</b> calls. You should
      probably never need to touch this, unless someone else implements a
      compatible service, or you wish to test something by pointing the library
      at your own service.</dd>
  <dt id="slop_seconds"><a class="permalink" href="#slop_seconds"><b>-slop-seconds</b>
    <i>integer</i></a></dt>
  <dd>When comparing dates between Amazon and the local machine, two dates
      within this many seconds of each other are considered the same. Useful for
      clock drift correction, processing overhead time, and so on.</dd>
  <dt id="use_tls"><a class="permalink" href="#use_tls"><b>-use-tls</b>
    <i>boolean</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Defaults to false. This is not yet implemented. If true, <b>S3::REST</b>
      will negotiate a TLS connection to Amazon. If false, unencrypted
      connections are used.</dd>
  <dt id="bucket_prefix"><a class="permalink" href="#bucket_prefix"><b>-bucket-prefix</b>
    <i>string</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Defaults to &quot;TclS3&quot;. This string is used by
      <b>S3::SuggestBucketName</b> if that command is passed an empty string as
      an argument. It is used to distinguish different applications using the
      Amazon service. Your application should always set this to keep from
      interfering with the buckets of other users of Amazon S3 or with other
      buckets of the same user.</dd>
  <dt id="default_compare"><a class="permalink" href="#default_compare"><b>-default-compare</b>
    <i>always|never|exists|missing|newer|date|checksum|different</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Defaults to &quot;always.&quot; If no -compare is specified on
      <b>S3::Put</b>, <b>S3::Get</b>, or <b>S3::Delete</b>, this comparison is
      used. See those commands for a description of the meaning.</dd>
  <dt id="default_separator"><a class="permalink" href="#default_separator"><b>-default-separator</b>
    <i>string</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Defaults to &quot;/&quot;. This is currently unused. It might make sense
      to use this for <b>S3::Push</b> and <b>S3::Pull</b>, but allowing
      resources to have slashes in their names that aren't marking directories
      would be problematic. Hence, this currently does nothing.</dd>
  <dt id="default_acl"><a class="permalink" href="#default_acl"><b>-default-acl</b>
    <i>private|public-read|public-read-write|authenticated-read|keep|calc</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Defaults to an empty string. If no -acl argument is provided to
      <b>S3::Put</b> or <b>S3::Push</b>, this string is used (given as the
      x-amz-acl header if not keep or calc). If this is also empty, no x-amz-acl
      header is generated. This is <i>not</i> used by <b>S3::REST</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="default_bucket"><a class="permalink" href="#default_bucket"><b>-default-bucket</b>
    <i>bucketname</i></a></dt>
  <dd>If no bucket is given to <b>S3::GetBucket</b>, <b>S3::PutBucket</b>,
      <b>S3::Get</b>, <b>S3::Put</b>, <b>S3::Head</b>, <b>S3::Acl</b>,
      <b>S3::Delete</b>, <b>S3::Push</b>, <b>S3::Pull</b>, or <b>S3::Toss</b>,
      and if this configuration variable is not an empty string (and not simply
      &quot;/&quot;), then this value will be used for the bucket. This is
      useful if one program does a large amount of resource manipulation within
      a single bucket.</dd>

  <dd>The <b>S3::SuggestBucket</b> command accepts an optional string as a
      prefix and returns a valid bucket containing the <i>name</i> argument and
      the Access Key ID. This makes the name unique to the owner and to the
      application (assuming the application picks a good <i>name</i> argument).
      If no name is provided, the name from <b>S3::Configure</b>
      <i>-bucket-prefix</i> is used. If that too is empty (which is not the

    <i>dict</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>S3::REST</b> command takes as an argument a dictionary and returns
      a dictionary. The return dictionary has the same keys as the input
      dictionary, and includes additional keys as the result. The presence or
      absence of keys in the input dictionary can control the behavior of the
      routine. It never throws an error directly, but includes keys
      &quot;error&quot;, &quot;errorInfo&quot;, and &quot;errorCode&quot; if
      necessary. Some keys are required, some optional. The routine can run
      either in blocking or non-blocking mode, based on the presense of
      <b>resultvar</b> in the input dictionary. This requires the
      <i>-accesskeyid</i> and <i>-secretaccesskey</i> to be configured via
      <b>S3::Configure</b> before being called.

      values must not contain embedded newlines or carriage returns. This is
      primarily useful for adding x-amz-* headers. Since authentication is
      calculated by <b>S3::REST</b>, do not add that header here. Since
      content-type gets its own key, also do not add that header here.</dd>
  <dt>?<b>inbody</b> <i>contentstring</i>?</dt>
  <dd>This optional item, if provided, gives the content that will be sent. It
      is sent with a tranfer encoding of binary, and only the low bytes are
      used, so use [encoding convertto utf-8] if the string is a utf-8 string.
      This is written all in one blast, so if you are using non-blocking mode
      and the <b>inbody</b> is especially large, you may wind up blocking on the
      write socket.</dd>
  <dt>?<b>infile</b> <i>filename</i>?</dt>
  <dd>This optional item, if provided, and if <b>inbody</b> is not provided,
      names the file from which the body of the HTTP message will be
      constructed. The file is opened for reading and sent progressively by
      [fcopy], so it should not block in non-blocking mode even if the file is
      very large. The file is transfered in binary mode, so the bytes on your
      disk will match the bytes in your resource. Due to HTTP restrictions, it
      must be possible to use [file size] on this file to determine the size at
      the start of the transaction.</dd>
  <dt>?<b>S3chan</b> <i>channel</i>?</dt>
  <dd>This optional item, if provided, indicates the already-open socket over
      which the transaction should be conducted. If not provided, a connection
      is made to the service access point specified via <b>S3::Configure</b>,
      which is normally s3.amazonaws.com. If this is provided, the channel is
      not closed at the end of the transaction.</dd>
  <dt>?<b>outchan</b> <i>channel</i>?</dt>
  <dd>This optional item, if provided, indicates the already-open channel to
      which the body returned from S3 should be written. That is, to retrieve a
      large resource, open a file, set the translation mode, and pass the
      channel as the value of the key outchan. Output will be written to the
      channel in pieces so memory does not fill up unnecessarily. The channel is
      not closed at the end of the transaction.</dd>
  <dt>?<b>resultvar</b> <i>varname</i>?</dt>
  <dd>This optional item, if provided, indicates that <b>S3::REST</b> should run
      in non-blocking mode. The <i>varname</i> should be fully qualified with
      respect to namespaces and cannot be local to a proc. If provided, the
      result of the <b>S3::REST</b> call is assigned to this variable once
      everything has completed; use trace or vwait to know when this has
      happened. If this key is not provided, the result is simply returned from
      the call to <b>S3::REST</b> and no calls to the eventloop are invoked from
      within this call.</dd>
  <dt>?<b>throwsocket</b> <i>throw|return</i>?</dt>
  <dd>This optional item, if provided, indicates that <b>S3::REST</b> should
      throw an error if throwmode is throw and a socket error is encountered. It
      indicates that <b>S3::REST</b> should return the error code in the
      returned dictionary if a socket error is encountered and this is set to
      return. If <b>throwsocket</b> is set to <i>return</i> or if the call is
      not blocking, then a socket error (i.e., an error whose error code starts
      with &quot;S3 socket&quot; will be returned in the dictionary as
      <b>error</b>, <b>errorInfo</b>, and <b>errorCode</b>. If a foreground call
      is made (i.e., <b>resultvar</b> is not provided), and this option is not
      provided or is set to <i>throw</i>, then <b>error</b> will be invoked
      instead.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Once the call to <b>S3::REST</b> completes, a new dict is
    returned, either in the <i>resultvar</i> or as the result of execution. This
    dict is a copy of the original dict with the results added as new keys. The
    possible new keys are these:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

  <dt id="errorCode"><a class="permalink" href="#errorCode"><b>errorCode</b>
    <i>errorstring</i></a></dt>
  <dd>If an error is caught, these three keys will be set in the result. Note
      that <b>S3::REST</b> does <i>not</i> consider a non-2XX HTTP return code
      as an error. The <b>errorCode</b> value will be formatted according to the
      <b>ERROR REPORTING</b> description. If these are present, other keys
      described here might not be.</dd>
  <dt id="httpstatus"><a class="permalink" href="#httpstatus"><b>httpstatus</b>
    <i>threedigits</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The three-digit code from the HTTP transaction. 2XX for good, 5XX for

  <dt id="outbody"><a class="permalink" href="#outbody"><b>outbody</b>
    <i>contentstring</i></a></dt>
  <dd>If <i>outchan</i> was not specified, this key will hold a reference to the
      (unencoded) contents of the body returned. If Amazon returned an error (a
      la the httpstatus not a 2XX value), the error message will be in
      <b>outbody</b> or written to <b>outchan</b> as appropriate.</dd>
  <dt id="outheaders"><a class="permalink" href="#outheaders"><b>outheaders</b>
    <i>dict</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This contains a dictionary of headers returned by Amazon. The keys are
      always lower case. It's mainly useful for finding the x-amz-meta-*
      headers, if any, although things like last-modified and content-type are
      also useful. The keys of this dictionary are always lower case. Both keys
      and values are trimmed of extraneous whitespace.</dd>

  LEVEL COMMANDS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The routines in this section all make use of one or more calls to
    <b>S3::REST</b> to do their work, then parse and manage the data in a
    convenient way. All these commands throw errors as described in <b>ERROR
    REPORTING</b> unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p class="Pp">In all these commands, all arguments are presented as name/value
    pairs, in any order. All the argument names start with a hyphen.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are a few options that are common to many of the commands,
    and those common options are documented here.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="blocking"><a class="permalink" href="#blocking"><b>-blocking</b>
    <i>boolean</i></a></dt>
  <dd>If provided and specified as false, then any calls to <b>S3:REST</b> will
      be non-blocking, and internally these routines will call [vwait] to get
      the results. In other words, these routines will return the same value,
      but they'll have event loops running while waiting for Amazon.</dd>
  <dt id="parse_xml"><a class="permalink" href="#parse_xml"><b>-parse-xml</b>
    <i>xmlstring</i></a></dt>
  <dd>If provided, the routine skips actually communicating with Amazon, and
      instead behaves as if the XML string provided was returned as the body of
      the call. Since several of these routines allow the return of data in
      various formats, this argument can be used to parse existing XML to
      extract the bits of information that are needed. It's also helpful for
      testing.</dd>
  <dt id="bucket"><a class="permalink" href="#bucket"><b>-bucket</b>
    <i>bucketname</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Almost every high-level command needs to know what bucket the resources
      are in. This option specifies that. (Only the command to list available
      buckets does not require this parameter.) This does not need to be
      URL-encoded, even if it contains special or non-ASCII characters. May or
      may not contain leading or trailing spaces - commands normalize the
      bucket. If this is not supplied, the value is taken from <b>S3::Configure
      -default-bucket</b> if that string isn't empty. Note that spaces and
      slashes are always trimmed from both ends and the rest must leave a valid
      bucket.</dd>
  <dt id="resource~2"><a class="permalink" href="#resource~2"><b>-resource</b>
    <i>resourcename</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This specifies the resource of interest within the bucket. It may or may
      not start with a slash - both cases are handled. This does not need to be
      URL-encoded, even if it contains special or non-ASCII characters.</dd>
  <dt id="compare"><a class="permalink" href="#compare"><b>-compare</b>
    <i>always|never|exists|missing|newer|date|checksum|different</i></a></dt>
  <dd>When commands copy resources to files or files to resources, the caller
      may specify that the copy should be skipped if the contents are the same.
      This argument specifies the conditions under which the files should be
      copied. If it is not passed, the result of <b>S3::Configure
      -default-compare</b> is used, which in turn defaults to
      &quot;always.&quot; The meanings of the various values are these:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="always"><a class="permalink" href="#always"><i>always</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Always copy the data. This is the default.</dd>
  <dt id="never"><a class="permalink" href="#never"><i>never</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Never copy the data. This is essentially a no-op, except in
      <b>S3::Push</b> and <b>S3::Pull</b> where the -delete flag might make a
      difference.</dd>
  <dt id="exists"><a class="permalink" href="#exists"><i>exists</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Copy the data only if the destination already exists.</dd>
  <dt id="missing"><a class="permalink" href="#missing"><i>missing</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Copy the data only if the destination does not already exist.</dd>
  <dt id="newer"><a class="permalink" href="#newer"><i>newer</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Copy the data if the destination is missing, or if the date on the source
      is newer than the date on the destination by at least <b>S3::Configure
      -slop-seconds</b> seconds. If the source is Amazon, the date is taken from
      the Last-Modified header. If the source is local, it is taken as the mtime
      of the file. If the source data is specified in a string rather than a
      file, it is taken as right now, via [clock seconds].</dd>
  <dt id="date"><a class="permalink" href="#date"><i>date</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Like <i>newer</i>, except copy if the date is newer <i>or</i> older.</dd>
  <dt id="checksum"><a class="permalink" href="#checksum"><i>checksum</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Calculate the MD5 checksum on the local file or string, ask Amazon for the
      eTag of the resource, and copy the data if they're different. Copy the
      data also if the destination is missing. Note that this can be slow with
      large local files unless the C version of the MD5 support is
    available.</dd>
  <dt id="different"><a class="permalink" href="#different"><i>different</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Copy the data if the destination does not exist. If the destination exists
      and an actual file name was specified (rather than a content string), and
      the date on the file differs from the date on the resource, copy the data.
      If the data is provided as a content string, the &quot;date&quot; is
      treated as &quot;right now&quot;, so it will likely always differ unless
      slop-seconds is large. If the dates are the same, the MD5 checksums are
      compared, and the data is copied if the checksums differ.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that &quot;newer&quot; and &quot;date&quot; don't care about
    the contents, and &quot;checksum&quot; doesn't care about the dates, but
    &quot;different&quot; checks both.</p>

      additional argument, the common suffix as the second additional argument,
      and a third argument that will be &quot;copied&quot; (if <b>S3::Put</b>
      sent the resource), &quot;skipped&quot; (if <b>S3::Put</b> decided not to
      based on <b>-compare</b>), or the errorCode that <b>S3::Put</b> threw due
      to unexpected errors (in which case the third argument is a list that
      starts with &quot;S3&quot;). When all files have been transfered, the
      prefix may be invoked zero or more times with <i>delete</i> as the first
      additional argument and the suffix of the resource being deleted as the
      second additional argument, with a third argument being either an empty
      string (if the delete worked) or the errorCode from <b>S3::Delete</b> if
      it failed. Finally, the prefix will be invoked with <i>finished</i> as the
      first additional argument and the return value as the second additional
      argument.</dd>

The return result from this command is a dictionary. They keys are the suffixes
  (i.e., the common portion of the path after the <b>-directory</b> and
  <b>-prefix</b>), while the values are either &quot;copied&quot;,
  &quot;skipped&quot; (if <b>-compare</b> indicated not to copy the file), or
  the errorCode thrown by <b>S3::Put</b>, as appropriate. If <b>-delete</b> was
  true, there may also be entries for suffixes with the value
  &quot;deleted&quot; or &quot;notdeleted&quot;, indicating whether the
  attempted <b>S3::Delete</b> worked or not, respectively. There is one
  additional pair in the return result, whose key is the empty string and whose
  value is a nested dictionary. The keys of this nested dictionary include
  &quot;filescopied&quot; (the number of files successfully copied),
  &quot;bytescopied&quot; (the number of data bytes in the files copied,
  excluding headers, metadata, etc), &quot;compareskipped&quot; (the number of
  files not copied due to <b>-compare</b> mode), &quot;errorskipped&quot; (the
  number of files not copied due to thrown errors), &quot;filesdeleted&quot;
  (the number of resources deleted due to not having corresponding files
  locally, or 0 if <b>-delete</b> is false), and &quot;filesnotdeleted&quot;
  (the number of resources whose deletion was attempted but failed).
<p class="Pp">Note that this is currently implemented somewhat inefficiently. It
    fetches the bucket listing (including timestamps and eTags), then calls
    <b>S3::Put</b>, which uses HEAD to find the timestamps and eTags again.
    Correcting this with no API change is planned for a future upgrade.</p>

  <dd>This synchronises a remote bucket with a local directory by pulling the

      creates directories if needed; new directories are created with default
      permissions. Note that resource names are case sensitive, so changing the
      case of a file on a Windows machine may lead to otherwise-unnecessary
      transfers. Also, try not to store data in resources that end with a slash,
      or which are prefixes of resources that otherwise would start with a

<h1 class="Sh" id="LIMITATIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The pure-Tcl MD5 checking is slow. If you are processing files in the
      megabyte range, consider ensuring binary support is available.</li>
  <li>The commands <b>S3::Pull</b> and <b>S3::Push</b> fetch a directory listing
      which includes timestamps and MD5 hashes, then invoke <b>S3::Get</b> and
      <b>S3::Put</b>. If a complex <b>-compare</b> mode is specified,
      <b>S3::Get</b> and <b>S3::Put</b> will invoke a HEAD operation for each
      file to fetch timestamps and MD5 hashes of each resource again. It is
      expected that a future release of this package will solve this without any
      API changes.</li>
  <li>The commands <b>S3::Pull</b> and <b>S3::Push</b> fetch a directory listing
      without using <b>-max-count</b>. The entire directory is pulled into
      memory at once. For very large buckets, this could be a performance
      problem. The author, at this time, does not plan to change this behavior.
      Welcome to Open Source.</li>
  <li><b>S3::Sync</b> is neither designed nor implemented yet. The intention
      would be to keep changes synchronised, so changes could be made to both
      the bucket and the local directory and be merged by <b>S3::Sync</b>.</li>
  <li>Nor is <b>-compare</b> <i>calc</i> fully implemented. This is primarily
      due to Windows not providing a convenient method for distinguishing
      between local files that are &quot;public-read&quot; or
      &quot;public-read-write&quot;. Assistance figuring out TWAPI for this
      would be appreciated. The U**X semantics are difficult to map directly as
      well. See the source for details. Note that there are not tests for calc,
      since it isn't done yet.</li>
  <li>The HTTP processing is implemented within the library, rather than using a
      &quot;real&quot; HTTP package. Hence, multi-line headers are not (yet)
      handled correctly. Do not include carriage returns or linefeeds in
      x-amz-meta-* headers, content-type values, and so on. The author does not
      at this time expect to improve this.</li>
  <li>Internally, <b>S3::Push</b> and <b>S3::Pull</b> and <b>S3::Toss</b> are
      all very similar and should be refactored.</li>
  <li>The idea of using <b>-compare</b> <i>never</i> <b>-delete</b> <i>true</i>
      to delete files that have been deleted from one place but not the other
      yet not copying changed files is untested.</li>

  DEVELOPMENTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The author intends to work on several additional projects related
    to this package, in addition to finishing the unfinished features.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, a command-line program allowing browsing of buckets and
    transfer of files from shell scripts and command prompts is useful.</p>
<p class="Pp">Second, a GUI-based program allowing visual manipulation of bucket
    and resource trees not unlike Windows Explorer would be useful.</p>
<p class="Pp">Third, a command-line (and perhaps a GUI-based) program called
    &quot;OddJob&quot; that will use S3 to synchronize computation amongst
    multiple servers running OddJob. An S3 bucket will be set up with a number
    of scripts to run, and the OddJob program can be invoked on multiple
    machines to run scripts on all the machines, each moving on to the next
    unstarted task as it finishes each. This is still being designed, and it is
    intended primarily to be run on Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud.</p>
