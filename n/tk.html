   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">The <b>tk</b> command provides access to miscellaneous elements of
    Tk's internal state. Most of the information manipulated by this command
    pertains to the application as a whole, or to a screen or display, rather
    than to a particular window. The command can take any of a number of
    different forms depending on the <i>option</i> argument. The legal forms
    are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="tk"><a class="permalink" href="#tk"><b>tk appname
    </b>?<i>newName</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>If <i>newName</i> is not specified, this command returns the name of the
      application (the name that may be used in <b>send</b> commands to
      communicate with the application). If <i>newName</i> is specified, then
      the name of the application is changed to <i>newName</i>. If the given
      name is already in use, then a suffix of the form &#x201C;<b>
      #2</b>&#x201D; or &#x201C;<b> #3</b>&#x201D; is appended in order to make
      the name unique. The command's result is the name actually chosen.
      <i>newName</i> should not start with a capital letter. This will interfere
      with option processing, since names starting with capitals are assumed to
      be classes; as a result, Tk may not be able to find some options for the
      application. If sends have been disabled by deleting the <b>send</b>
      command, this command will reenable them and recreate the <b>send</b>
      command.</dd>
  <dt id="tk~2"><a class="permalink" href="#tk~2"><b>tk caret window </b>?<b>-x
    </b><i>x</i>? ?<b>-y </b><i>y</i>? ?<b>-height </b><i>height</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Sets and queries the caret location for the display of the specified Tk
      window <i>window</i>. The caret is the per-display cursor location used
      for indicating global focus (e.g. to comply with Microsoft Accessibility
      guidelines), as well as for location of the over-the-spot XIM (X Input
      Methods) or Windows IME windows. If no options are specified, the last
      values used for setting the caret are return in option-value pair format.
      <i>-x</i> and <i>-y</i> represent window-relative coordinates, and
      <i>-height</i> is the height of the current cursor location, or the height
      of the specified <i>window</i> if none is given.</dd>
  <dt id="tk~3"><a class="permalink" href="#tk~3"><b>tk scaling
    </b>?<b>-displayof </b><i>window</i>? ?<i>number</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Sets and queries the current scaling factor used by Tk to convert between
      physical units (for example, points, inches, or millimeters) and pixels.
      The <i>number</i> argument is a floating point number that specifies the
      number of pixels per point on <i>window</i>'s display. If the
      <i>window</i> argument is omitted, it defaults to the main window. If the
      <i>number</i> argument is omitted, the current value of the scaling factor
      is returned.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">A &#x201C;point&#x201D; is a unit of measurement equal to 1/72
    inch. A scaling factor of 1.0 corresponds to 1 pixel per point, which is
    equivalent to a standard 72 dpi monitor. A scaling factor of 1.25 would mean
    1.25 pixels per point, which is the setting for a 90 dpi monitor; setting
    the scaling factor to 1.25 on a 72 dpi monitor would cause everything in the
    application to be displayed 1.25 times as large as normal. The initial value
    for the scaling factor is set when the application starts, based on
    properties of the installed monitor, but it can be changed at any time.
    Measurements made after the scaling factor is changed will use the new
    scaling factor, but it is undefined whether existing widgets will resize
    themselves dynamically to accommodate the new scaling factor.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="tk~4"><a class="permalink" href="#tk~4"><b>tk inactive
    </b>?<b>-displayof </b><i>window</i>? ?<b>reset</b>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Returns a positive integer, the number of milliseconds since the last time
      the user interacted with the system. If the <b>-displayof</b> option is
      given then the return value refers to the display of <i>window</i>;
      otherwise it refers to the display of the application's main window.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><b>tk inactive</b> will return -1, if querying the user inactive
    time is not supported by the system, and in safe interpreters.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the literal string <b>reset</b> is given as an additional
    argument, the timer is reset and an empty string is returned. Resetting the
    inactivity time is forbidden in safe interpreters and will throw and error
    if tried.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="tk~5"><a class="permalink" href="#tk~5"><b>tk useinputmethods
    </b>?<b>-displayof </b><i>window</i>? ?<i>boolean</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Sets and queries the state of whether Tk should use XIM (X Input Methods)
      for filtering events. The resulting state is returned. XIM is used in some
      locales (i.e., Japanese, Korean), to handle special input devices. This
      feature is only significant on X. If XIM support is not available, this
      will always return 0. If the <i>window</i> argument is omitted, it
      defaults to the main window. If the <i>boolean</i> argument is omitted,
      the current state is returned. This is turned on by default for the main
      display.</dd>
  <dt id="tk~6"><a class="permalink" href="#tk~6"><b>tk
    windowingsystem</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the current Tk windowing system, one of <b>x11</b> (X11-based),
      <b>win32</b> (MS Windows), or <b>aqua</b> (Mac OS X Aqua).</dd>
