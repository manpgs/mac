   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">In the first form, the <b>read</b> command reads all of the data
    from <i>channelId</i> up to the end of the file. If the <b>-nonewline</b>
    switch is specified then the last character of the file is discarded if it
    is a newline. In the second form, the extra argument specifies how many
    characters to read. Exactly that many characters will be read and returned,
    unless there are fewer than <i>numChars</i> left in the file; in this case
    all the remaining characters are returned. If the channel is configured to
    use a multi-byte encoding, then the number of characters read may not be the
    same as the number of bytes read.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>ChannelId</i> must be an identifier for an open channel such as
    the Tcl standard input channel (<b>stdin</b>), the return value from an
    invocation of <b>open</b> or <b>socket</b>, or the result of a channel
    creation command provided by a Tcl extension. The channel must have been
    opened for input.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>channelId</i> is in nonblocking mode, the command may not
    read as many characters as requested: once all available input has been
    read, the command will return the data that is available rather than
    blocking for more input. If the channel is configured to use a multi-byte
    encoding, then there may actually be some bytes remaining in the internal
    buffers that do not form a complete character. These bytes will not be
    returned until a complete character is available or end-of-file is reached.
    The <b>-nonewline</b> switch is ignored if the command returns before
    reaching the end of the file.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Read</b> translates end-of-line sequences in the input into
    newline characters according to the <b>-translation</b> option for the
    channel. See the <b>fconfigure</b> manual entry for a discussion on ways in
    which <b>fconfigure</b> will alter input.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="USE_WITH_SERIAL_PORTS"><a class="permalink" href="#USE_WITH_SERIAL_PORTS">USE
  WITH SERIAL PORTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">For most applications a channel connected to a serial port should
    be configured to be nonblocking: <b>fconfigure </b><i>channelId
    </i><b>-blocking</b> <b></b><i>0</i>. Then <b>read</b> behaves much like
    described above. Care must be taken when using <b>read</b> on blocking
    serial ports:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="read"><a class="permalink" href="#read"><b>read </b><i>channelId
    numChars</i></a></dt>
  <dd>In this form <b>read</b> blocks until <i>numChars</i> have been received
      from the serial port.</dd>
  <dt id="read~2"><a class="permalink" href="#read~2"><b>read
    </b><i>channelId</i></a></dt>
  <dd>In this form <b>read</b> blocks until the reception of the end-of-file
      character, see <b>fconfigure -eofchar</b>. If there no end-of-file
      character has been configured for the channel, then <b>read</b> will block
      forever.</dd>
