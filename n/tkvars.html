   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The following Tcl variables are either set or used by Tk at
    various times in its execution:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="tk_library"><a class="permalink" href="#tk_library"><b>tk_library</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This variable holds the file name for a directory containing a library of
      Tcl scripts related to Tk. These scripts include an initialization file
      that is normally processed whenever a Tk application starts up, plus other
      files containing procedures that implement default behaviors for widgets.
      The initial value of <b>tcl_library</b> is set when Tk is added to an
      interpreter; this is done by searching several different directories until
      one is found that contains an appropriate Tk startup script. If the
      <b>TK_LIBRARY</b> environment variable exists, then the directory it names
      is checked first. If <b>TK_LIBRARY</b> is not set or does not refer to an
      appropriate directory, then Tk checks several other directories based on a
      compiled-in default location, the location of the Tcl library directory,
      the location of the binary containing the application, and the current
      working directory. The variable can be modified by an application to
      switch to a different library.</dd>
  <dt id="tk_patchLevel"><a class="permalink" href="#tk_patchLevel"><b>tk_patchLevel</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Contains a decimal integer giving the current patch level for Tk. The
      patch level is incremented for each new release or patch, and it uniquely
      identifies an official version of Tk.</dd>
  <dt id="tk::Priv"><a class="permalink" href="#tk::Priv"><b>tk::Priv</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This variable is an array containing several pieces of information that
      are private to Tk. The elements of <b>tk::Priv</b> are used by Tk library
      procedures and default bindings. They should not be accessed by any code
      outside Tk.</dd>
  <dt id="tk_strictMotif"><a class="permalink" href="#tk_strictMotif"><b>tk_strictMotif</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This variable is set to zero by default. If an application sets it to one,
      then Tk attempts to adhere as closely as possible to Motif look-and-feel
      standards. For example, active elements such as buttons and scrollbar
      sliders will not change color when the pointer passes over them.</dd>
  <dt id="tk_textRedraw"><a class="permalink" href="#tk_textRedraw"><b>tk_textRedraw</b></a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="tk_textRelayout"><a class="permalink" href="#tk_textRelayout"><b>tk_textRelayout</b></a></dt>
  <dd>These variables are set by text widgets when they have debugging turned
      on. The values written to these variables can be used to test or debug
      text widget operations. These variables are mostly used by Tk's test
      suite.</dd>
  <dt id="tk_version"><a class="permalink" href="#tk_version"><b>tk_version</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Tk sets this variable in the interpreter for each application. The
      variable holds the current version number of the Tk library in the form
      <i>major</i>.<i>minor</i>. <i>Major</i> and <i>minor</i> are integers. The
      major version number increases in any Tk release that includes changes
      that are not backward compatible (i.e. whenever existing Tk applications
      and scripts may have to change to work with the new release). The minor
      version number increases with each new release of Tk, except that it
      resets to zero whenever the major version number changes.
