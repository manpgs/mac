   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This command is used to delay execution of the program or to
    execute a command in background sometime in the future. It has several
    forms, depending on the first argument to the command:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="after"><a class="permalink" href="#after"><b>after
    </b><i>ms</i></a></dt>
  <dd><i>Ms</i> must be an integer giving a time in milliseconds. The command
      sleeps for <i>ms</i> milliseconds and then returns. While the command is
      sleeping the application does not respond to events.</dd>
  <dt id="after~2"><a class="permalink" href="#after~2"><b>after </b><i>ms
    </i>?<i>script script script ...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>In this form the command returns immediately, but it arranges for a Tcl
      command to be executed <i>ms</i> milliseconds later as an event handler.
      The command will be executed exactly once, at the given time. The delayed
      command is formed by concatenating all the <i>script</i> arguments in the
      same fashion as the <b>concat</b> command. The command will be executed at
      global level (outside the context of any Tcl procedure). If an error
      occurs while executing the delayed command then the background error will
      be reported by the command registered with <b> interp bgerror</b>. The
      <b>after</b> command returns an identifier that can be used to cancel the
      delayed command using <b>after cancel</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="after~3"><a class="permalink" href="#after~3"><b>after cancel
    </b><i>id</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Cancels the execution of a delayed command that was previously scheduled.
      <i>Id</i> indicates which command should be canceled; it must have been
      the return value from a previous <b>after</b> command. If the command
      given by <i>id</i> has already been executed then the <b>after cancel</b>
      command has no effect.</dd>
  <dt id="after~4"><a class="permalink" href="#after~4"><b>after cancel
    </b><i>script script ...</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This command also cancels the execution of a delayed command. The
      <i>script</i> arguments are concatenated together with space separators
      (just as in the <b>concat</b> command). If there is a pending command that
      matches the string, it is cancelled and will never be executed; if no such
      command is currently pending then the <b>after cancel</b> command has no
      effect.</dd>
  <dt id="after~5"><a class="permalink" href="#after~5"><b>after idle
    </b><i>script </i>?<i>script script ...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Concatenates the <i>script</i> arguments together with space separators
      (just as in the <b>concat</b> command), and arranges for the resulting
      script to be evaluated later as an idle callback. The script will be run
      exactly once, the next time the event loop is entered and there are no
      events to process. The command returns an identifier that can be used to
      cancel the delayed command using <b>after cancel</b>. If an error occurs
      while executing the script then the background error will be reported by
      the command registered with <b> interp bgerror</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="after~6"><a class="permalink" href="#after~6"><b>after info
    </b>?<i>id</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>This command returns information about existing event handlers. If no
      <i>id</i> argument is supplied, the command returns a list of the
      identifiers for all existing event handlers created by the <b>after</b>
      command for this interpreter. If <i>id</i> is supplied, it specifies an
      existing handler; <i>id</i> must have been the return value from some
      previous call to <b>after</b> and it must not have triggered yet or been
      cancelled. In this case the command returns a list with two elements. The
      first element of the list is the script associated with <i>id</i>, and the
      second element is either <b>idle</b> or <b>timer</b> to indicate what kind
      of event handler it is.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <b>after </b><i>ms</i> and <b>after idle</b> forms of the
    command assume that the application is event driven: the delayed commands
    will not be executed unless the application enters the event loop. In
    applications that are not normally event-driven, such as <b>tclsh</b>, the
    event loop can be entered with the <b>vwait</b> and <b>update</b>
  commands.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This defines a command to make Tcl do nothing at all for <i>N</i>
    seconds:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
proc sleep {N} {
<br/>
   <b>after</b> [expr {int($N * 1000)}]
}
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This arranges for the command <i>wake_up</i> to be run in eight
    hours (providing the event loop is active at that time):</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>after</b> [expr {1000 * 60 * 60 * 8}] wake_up
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The following command can be used to do long-running calculations
    (as represented here by <i>::my_calc::one_step</i>, which is assumed to
    return a boolean indicating whether another step should be performed) in a
    step-by-step fashion, though the calculation itself needs to be arranged so
    it can work step-wise. This technique is extra careful to ensure that the
    event loop is not starved by the rescheduling of processing steps (arranging
    for the next step to be done using an already-triggered timer event only
    when the event queue has been drained) and is useful when you want to ensure
    that a Tk GUI remains responsive during a slow task.</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
proc doOneStep {} {
<br/>
   if {[::my_calc::one_step]} {
<br/>
      <b>after idle</b> [list <b>after</b> 0 doOneStep]
<br/>
   }
}
