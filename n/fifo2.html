   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">The command described here is only available in a not-yet released
    version of the package. Use the CVS to get the sources.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="fifo2"><a class="permalink" href="#fifo2"><b>fifo2</b></a></dt>
  <dd>creates two stream-oriented in-memory channels and returns their handles
      as a two-element list. There is no restriction on the ultimate size of the
      channels, they will always grow as much as is necessary to accomodate the
      data written into them.
    <p class="Pp">In contrast to the channels generated by <b>fifo</b> a pair of
        channels created here is connected internally in such a way that data
        written into one channel can be read from the other. All data written
        into them is read in the same order. This also means that the two
        channels of the pair are not seekable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The channels created here can be transfered between
        interpreters in the same thread and between threads. As both channels in
        the pair can be transfered independently they can be used to create a
        bidirectional connection between two interpreters.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Memory channels created by <b>fifo2</b> provide two read-only
    options which can be queried via the standard <b>fconfigure</b> command.
    These are</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="rlength"><a class="permalink" href="#rlength">-rlength</a></dt>
  <dd>The value of this option is the number of bytes currently available for
      reading from the channel.</dd>
  <dt id="wlength"><a class="permalink" href="#wlength">-wlength</a></dt>
  <dd>The value of this option is the number of bytes currently written into the
      channel.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Note that the two lengths are switched for the channels of a pair.
    In other words, the number of bytes written for one of the channels is the
    number of bytes readable from the other end.</p>
<p class="Pp">As the channels generated by <b>fifo2</b> grow as necessary they
    are always writable. This means that a writable <b>fileevent</b>-handler
    will fire continuously.</p>
<p class="Pp">The channels are also readable if they contain more than zero
    bytes. Under this conditions a readable <b>fileevent</b>-handler will fire
    continuously.</p>
