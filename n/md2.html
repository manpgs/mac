   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">The command <b>md2</b> is one of several message digests provided
    by the package <b>trf</b>. See <b>trf-intro</b> for an overview of the whole
    package.</p>

  <dd>The options listed below are understood by the digest if and only if the
      digest is <i>attached</i> to a channel. See section <b>IMMEDIATE versus
      ATTACHED</b> for an explanation of the term <i>attached</i>.</dd>

  <dt id="mode"><a class="permalink" href="#mode"><b>-mode</b>
    <b>absorb</b>|<b>write</b>|<b>transparent</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This option has to be present. The specified argument determines the
      behaviour of the digest in <i>attached</i> mode.
    <p class="Pp">Beyond the argument values listed above all unique
        abbreviations are recognized too. Their meaning is explained below:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="absorb"><a class="permalink" href="#absorb"><b>absorb</b></a></dt>
  <dd>All data written to the channel is used to calculate the value of the
      message digest and then passed unchanged to the next level in the stack of
      transformations for the channel the digest is attached to. When the
      channel is closed the completed digest is written out too, essentially
      attaching the vlaue of the diggest after the information actually written
      to the channel.
    <p class="Pp">When reading from the channel a value for the digest is
        computed too, and after closing of the channel compared to the digest
        which was attached, i.e. came behind the actual data. The option
        <b>-matchflag</b> has to be specified so that the digest knows where to
        store the result of said comparison. This result is a string and either
        &quot;<b>ok</b>&quot;, or &quot;<b>failed</b>&quot;.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="write"><a class="permalink" href="#write"><b>write</b></a></dt>
  <dd>All data read from or written to the channel the digest is attached to is
      ignored and thrown away. Only a value for the digest of the data is
      computed. When the channel is closed the computed values are stored as
      ordered through the options <b>-write-destination</b>, <b>-write-type</b>,
      <b>-read-destination</b>, and <b>-read-type</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="transparent"><a class="permalink" href="#transparent"><b>transparent</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This mode is a mixture of both <b>absorb</b> and <b>write</b> modes. As
      for <b>absorb</b> all data, read or written, passes through the digest
      unchanged. The generated values for the digest however are handled in the
      same way as for <b>write</b>.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="matchflag"><a class="permalink" href="#matchflag"><b>-matchflag</b>
    <i>varname</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This option can be used if and only if the option &quot;<b>-mode</b>
      <b>absorb</b>&quot; is present. In that situation the argument is the name
      of a global or namespaced variable. The digest will write the result of
      comparing two digest values into this variable. The option will be ignored
      if the channel is write-only, because in that case there will be no
      comparison of digest values.</dd>
  <dt id="write_type"><a class="permalink" href="#write_type"><b>-write-type</b>
    <b>variable</b>|<b>channel</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This option can be used for digests in mode <b>write</b> or
      <b>transparent</b>. Beyond the values listed above all their unique
      abbreviations are also allowed as argument values. The option determines
      the type of the argument to option <b>-write-destination</b>. It defaults
      to <b>variable</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="read_type"><a class="permalink" href="#read_type"><b>-read-type</b>
    <b>variable</b>|<b>channel</b></a></dt>

  <dt id="write_destination"><a class="permalink" href="#write_destination"><b>-write-destination</b>
    <i>data</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This option can be used for digests in mode <b>write</b> or
      <b>transparent</b>. The value <i>data</i> is either the name of a global
      (or namespaced) variable or the handle of a writable channel, dependent on
      the value of option <b>-write-type</b>. The message digest computed for
      data written to the attached channel is written into it after the attached
      channel was closed. The option is ignored if the channel is read-only.
    <p class="Pp"><i>Note</i> that using a variable may yield incorrect results
        under tcl 7.6, due to embedded \0's.</p>
  </dd>

    <i>data</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This option can be used for digests in mode <b>write</b> or
      <b>transparent</b>. The value <i>data</i> is either the name of a global
      (or namespaced) variable or the handle of a writable channel, dependent on
      the value of option <b>-read-type</b>. The message digest computed for
      data read from the attached channel is written into it after the attached
      channel was closed. The option is ignored if the channel is write-only.

        under tcl 7.6, due to embedded \0's.</p>

  <dd>The presence/absence of this option determines the main operation mode of
      the transformation.
    <p class="Pp">If present the transformation will be stacked onto the
        <i>channel</i> whose handle was given to the option and run in
        <i>attached</i> mode. More about this in section <b>IMMEDIATE versus
        ATTACHED</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the option is absent the transformation is used in
        <i>immediate</i> mode and the options listed below are recognized. More

  </dd>
  <dt id="in"><a class="permalink" href="#in"><b>-in</b> <i>channel</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This options is legal if and only if the transformation is used in
      <i>immediate</i> mode. It provides the handle of the channel the data to
      transform has to be read from.
    <p class="Pp">If the transformation is in <i>immediate</i> mode and this
        option is absent the data to transform is expected as the last argument
        to the transformation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="out"><a class="permalink" href="#out"><b>-out</b>
    <i>channel</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This options is legal if and only if the transformation is used in
      <i>immediate</i> mode. It provides the handle of the channel the generated
      transformation result is written to.
    <p class="Pp">If the transformation is in <i>immediate</i> mode and this
        option is absent the generated data is returned as the result of the
        command itself.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="IMMEDIATE_VERSUS_ATTACHED"><a class="permalink" href="#IMMEDIATE_VERSUS_ATTACHED">IMMEDIATE
  VERSUS ATTACHED</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The transformation distinguishes between two main ways of using
    it. These are the <i>immediate</i> and <i>attached</i> operation modes.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the <i>attached</i> mode the option <b>-attach</b> is used to
    associate the transformation with an existing channel. During the execution
    of the command no transformation is performed, instead the channel is
    changed in such a way, that from then on all data written to or read from it
    passes through the transformation and is modified by it according to the
    definition above. This attachment can be revoked by executing the command
    <b>unstack</b> for the chosen channel. This is the only way to do this at
    the Tcl level.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the second mode, which can be detected by the absence of option
    <b>-attach</b>, the transformation immediately takes data from either its
    commandline or a channel, transforms it, and returns the result either as
    result of the command, or writes it into a channel. The mode is named after
    the immediate nature of its execution.</p>
<p class="Pp">Where the data is taken from, and delivered to, is governed by the
    presence and absence of the options <b>-in</b> and <b>-out</b>. It should be
    noted that this ability to immediately read from and/or write to a channel
    is an historic artifact which was introduced at the beginning of Trf's life
    when Tcl version 7.6 was current as this and earlier versions have trouble
    to deal with \0 characters embedded into either input or output.</p>
