   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

  OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">[<span class="Op"><b>-postcommand</b> <i>postCommand</i>]</span>
    If this option is specified then it provides a Tcl command to execute each
    time the menu is posted. The command is invoked by the <b>post</b> widget
    command before posting the menu. Note that in Tk 8.0 on Macintosh and
    Windows, all post-commands in a system of menus are executed before any of
    those menus are posted. This is due to the limitations in the individual
    platforms' menu managers. [<span class="Op"><b>-selectcolor</b>
    <i>selectColor</i>]</span> For menu entries that are check buttons or radio
    buttons, this option specifies the color to display in the indicator when
    the check button or radio button is selected.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-tearoff</b> <i>tearOff</i>]</span> This option must
    have a proper boolean value, which specifies whether or not the menu should
    include a tear-off entry at the top. If so, it will exist as entry 0 of the
    menu and the other entries will number starting at 1. The default menu
    bindings arrange for the menu to be torn off when the tear-off entry is
    invoked. [<span class="Op"><b>-tearoffcommand</b>
    <i>tearOffCommand</i>]</span> If this option has a non-empty value, then it
    specifies a Tcl command to invoke whenever the menu is torn off. The actual
    command will consist of the value of this option, followed by a space,
    followed by the name of the menu window, followed by a space, followed by
    the name of the name of the torn off menu window. For example, if the
    option's value is &#x201C;<b>a b</b>&#x201D; and menu <b>.x.y</b> is torn
    off to create a new menu <b>.x.tearoff1</b>, then the command &#x201C;<b>a b
    .x.y .x.tearoff1</b>&#x201D; will be invoked.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-title</b> <i>title</i>]</span> The string will be used
    to title the window created when this menu is torn off. If the title is
    NULL, then the window will have the title of the menubutton or the text of
    the cascade item from which this menu was invoked.
    [<span class="Op"><b>-type</b> <i>type</i>]</span> This option can be one of
    <b>menubar</b>, <b>tearoff</b>, or <b>normal</b>, and is set when the menu
    is created. While the string returned by the configuration database will
    change if this option is changed, this does not affect the menu widget's
    behavior. This is used by the cloning mechanism and is not normally set
    outside of the Tk library.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="INTRODUCTION"><a class="permalink" href="#INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>menu</b> command creates a new top-level window (given by
    the <i>pathName</i> argument) and makes it into a menu widget. Additional
    options, described above, may be specified on the command line or in the
    option database to configure aspects of the menu such as its colors and
    font. The <b>menu</b> command returns its <i>pathName</i> argument. At the
    time this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
    <i>pathName</i>, but <i>pathName</i>'s parent must exist.</p>
<p class="Pp">A menu is a widget that displays a collection of one-line entries
    arranged in one or more columns. There exist several different types of
    entries, each with different properties. Entries of different types may be
    combined in a single menu. Menu entries are not the same as entry widgets.
    In fact, menu entries are not even distinct widgets; the entire menu is one
    widget.</p>
<p class="Pp">Menu entries are displayed with up to three separate fields. The
    main field is a label in the form of a text string, a bitmap, or an image,
    controlled by the <b>-label</b>, <b>-bitmap</b>, and <b>-image</b> options
    for the entry. If the <b>-accelerator</b> option is specified for an entry
    then a second textual field is displayed to the right of the label. The
    accelerator typically describes a keystroke sequence that may be typed in
    the application to cause the same result as invoking the menu entry. The
    third field is an <i>indicator</i>. The indicator is present only for
    checkbutton or radiobutton entries. It indicates whether the entry is
    selected or not, and is displayed to the left of the entry's string.</p>
<p class="Pp">In normal use, an entry becomes active (displays itself
    differently) whenever the mouse pointer is over the entry. If a mouse button
    is released over the entry then the entry is <i>invoked</i>. The effect of
    invocation is different for each type of entry; these effects are described
    below in the sections on individual entries.</p>
<p class="Pp">Entries may be <i>disabled</i>, which causes their labels and
    accelerators to be displayed with dimmer colors. The default menu bindings
    will not allow a disabled entry to be activated or invoked. Disabled entries
    may be re-enabled, at which point it becomes possible to activate and invoke
    them again.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whenever a menu's active entry is changed, a
    &lt;&lt;MenuSelect&gt;&gt; virtual event is send to the menu. The active
    item can then be queried from the menu, and an action can be taken, such as
    setting context-sensitive help text for the entry.</p>

  OF ENTRIES</a></h1>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="COMMAND_ENTRIES"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMAND_ENTRIES">COMMAND
  ENTRIES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The most common kind of menu entry is a command entry, which
    behaves much like a button widget. When a command entry is invoked, a Tcl
    command is executed. The Tcl command is specified with the <b>-command</b>
    option.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="SEPARATOR_ENTRIES"><a class="permalink" href="#SEPARATOR_ENTRIES">SEPARATOR
  ENTRIES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A separator is an entry that is displayed as a horizontal dividing
    line. A separator may not be activated or invoked, and it has no behavior
    other than its display appearance.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="CHECKBUTTON_ENTRIES"><a class="permalink" href="#CHECKBUTTON_ENTRIES">CHECKBUTTON
  ENTRIES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A checkbutton menu entry behaves much like a checkbutton widget.
    When it is invoked it toggles back and forth between the selected and
    deselected states. When the entry is selected, a particular value is stored
    in a particular global variable (as determined by the <b>-onvalue</b> and
    <b>-variable</b> options for the entry); when the entry is deselected
    another value (determined by the <b>-offvalue</b> option) is stored in the
    global variable. An indicator box is displayed to the left of the label in a
    checkbutton entry. If the entry is selected then the indicator's center is
    displayed in the color given by the <b>-selectcolor</b> option for the
    entry; otherwise the indicator's center is displayed in the background color
    for the menu. If a <b>-command</b> option is specified for a checkbutton
    entry, then its value is evaluated as a Tcl command each time the entry is
    invoked; this happens after toggling the entry's selected state.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="RADIOBUTTON_ENTRIES"><a class="permalink" href="#RADIOBUTTON_ENTRIES">RADIOBUTTON
  ENTRIES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A radiobutton menu entry behaves much like a radiobutton widget.
    Radiobutton entries are organized in groups of which only one entry may be
    selected at a time. Whenever a particular entry becomes selected it stores a
    particular value into a particular global variable (as determined by the
    <b>-value</b> and <b>-variable</b> options for the entry). This action
    causes any previously-selected entry in the same group to deselect itself.
    Once an entry has become selected, any change to the entry's associated
    variable will cause the entry to deselect itself. Grouping of radiobutton
    entries is determined by their associated variables: if two entries have the
    same associated variable then they are in the same group. An indicator
    diamond is displayed to the left of the label in each radiobutton entry. If
    the entry is selected then the indicator's center is displayed in the color
    given by the <b>-selectcolor</b> option for the entry; otherwise the
    indicator's center is displayed in the background color for the menu. If a
    <b>-command</b> option is specified for a radiobutton entry, then its value
    is evaluated as a Tcl command each time the entry is invoked; this happens
    after selecting the entry.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="CASCADE_ENTRIES"><a class="permalink" href="#CASCADE_ENTRIES">CASCADE
  ENTRIES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A cascade entry is one with an associated menu (determined by the
    <b>-menu</b> option). Cascade entries allow the construction of cascading
    menus. The <b>postcascade</b> widget command can be used to post and unpost
    the associated menu just next to of the cascade entry. The associated menu
    must be a child of the menu containing the cascade entry (this is needed in
    order for menu traversal to work correctly).</p>
<p class="Pp">A cascade entry posts its associated menu by invoking a Tcl
    command of the form</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>menu</i><b> post </b><i>x y</i></pre>
</div>
where <i>menu</i> is the path name of the associated menu, and <i>x</i> and
  <i>y</i> are the root-window coordinates of the upper-right corner of the
  cascade entry. On Unix, the lower-level menu is unposted by executing a Tcl
  command with the form
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>menu</i><b> unpost</b></pre>
</div>
where <i>menu</i> is the name of the associated menu. On other platforms, the
  platform's native code takes care of unposting the menu.
<p class="Pp">If a <b>-command</b> option is specified for a cascade entry then
    it is evaluated as a Tcl command whenever the entry is invoked. This is not
    supported on Windows.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="TEAR-OFF_ENTRIES"><a class="permalink" href="#TEAR-OFF_ENTRIES">TEAR-OFF
  ENTRIES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A tear-off entry appears at the top of the menu if enabled with
    the <b>tearOff</b> option. It is not like other menu entries in that it
    cannot be created with the <b>add</b> widget command and cannot be deleted
    with the <b>delete</b> widget command. When a tear-off entry is created it
    appears as a dashed line at the top of the menu. Under the default bindings,
    invoking the tear-off entry causes a torn-off copy to be made of the menu
    and all of its submenus.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MENUBARS"><a class="permalink" href="#MENUBARS">MENUBARS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Any menu can be set as a menubar for a toplevel window (see
    <b>toplevel</b> command for syntax). On the Macintosh, whenever the toplevel
    is in front, this menu's cascade items will appear in the menubar across the
    top of the main monitor. On Windows and Unix, this menu's items will be
    displayed in a menubar across the top of the window. These menus will behave
    according to the interface guidelines of their platforms. For every menu set
    as a menubar, a clone menu is made. See the <b>CLONES</b> section for more
    information.</p>
<p class="Pp">As noted, menubars may behave differently on different platforms.
    One example of this concerns the handling of checkbuttons and radiobuttons
    within the menu. While it is permitted to put these menu elements on
    menubars, they may not be drawn with indicators on some platforms, due to
    system restrictions.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="SPECIAL_MENUS_IN_MENUBARS"><a class="permalink" href="#SPECIAL_MENUS_IN_MENUBARS">SPECIAL
  MENUS IN MENUBARS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Certain menus in a menubar will be treated specially. On the
    Macintosh, access to the special Application, Window and Help menus is
    provided. On Windows, access to the Windows System menu in each window is
    provided. On X Windows, a special right-justified help menu may be provided
    if Motif menu compatibility is enabled. In all cases, these menus must be
    created with the command name of the menubar menu concatenated with the
    special name. So for a menubar named .menubar, on the Macintosh, the special
    menus would be .menubar.apple,</p>
<p class="Pp">When Tk sees a .menubar.apple menu as the first menu in a menubar
    on the Macintosh, that menu's contents make up the first items of the
    Application menu whenever the window containing the menubar is in front.
    After all of the Tk-defined items, the menu will have a separator, followed
    by all standard Application menu items. Such a .apple menu must be present
    in a menu when that menu is first configured as a toplevel's menubar,
    otherwise a default application menu (hidden from Tk) will be inserted into
    the menubar at that time and subsequent addition of a .apple menu will no
    longer result in it becoming the Application menu.</p>
<p class="Pp">When Tk sees a .menubar.window menu on the Macintosh, the menu's
    contents are inserted into the standard Window menu of the user's menubar
    whenever the window's menubar is in front. The first items in the menu are
    provided by Mac OS X, and the names of the current toplevels are
    automatically appended after all the Tk-defined items and a separator.</p>
<p class="Pp">When Tk sees a .menubar.help menu on the Macintosh, the menu's
    contents are appended to the standard Help menu of the user's menubar
    whenever the window's menubar is in front. The first items in the menu are
    provided by Mac OS X.</p>
<p class="Pp">When Tk sees a System menu on Windows, its items are appended to
    the system menu that the menubar is attached to. This menu has an icon
    representing a spacebar, and can be invoked with the mouse or by typing
    Alt+Spacebar. Due to limitations in the Windows API, any font changes,
    colors, images, bitmaps, or tearoff images will not appear in the system
    menu.</p>
<p class="Pp">When Tk sees a Help menu on X Windows and Motif menu compatibility
    is enabled the menu is moved to be last in the menubar and is right
    justified. Motif menu compatibility is enabled by setting the Tk option
    <b>*Menu.useMotifHelp</b> to true or by calling <b>tk::classic::restore
    menu</b>.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CLONES"><a class="permalink" href="#CLONES">CLONES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When a menu is set as a menubar for a toplevel window, or when a
    menu is torn off, a clone of the menu is made. This clone is a menu widget
    in its own right, but it is a child of the original. Changes in the
    configuration of the original are reflected in the clone. Additionally, any
    cascades that are pointed to are also cloned so that menu traversal will
    work right. Clones are destroyed when either the tearoff or menubar goes
    away, or when the original menu is destroyed.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="WIDGET_COMMAND"><a class="permalink" href="#WIDGET_COMMAND">WIDGET
  COMMAND</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>menu</b> command creates a new Tcl command whose name is
    <i>pathName</i>. This command may be used to invoke various operations on
    the widget. It has the following general form:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<i>pathName option </i>?<i>arg arg ...</i>?</pre>
</div>
<i>Option</i> and the <i>arg</i>s determine the exact behavior of the command.
<p class="Pp">Many of the widget commands for a menu take as one argument an
    indicator of which entry of the menu to operate on. These indicators are
    called <i>index</i>es and may be specified in any of the following
  forms:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="number"><a class="permalink" href="#number"><i>number</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the entry numerically, where 0 corresponds to the top-most entry
      of the menu, 1 to the entry below it, and so on.</dd>
  <dt id="active"><a class="permalink" href="#active"><b>active</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates the entry that is currently active. If no entry is active then
      this form is equivalent to <b>none</b>. This form may not be
    abbreviated.</dd>
  <dt id="end"><a class="permalink" href="#end"><b>end</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates the bottommost entry in the menu. If there are no entries in the
      menu then this form is equivalent to <b>none</b>. This form may not be
      abbreviated.</dd>
  <dt id="last"><a class="permalink" href="#last"><b>last</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Same as <b>end</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="none"><a class="permalink" href="#none"><b>none</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates &#x201C;no entry at all&#x201D;; this is used most commonly with
      the <b>activate</b> option to deactivate all the entries in the menu. In
      most cases the specification of <b>none</b> causes nothing to happen in
      the widget command. This form may not be abbreviated.</dd>
  <dt><b>@</b><i>number</i></dt>
  <dd>In this form, <i>number</i> is treated as a y-coordinate in the menu's
      window; the entry closest to that y-coordinate is used. For example,
      &#x201C;<b>@0</b>&#x201D; indicates the top-most entry in the window.</dd>
  <dt id="pattern"><a class="permalink" href="#pattern"><i>pattern</i></a></dt>
  <dd>If the index does not satisfy one of the above forms then this form is
      used. <i>Pattern</i> is pattern-matched against the label of each entry in
      the menu, in order from the top down, until a matching entry is found. The
      rules of <b>Tcl_StringMatch</b> are used.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The following widget commands are possible for menu widgets:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="pathName"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName"><i>pathName
    </i><b>activate </b><i>index</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Change the state of the entry indicated by <i>index</i> to <b>active</b>
      and redisplay it using its active colors. Any previously-active entry is
      deactivated. If <i>index</i> is specified as <b>none</b>, or if the
      specified entry is disabled, then the menu ends up with no active entry.
      Returns an empty string.</dd>
  <dt id="pathName~2"><a class="permalink" href="#pathName~2"><i>pathName
    </i><b>add </b><i>type </i>?<i>option value option value ...</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Add a new entry to the bottom of the menu. The new entry's type is given
      by <i>type</i> and must be one of <b>cascade</b>, <b>checkbutton</b>,
      <b>command</b>, <b>radiobutton</b>, or <b>separator</b>, or a unique
      abbreviation of one of the above. If additional arguments are present,
      they specify any of the following options:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="activebackground"><a class="permalink" href="#activebackground"><b>-activebackground
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a background color to use for displaying this entry when it is
      active. If this option is specified as an empty string (the default), then
      the <b>activeBackground</b> option for the overall menu is used. If the
      <b>tk_strictMotif</b> variable has been set to request strict Motif
      compliance, then this option is ignored and the <b>-background</b> option
      is used in its place. This option is not available for separator or
      tear-off entries.</dd>
  <dt id="activeforeground"><a class="permalink" href="#activeforeground"><b>-activeforeground
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying this entry when it is
      active. If this option is specified as an empty string (the default), then
      the <b>activeForeground</b> option for the overall menu is used. This
      option is not available for separator or tear-off entries.</dd>
  <dt id="accelerator"><a class="permalink" href="#accelerator"><b>-accelerator
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a string to display at the right side of the menu entry.
      Normally describes an accelerator keystroke sequence that may be typed to
      invoke the same function as the menu entry. This option is not available
      for separator or tear-off entries.</dd>
  <dt id="background"><a class="permalink" href="#background"><b>-background
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a background color to use for displaying this entry when it is
      in the normal state (neither active nor disabled). If this option is
      specified as an empty string (the default), then the <b>background</b>
      option for the overall menu is used. This option is not available for
      separator or tear-off entries.</dd>
  <dt id="bitmap"><a class="permalink" href="#bitmap"><b>-bitmap
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a bitmap to display in the menu instead of a textual label, in
      any of the forms accepted by <b>Tk_GetBitmap</b>. This option overrides
      the <b>-label</b> option (as controlled by the <b>-compound</b> option)
      but may be reset to an empty string to enable a textual label to be
      displayed. If a <b>-image</b> option has been specified, it overrides
      <b>-bitmap</b>. This option is not available for separator or tear-off
      entries.</dd>
  <dt id="columnbreak"><a class="permalink" href="#columnbreak"><b>-columnbreak
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>When this option is zero, the entry appears below the previous entry. When
      this option is one, the entry appears at the top of a new column in the
      menu.</dd>
  <dt id="command"><a class="permalink" href="#command"><b>-command
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a Tcl command to execute when the menu entry is invoked. Not
      available for separator or tear-off entries.</dd>
  <dt id="compound"><a class="permalink" href="#compound"><b>-compound
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies whether the menu entry should display both an image and text,
      and if so, where the image should be placed relative to the text. Valid
      values for this option are <b>bottom</b>, <b>center</b>, <b>left</b>,
      <b>none</b>, <b>right</b> and <b>top</b>. The default value is
      <b>none</b>, meaning that the button will display either an image or text,
      depending on the values of the <b>-image</b> and <b>-bitmap</b>
    options.</dd>
  <dt id="font"><a class="permalink" href="#font"><b>-font
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the font to use when drawing the label or accelerator string in
      this entry. If this option is specified as an empty string (the default)
      then the <b>font</b> option for the overall menu is used. This option is
      not available for separator or tear-off entries.</dd>
  <dt id="foreground"><a class="permalink" href="#foreground"><b>-foreground
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying this entry when it is
      in the normal state (neither active nor disabled). If this option is
      specified as an empty string (the default), then the <b>foreground</b>
      option for the overall menu is used. This option is not available for
      separator or tear-off entries.</dd>
  <dt id="hidemargin"><a class="permalink" href="#hidemargin"><b>-hidemargin
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies whether the standard margins should be drawn for this menu
      entry. This is useful when creating palette with images in them, i.e.,
      color palettes, pattern palettes, etc. 1 indicates that the margin for the
      entry is hidden; 0 means that the margin is used.</dd>
  <dt id="image"><a class="permalink" href="#image"><b>-image
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies an image to display in the menu instead of a text string or
      bitmap. The image must have been created by some previous invocation of
      <b>image create</b>. This option overrides the <b>-label</b> and
      <b>-bitmap</b> options (as controlled by the <b>-compound</b> option) but
      may be reset to an empty string to enable a textual or bitmap label to be
      displayed. This option is not available for separator or tear-off
    entries.</dd>
  <dt id="indicatoron"><a class="permalink" href="#indicatoron"><b>-indicatoron
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries. <i>Value</i> is a
      boolean that determines whether or not the indicator should be
    displayed.</dd>
  <dt id="label"><a class="permalink" href="#label"><b>-label
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a string to display as an identifying label in the menu entry.
      Not available for separator or tear-off entries.</dd>
  <dt id="menu"><a class="permalink" href="#menu"><b>-menu
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Available only for cascade entries. Specifies the path name of the submenu
      associated with this entry. The submenu must be a child of the menu.</dd>
  <dt id="offvalue"><a class="permalink" href="#offvalue"><b>-offvalue
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Available only for checkbutton entries. Specifies the value to store in
      the entry's associated variable when the entry is deselected.</dd>
  <dt id="onvalue"><a class="permalink" href="#onvalue"><b>-onvalue
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Available only for checkbutton entries. Specifies the value to store in
      the entry's associated variable when the entry is selected.</dd>
  <dt id="selectcolor"><a class="permalink" href="#selectcolor"><b>-selectcolor
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries. Specifies the
      color to display in the indicator when the entry is selected. If the value
      is an empty string (the default) then the <b>selectColor</b> option for
      the menu determines the indicator color.</dd>
  <dt id="selectimage"><a class="permalink" href="#selectimage"><b>-selectimage
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries. Specifies an image
      to display in the entry (in place of the <b>-image</b> option) when it is
      selected. <i>Value</i> is the name of an image, which must have been
      created by some previous invocation of <b>image create</b>. This option is
      ignored unless the <b>-image</b> option has been specified.</dd>
  <dt id="state"><a class="permalink" href="#state"><b>-state
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies one of three states for the entry: <b>normal</b>, <b>active</b>,
      or <b>disabled</b>. In normal state the entry is displayed using the
      <b>foreground</b> option for the menu and the <b>background</b> option
      from the entry or the menu. The active state is typically used when the
      pointer is over the entry. In active state the entry is displayed using
      the <b>activeForeground</b> option for the menu along with the
      <b>activebackground</b> option from the entry. Disabled state means that
      the entry should be insensitive: the default bindings will refuse to
      activate or invoke the entry. In this state the entry is displayed
      according to the <b>disabledForeground</b> option for the menu and the
      <b>background</b> option from the entry. This option is not available for
      separator entries.</dd>
  <dt id="underline"><a class="permalink" href="#underline"><b>-underline
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the integer index of a character to underline in the entry. This
      option is also queried by the default bindings and used to implement
      keyboard traversal. 0 corresponds to the first character of the text
      displayed in the entry, 1 to the next character, and so on. If a bitmap or
      image is displayed in the entry then this option is ignored. This option
      is not available for separator or tear-off entries.</dd>
  <dt id="value"><a class="permalink" href="#value"><b>-value
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Available only for radiobutton entries. Specifies the value to store in
      the entry's associated variable when the entry is selected. If an empty
      string is specified, then the <b>-label</b> option for the entry as the
      value to store in the variable.</dd>
  <dt id="variable"><a class="permalink" href="#variable"><b>-variable
    </b><i>value</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Available only for checkbutton and radiobutton entries. Specifies the name
      of a global value to set when the entry is selected. For checkbutton
      entries the variable is also set when the entry is deselected. For
      radiobutton entries, changing the variable causes the currently-selected
      entry to deselect itself.</dd>

      the result of that command is returned as the result of the <b>invoke</b>
      widget command. Otherwise the result is an empty string. Note: invoking a

<p class="Pp">The default bindings support four different ways of using
  menus:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Pulldown"><a class="permalink" href="#Pulldown"><b>Pulldown Menus in
    Menubar</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This is the most common case. You create a menu widget that will become
      the menu bar. You then add cascade entries to this menu, specifying the
      pull down menus you wish to use in your menu bar. You then create all of
      the pulldowns. Once you have done this, specify the menu using the
      <b>-menu</b> option of the toplevel's widget command. See the
      <b>toplevel</b> manual entry for details.</dd>
  <dt id="Pulldown~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Pulldown~2"><b>Pulldown Menus
    in Menu Buttons</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This is the compatible way to do menu bars. You create one menubutton
      widget for each top-level menu, and typically you arrange a series of
      menubuttons in a row in a menubar window. You also create the top-level
      menus and any cascaded submenus, and tie them together with <b>-menu</b>
      options in menubuttons and cascade menu entries. The top-level menu must
      be a child of the menubutton, and each submenu must be a child of the menu
      that refers to it. Once you have done this, the default bindings will
      allow users to traverse and invoke the tree of menus via its menubutton;
      see the <b>menubutton</b> manual entry for details.</dd>
  <dt id="Popup"><a class="permalink" href="#Popup"><b>Popup Menus</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Popup menus typically post in response to a mouse button press or
      keystroke. You create the popup menus and any cascaded submenus, then you
      call the <b>tk_popup</b> procedure at the appropriate time to post the
      top-level menu.</dd>
  <dt id="Option"><a class="permalink" href="#Option"><b>Option
    Menus</b></a></dt>
  <dd>An option menu consists of a menubutton with an associated menu that
      allows you to select one of several values. The current value is displayed
      in the menubutton and is also stored in a global variable. Use the
      <b>tk_optionMenu</b> procedure to create option menubuttons and their
      menus.</dd>
  <dt id="Torn_off"><a class="permalink" href="#Torn_off"><b>Torn-off
    Menus</b></a></dt>
  <dd>You create a torn-off menu by invoking the tear-off entry at the top of an
      existing menu. The default bindings will create a new menu that is a copy
      of the original menu and leave it permanently posted as a top-level
      window. The torn-off menu behaves just the same as the original menu.</dd>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DEFAULT_BINDINGS"><a class="permalink" href="#DEFAULT_BINDINGS">DEFAULT
  BINDINGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Tk automatically creates class bindings for menus that give them
    the following default behavior:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>When the mouse enters a menu, the entry underneath the mouse cursor
      activates; as the mouse moves around the menu, the active entry changes to
      track the mouse.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>When the mouse leaves a menu all of the entries in the menu deactivate,
      except in the special case where the mouse moves from a menu to a cascaded
      submenu.</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>When a button is released over a menu, the active entry (if any) is
      invoked. The menu also unposts unless it is a torn-off menu.</dd>
  <dt>[4]</dt>
  <dd>The Space and Return keys invoke the active entry and unpost the
    menu.</dd>
  <dt>[5]</dt>
  <dd>If any of the entries in a menu have letters underlined with the
      <b>-underline</b> option, then pressing one of the underlined letters (or
      its upper-case or lower-case equivalent) invokes that entry and unposts
      the menu.</dd>
  <dt>[6]</dt>
  <dd>The Escape key aborts a menu selection in progress without invoking any
      entry. It also unposts the menu unless it is a torn-off menu.</dd>
  <dt>[7]</dt>
  <dd>The Up and Down keys activate the next higher or lower entry in the menu.
      When one end of the menu is reached, the active entry wraps around to the
      other end.</dd>
  <dt>[8]</dt>
  <dd>The Left key moves to the next menu to the left. If the current menu is a
      cascaded submenu, then the submenu is unposted and the current menu entry
      becomes the cascade entry in the parent. If the current menu is a
      top-level menu posted from a menubutton, then the current menubutton is
      unposted and the next menubutton to the left is posted. Otherwise the key
      has no effect. The left-right order of menubuttons is determined by their
      stacking order: Tk assumes that the lowest menubutton (which by default is
      the first one created) is on the left.</dd>
  <dt>[9]</dt>
  <dd>The Right key moves to the next menu to the right. If the current entry is
      a cascade entry, then the submenu is posted and the current menu entry
      becomes the first entry in the submenu. Otherwise, if the current menu was
      posted from a menubutton, then the current menubutton is unposted and the
      next menubutton to the right is posted.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Disabled menu entries are non-responsive: they do not activate and
    they ignore mouse button presses and releases.</p>
<p class="Pp">Several of the bindings make use of the command
    <b>tk_menuSetFocus</b>. It saves the current focus and sets the focus to its
    <i>pathName</i> argument, which is a menu widget.</p>
<p class="Pp">The behavior of menus can be changed by defining new bindings for
    individual widgets or by redefining the class bindings.</p>
