   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">This command parses substrings from an input string in a fashion
    similar to the ANSI C <b>sscanf</b> procedure and returns a count of the
    number of conversions performed, or -1 if the end of the input string is
    reached before any conversions have been performed. <i>String</i> gives the
    input to be parsed and <i>format</i> indicates how to parse it, using
    <b>%</b> conversion specifiers as in <b>sscanf</b>. Each <i>varName</i>
    gives the name of a variable; when a substring is scanned from <i>string</i>
    that matches a conversion specifier, the substring is assigned to the
    corresponding variable. If no <i>varName</i> variables are specified, then
    <b>scan</b> works in an inline manner, returning the data that would
    otherwise be stored in the variables as a list. In the inline case, an empty
    string is returned when the end of the input string is reached before any
    conversions have been performed.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DETAILS_ON_SCANNING"><a class="permalink" href="#DETAILS_ON_SCANNING">DETAILS
  ON SCANNING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Scan</b> operates by scanning <i>string</i> and <i>format</i>
    together. If the next character in <i>format</i> is a blank or tab then it
    matches any number of white space characters in <i>string</i> (including
    zero). Otherwise, if it is not a <b>%</b> character then it must match the
    next character of <i>string</i>. When a <b>%</b> is encountered in
    <i>format</i>, it indicates the start of a conversion specifier. A
    conversion specifier contains up to four fields after the <b>%</b>: a XPG3
    position specifier (or a <b>*</b> to indicate the converted value is to be
    discarded instead of assigned to any variable); a number indicating a
    maximum substring width; a size modifier; and a conversion character. All of
    these fields are optional except for the conversion character. The fields
    that are present must appear in the order given above.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>scan</b> finds a conversion specifier in <i>format</i>, it
    first skips any white-space characters in <i>string</i> (unless the
    conversion character is <b>[</b> or <b>c</b>). Then it converts the next
    input characters according to the conversion specifier and stores the result
    in the variable given by the next argument to <b>scan</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>%</b> is followed by a decimal number and a <b>$</b>, as
    in &#x201C;<b>%2$d</b>&#x201D;, then the variable to use is not taken from
    the next sequential argument. Instead, it is taken from the argument
    indicated by the number, where 1 corresponds to the first <i>varName</i>. If
    there are any positional specifiers in <i>format</i> then all of the
    specifiers must be positional. Every <i>varName</i> on the argument list
    must correspond to exactly one conversion specifier or an error is
    generated, or in the inline case, any position can be specified at most once
    and the empty positions will be filled in with empty strings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The size modifier field is used only when scanning a substring
    into one of Tcl's integer values. The size modifier field dictates the
    integer range acceptable to be stored in a variable, or, for the inline
    case, in a position in the result list. The syntactically valid values for
    the size modifier are <b>h</b>, <b>L</b>, <b>l</b>, and <b>ll</b>. The
    <b>h</b> size modifier value is equivalent to the absence of a size modifier
    in the the conversion specifier. Either one indicates the integer range to
    be stored is limited to the same range produced by the <b>int()</b> function
    of the <b>expr</b> command. The <b>L</b> size modifier is equivalent to the
    <b>l</b> size modifier. Either one indicates the integer range to be stored
    is limited to the same range produced by the <b>wide()</b> function of the
    <b>expr</b> command. The <b>ll</b> size modifier indicates that the integer
    range to be stored is unlimited.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following conversion characters are supported:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="d"><a class="permalink" href="#d"><b>d</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The input substring must be a decimal integer. It is read in and the
      integer value is stored in the variable, truncated as required by the size
      modifier value.</dd>
  <dt id="o"><a class="permalink" href="#o"><b>o</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The input substring must be an octal integer. It is read in and the
      integer value is stored in the variable, truncated as required by the size
      modifier value.</dd>
  <dt id="x"><a class="permalink" href="#x"><b>x</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The input substring must be a hexadecimal integer. It is read in and the
      integer value is stored in the variable, truncated as required by the size
      modifier value.</dd>
  <dt id="u"><a class="permalink" href="#u"><b>u</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The input substring must be a decimal integer. The integer value is
      truncated as required by the size modifier value, and the corresponding
      unsigned value for that truncated range is computed and stored in the
      variable as a decimal string. The conversion makes no sense without
      reference to a truncation range, so the size modifier <b>ll</b> is not
      permitted in combination with conversion character <b>u</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><b>i</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The input substring must be an integer. The base (i.e. decimal, binary,
      octal, or hexadecimal) is determined in the same fashion as described in
      <b>expr</b>. The integer value is stored in the variable, truncated as
      required by the size modifier value.</dd>
  <dt id="c"><a class="permalink" href="#c"><b>c</b></a></dt>
  <dd>A single character is read in and its Unicode value is stored in the
      variable as an integer value. Initial white space is not skipped in this
      case, so the input substring may be a white-space character.</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><b>s</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The input substring consists of all the characters up to the next
      white-space character; the characters are copied to the variable.</dd>
  <dt id="e"><a class="permalink" href="#e"><b>e</b> or <b>f</b> or
    <b>g</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The input substring must be a floating-point number consisting of an
      optional sign, a string of decimal digits possibly containing a decimal
      point, and an optional exponent consisting of an <b>e</b> or <b>E</b>
      followed by an optional sign and a string of decimal digits. It is read in
      and stored in the variable as a floating-point value.</dd>
  <dt><b>[</b><i>chars</i><b>]</b></dt>
  <dd>The input substring consists of one or more characters in <i>chars</i>.
      The matching string is stored in the variable. If the first character
      between the brackets is a <b>]</b> then it is treated as part of
      <i>chars</i> rather than the closing bracket for the set. If <i>chars</i>
      contains a sequence of the form <i>a</i><b>-</b><i>b</i> then any
      character between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> (inclusive) will match. If the
      first or last character between the brackets is a <b>-</b>, then it is
      treated as part of <i>chars</i> rather than indicating a range.</dd>
  <dt><b>[^</b><i>chars</i><b>]</b></dt>
  <dd>The input substring consists of one or more characters not in
      <i>chars</i>. The matching string is stored in the variable. If the
      character immediately following the <b>^</b> is a <b>]</b> then it is
      treated as part of the set rather than the closing bracket for the set. If
      <i>chars</i> contains a sequence of the form <i>a</i><b>-</b><i>b</i> then
      any character between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> (inclusive) will be excluded
      from the set. If the first or last character between the brackets is a
      <b>-</b>, then it is treated as part of <i>chars</i> rather than
      indicating a range value.</dd>
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><b>n</b></a></dt>
  <dd>No input is consumed from the input string. Instead, the total number of
      characters scanned from the input string so far is stored in the
    variable.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The number of characters read from the input for a conversion is
    the largest number that makes sense for that particular conversion (e.g. as
    many decimal digits as possible for <b>%d</b>, as many octal digits as
    possible for <b>%o</b>, and so on). The input substring for a given
    conversion terminates either when a white-space character is encountered or
    when the maximum substring width has been reached, whichever comes first. If
    a <b>*</b> is present in the conversion specifier then no variable is
    assigned and the next scan argument is not consumed.</p>

<p class="Pp">The behavior of the <b>scan</b> command is the same as the

    differences:</p>

  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd><b>%p</b> conversion specifier is not supported.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>For <b>%c</b> conversions a single character value is converted to a

      <i>varName</i>; no substring width may be specified for this
    conversion.</dd>
  <dt>[3]</dt>
  <dd>The <b>h</b> modifier is always ignored and the <b>l</b> and <b>L</b>
      modifiers are ignored when converting real values (i.e. type <b>double</b>
      is used for the internal representation). The <b>ll</b> modifier has no
      <b>sscanf</b> counterpart.</dd>
  <dt>[4]</dt>
  <dd>If the end of the input string is reached before any conversions have been
      performed and no variables are given, an empty string is returned.</dd>
