   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

<p class="Pp">docidx_lang_intro - docidx language introduction</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This document is an informal introduction to version 1 of the
    docidx markup language based on a multitude of examples. After reading this
    a writer should be ready to understand the two parts of the formal
    specification, i.e. the <i>docidx language syntax</i> specification and the
    <i>docidx language command reference</i>.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="FUNDAMENTALS"><a class="permalink" href="#FUNDAMENTALS">FUNDAMENTALS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">While the <i>docidx markup language</i> is quite similar to the
    <i>doctools markup language</i>, in the broadest terms possible, there is
    one key difference. An index consists essentially only of markup commands,
    with no plain text interspersed between them, except for whitespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each markup command is a Tcl command surrounded by a matching pair
    of <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>. Inside of these delimiters the usual rules for a
    Tcl command apply with regard to word quotation, nested commands,
    continuation lines, etc. I.e.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    ... [key {markup language}] ...
</pre>
<pre>
  ... [manpage thefile \\
          {file description}] ...
</pre>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="BASIC_STRUCTURE"><a class="permalink" href="#BASIC_STRUCTURE">BASIC
  STRUCTURE</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The most simple document which can be written in docidx is</p>
<pre>
    [index_begin GROUPTITLE TITLE]
    [index_end]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Not very useful, but valid. This also shows us that all docidx
    documents consist of only one part where we will list all keys and their
    references.</p>
<p class="Pp">A more useful index will contain at least keywords, or short
    'keys', i.e. the phrases which were indexed. So:</p>
<pre>
[index_begin GROUPTITLE TITLE]
[<b>key markup</b>]
[<b>key {semantic markup}]</b>]
[<b>key {docidx markup}</b>]
[<b>key {docidx language}</b>]
[<b>key {docidx commands}</b>]
[index_end]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In the above example the command <b>key</b> is used to declare the
    keyword phrases we wish to be part of the index.</p>
<p class="Pp">However a truly useful index does not only list the keyword
    phrases, but will also contain references to documents associated with the
    keywords. Here is a made-up index for all the manpages in the module
    <i>base64</i>:</p>
<pre>
[index_begin tcllib/base64 {De- &amp; Encoding}]
[key base64]
[<b>manpage base64</b>]
[key encoding]
[<b>manpage base64</b>]
[<b>manpage uuencode</b>]
[<b>manpage yencode</b>]
[key uuencode]
[<b>manpage uuencode</b>]
[key yEnc]
[<b>manpage yencode</b>]
[key ydecode]
[<b>manpage yencode</b>]
[key yencode]
[<b>manpage yencode</b>]
[index_end]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In the above example the command <b>manpage</b> is used to insert
    references to documents, using symbolic file names, with each command
    belonging to the last <b>key</b> command coming before it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The other command to insert references is <b>url</b>. In contrast
    to <b>manpage</b> it uses explicit (possibly format-specific) urls to
    describe the location of the referenced document. As such this command is
    intended for the creation of references to external documents which could
    not be handled in any other way.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="ADVANCED_STRUCTURE"><a class="permalink" href="#ADVANCED_STRUCTURE">ADVANCED
  STRUCTURE</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In all previous examples we fudged a bit regarding the markup
    actually allowed to be used before the <b>index_begin</b> command opening
    the document.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of only whitespace the two templating commands
    <b>include</b> and <b>vset</b> are also allowed, to enable the writer to
    either set and/or import configuration settings relevant to the table of
    contents. I.e. it is possible to write</p>
<pre>
[<b>include FILE</b>]
[<b>vset VAR VALUE</b>]
[index_begin GROUPTITLE TITLE]
[index_end]
</pre>
Even more important, these two commands are allowed anywhere where a markup
  command is allowed, without regard for any other structure.
<pre>
[index_begin GROUPTITLE TITLE]
[<b>include FILE</b>]
[<b>vset VAR VALUE</b>]
[index_end]
</pre>
The only restriction <b>include</b> has to obey is that the contents of the
  included file must be valid at the place of the inclusion. I.e. a file
  included before <b>index_begin</b> may contain only the templating commands
  <b>vset</b> and <b>include</b>, a file included after a key may contain only
  manape or url references, and other keys, etc.

<h2 class="Ss" id="ESCAPES"><a class="permalink" href="#ESCAPES">ESCAPES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Beyond the 6 commands shown so far we have two more available.
    However their function is not the marking up of index structure, but the
    insertion of characters, namely <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>. These commands,
    <b>lb</b> and <b>rb</b> respectively, are required because our use of [ and
    ] to bracket markup commands makes it impossible to directly use [ and ]
    within the text.</p>
<p class="Pp">Our example of their use are the sources of the last sentence in
    the previous paragraph, with some highlighting added.</p>
<pre>
  ...
  These commands, [cmd lb] and [cmd lb] respectively, are required
  because our use of [<b>lb</b>] and [<b>rb</b>] to bracket markup commands makes it
  impossible to directly use [<b>lb</b>] and [<b>rb</b>] within the text.

<h1 class="Sh" id="FURTHER_READING"><a class="permalink" href="#FURTHER_READING">FURTHER
  READING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Now that this document has been digested the reader, assumed to be
    a <i>writer</i> of documentation should be fortified enough to be able to
    understand the formal <i>docidx language syntax</i> specification as well.
    From here on out the <i>docidx language command reference</i> will also
    serve as the detailed specification and cheat sheet for all available
    commands and their syntax.</p>
<p class="Pp">To be able to validate a document while writing it, it is also
    recommended to familiarize oneself with Tclapps' ultra-configurable
    <b>dtp</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the other hand, docidx is perfectly suited for the automatic
    generation from doctools documents, and this is the route Tcllib's easy and
    simple <b>dtplite</b> goes, creating an index for a set of documents behind
    the scenes, without the writer having to do so on their own.</p>
