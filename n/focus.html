   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">The <b>focus</b> command is used to manage the Tk input focus. At
    any given time, one window on each display is designated as the <i>focus
    window</i>; any key press or key release events for the display are sent to
    that window. It is normally up to the window manager to redirect the focus
    among the top-level windows of a display. For example, some window managers
    automatically set the input focus to a top-level window whenever the mouse
    enters it; others redirect the input focus only when the user clicks on a
    window. Usually the window manager will set the focus only to top-level
    windows, leaving it up to the application to redirect the focus among the
    children of the top-level.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tk remembers one focus window for each top-level (the most recent
    descendant of that top-level to receive the focus); when the window manager
    gives the focus to a top-level, Tk automatically redirects it to the
    remembered window. Within a top-level Tk uses an <i>explicit</i> focus model
    by default. Moving the mouse within a top-level does not normally change the
    focus; the focus changes only when a widget decides explicitly to claim the
    focus (e.g., because of a button click), or when the user types a key such
    as Tab that moves the focus.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Tcl procedure <b>tk_focusFollowsMouse</b> may be invoked to
    create an <i>implicit</i> focus model: it reconfigures Tk so that the focus
    is set to a window whenever the mouse enters it. The Tcl procedures
    <b>tk_focusNext</b> and <b>tk_focusPrev</b> implement a focus order among
    the windows of a top-level; they are used in the default bindings for Tab
    and Shift-Tab, among other things.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>focus</b> command can take any of the following forms:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="focus"><a class="permalink" href="#focus"><b>focus</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the path name of the focus window on the display containing the
      application's main window, or an empty string if no window in this
      application has the focus on that display. Note: it is better to specify
      the display explicitly using <b>-displayof</b> (see below) so that the
      code will work in applications using multiple displays.</dd>
  <dt id="focus~2"><a class="permalink" href="#focus~2"><b>focus
    </b><i>window</i></a></dt>
  <dd>If the application currently has the input focus on <i>window</i>'s
      display, this command resets the input focus for <i>window</i>'s display
      to <i>window</i> and returns an empty string. If the application does not
      currently have the input focus on <i>window</i>'s display, <i>window</i>
      will be remembered as the focus for its top-level; the next time the focus
      arrives at the top-level, Tk will redirect it to <i>window</i>. If
      <i>window</i> is an empty string then the command does nothing.</dd>
  <dt id="focus~3"><a class="permalink" href="#focus~3"><b>focus -displayof</b>
    <i>window</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the name of the focus window on the display containing
      <i>window</i>. If the focus window for <i>window</i>'s display is not in
      this application, the return value is an empty string.</dd>
  <dt id="focus~4"><a class="permalink" href="#focus~4"><b>focus -force
    </b><i>window</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Sets the focus of <i>window</i>'s display to <i>window</i>, even if the
      application does not currently have the input focus for the display. This
      command should be used sparingly, if at all. In normal usage, an
      application should not claim the focus for itself; instead, it should wait
      for the window manager to give it the focus. If <i>window</i> is an empty
      string then the command does nothing.</dd>
  <dt id="focus~5"><a class="permalink" href="#focus~5"><b>focus -lastfor</b>
    <i>window</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the name of the most recent window to have the input focus among
      all the windows in the same top-level as <i>window</i>. If no window in
      that top-level has ever had the input focus, or if the most recent focus
      window has been deleted, then the name of the top-level is returned. The
      return value is the window that will receive the input focus the next time
      the window manager gives the focus to the top-level.</dd>
</dl>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="QUIRKS"><a class="permalink" href="#QUIRKS">QUIRKS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When an internal window receives the input focus, Tk does not
    actually set the X focus to that window; as far as X is concerned, the focus
    will stay on the top-level window containing the window with the focus.
    However, Tk generates FocusIn and FocusOut events just as if the X focus
    were on the internal window. This approach gets around a number of problems
    that would occur if the X focus were actually moved; the fact that the X
    focus is on the top-level is invisible unless you use C code to query the X
    server directly.</p>

<p class="Pp">To make a window that only participates in the focus traversal
    ring when a variable is set, add the following bindings to the widgets
    <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> it in that focus ring:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
button .before -text &quot;Before&quot;
button .middle -text &quot;Middle&quot;
button .after  -text &quot;After&quot;
checkbutton .flag -variable traverseToMiddle -takefocus 0

pack .before .middle .after
bind .before &lt;Tab&gt; {
<br/>
   if {!$traverseToMiddle} {
<br/>
      <b>focus</b> .after
<br/>
      break
<br/>
   }
}
bind .after &lt;Shift-Tab&gt; {
<br/>
   if {!$traverseToMiddle} {

      <b>focus</b> .before

      break
