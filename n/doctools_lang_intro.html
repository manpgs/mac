   The definitions below are for supplemental macros used in Tcl/Tk
   manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget.  The
  	options follow on successive lines, in four columns separated
  	by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.

</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This document is an informal introduction to version 1 of the
    doctools markup language based on a multitude of examples. After reading
    this a writer should be ready to understand the two parts of the formal
    specification, i.e. the <i>doctools language syntax</i> specification and
    the <i>doctools language command reference</i>.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="FUNDAMENTALS"><a class="permalink" href="#FUNDAMENTALS">FUNDAMENTALS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In the broadest terms possible the <i>doctools markup language</i>
    is LaTeX-like, instead of like SGML and similar languages. A document
    written in this language consists primarily of text, with markup commands
    embedded into it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each markup command is a Tcl command surrounded by a matching pair
    of <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>. Inside of these delimiters the usual rules for a
    Tcl command apply with regard to word quotation, nested commands,
    continuation lines, etc. I.e.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  ... [list_begin enumerated] ...
</pre>
<pre>
  ... [call [cmd foo] \\
          [arg bar]] ...

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="BASIC_STRUCTURE"><a class="permalink" href="#BASIC_STRUCTURE">BASIC
  STRUCTURE</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The most simple document which can be written in doctools is</p>
<pre>
    [manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
    [description]
    [manpage_end]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This also shows us that all doctools documents are split into two
    parts, the <i>header</i> and the <i>body</i>. Everything coming before
    [<b>description</b>] belongs to the header, and everything coming after
    belongs to the body, with the whole document bracketed by the two
    <b>manpage_*</b> commands. Before and after these opening and closing
    commands we have only <i>whitespace</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the remainder of this section we will discuss only the contents
    of the header, the structure of the body will be discussed in the section
    <b>Text structure</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The header section can be empty, and otherwise may contain only an
    arbitrary sequence of the four so-called <i>header</i> commands, plus
    <i>whitespace</i>. These commands are</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="titledesc"><a class="permalink" href="#titledesc"><b>titledesc</b></a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="moddesc"><a class="permalink" href="#moddesc"><b>moddesc</b></a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="require"><a class="permalink" href="#require"><b>require</b></a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="copyright"><a class="permalink" href="#copyright"><b>copyright</b></a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">They provide, through their arguments, additional information
    about the document, like its title, the title of the larger group the
    document belongs to (if applicable), the requirements of the documented
    packages (if applicable), and copyright assignments. All of them can occur
    multiple times, including none, and they can be used in any order. However
    for <b>titledesc</b> and <b>moddesc</b> only the last occurrence is taken.
    For the other two the specified information is accumulated, in the given
    order. Regular text is not allowed within the header.</p>
<p class="Pp">Given the above a less minimal example of a document is</p>
<pre>
[manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
[<b>copyright {YEAR AUTHOR}</b>]
[<b>titledesc TITLE</b>]
[<b>moddesc   MODULE_TITLE</b>]
[<b>require   PACKAGE VERSION</b>]
[<b>require   PACKAGE</b>]
[description]
[manpage_end]
</pre>
Remember that the whitespace is optional. The document
<pre>
    [manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
    [copyright {YEAR AUTHOR}][titledesc TITLE][moddesc MODULE_TITLE]
    [require PACKAGE VERSION][require PACKAGE][description]
    [manpage_end]
</pre>
has the same meaning as the example before.
<p class="Pp">On the other hand, if <i>whitespace</i> is present it consists not
    only of any sequence of characters containing the space character,
    horizontal and vertical tabs, carriage return, and newline, but it may
    contain comment markup as well, in the form of the <b>comment</b>
  command.</p>
<pre>
[<b>comment { ... }</b>]
[manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
[copyright {YEAR AUTHOR}]
[titledesc TITLE]
[moddesc   MODULE_TITLE][<b>comment { ... }</b>]
[require   PACKAGE VERSION]

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="ADVANCED_STRUCTURE"><a class="permalink" href="#ADVANCED_STRUCTURE">ADVANCED
  STRUCTURE</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In the simple examples of the last section we fudged a bit
    regarding the markup actually allowed to be used before the
    <b>manpage_begin</b> command opening the document.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of only whitespace the two templating commands
    <b>include</b> and <b>vset</b> are also allowed, to enable the writer to
    either set and/or import configuration settings relevant to the document.
    I.e. it is possible to write</p>
<pre>
[<b>include FILE</b>]
[<b>vset VAR VALUE</b>]
[manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
[description]
[manpage_end]
</pre>
Even more important, these two commands are allowed anywhere where a markup
  command is allowed, without regard for any other structure. I.e. for example
  in the header as well.
<pre>
[manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
[<b>include FILE</b>]
[<b>vset VAR VALUE</b>]
[description]
[manpage_end]
</pre>
The only restriction <b>include</b> has to obey is that the contents of the
  included file must be valid at the place of the inclusion. I.e. a file
  included before <b>manpage_begin</b> may contain only the templating commands
  <b>vset</b> and <b>include</b>, a file included in the header may contain only
  header commands, etc.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="TEXT_STRUCTURE"><a class="permalink" href="#TEXT_STRUCTURE">TEXT
  STRUCTURE</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The body of the document consists mainly of text, possibly split
    into sections, subsections, and paragraphs, with parts marked up to
    highlight various semantic categories of text, and additional structure
    through the use of examples and (nested) lists.</p>
<p class="Pp">This section explains the high-level structural commands, with
    everything else deferred to the following sections.</p>
<p class="Pp">The simplest way of structuring the body is through the
    introduction of paragraphs. The command for doing so is <b>para</b>. Each
    occurrence of this command closes the previous paragraph and automatically
    opens the next. The first paragraph is automatically opened at the beginning
    of the body, by <b>description</b>. In the same manner the last paragraph
    automatically ends at <b>manpage_end</b>.</p>
<pre>
[manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
[description]
 ...
[<b>para</b>]
 ...
[<b>para</b>]
 ...
[manpage_end]
</pre>
Empty paragraphs are ignored.
<p class="Pp">A structure coarser than paragraphs are sections, which allow the
    writer to split a document into larger, and labeled, pieces. The command for
    doing so is <b>section</b>. Each occurrence of this command closes the
    previous section and automatically opens the next, including its first
    paragraph. The first section is automatically opened at the beginning of the
    body, by <b>description</b> (This section is labeled
    &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot;). In the same manner the last section automatically
    ends at <b>manpage_end</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Empty sections are <i>not</i> ignored. We are free to (not) use
    paragraphs within sections.</p>
<pre>
[manpage_begin NAME SECTION VERSION]
[description]
 ...
[<b>section {Section A}</b>]
 ...
[para]
 ...
[<b>section {Section B}</b>]
 ...
[manpage_end]
</pre>
Between sections and paragraphs we have subsections, to split sections. The
  command for doing so is <b>subsection</b>. Each occurrence of this command
  closes the previous subsection and automatically opens the next, including its
  first paragraph. A subsection is automatically opened at the beginning of the
  body, by <b>description</b>, and at the beginning of each section. In the same
  manner the last subsection automatically ends at <b>manpage_end</b>.
<p class="Pp">Empty subsections are <i>not</i> ignored. We are free to (not) use
    paragraphs within subsections.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="TEXT_MARKUP"><a class="permalink" href="#TEXT_MARKUP">TEXT
  MARKUP</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Having handled the overall structure a writer can impose on the
    document we now take a closer at the text in a paragraph.</p>
<p class="Pp">While most often this is just the unadorned content of the
    document we do have situations where we wish to highlight parts of it as
    some type of thing or other, like command arguments, command names,
    concepts, uris, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">For this we have a series of markup commands which take the text
    to highlight as their single argument. It should be noted that while their
    predominant use is the highlighting of parts of a paragraph they can also be
    used to mark up the arguments of list item commands, and of other markup
    commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">The commands available to us are</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="arg"><a class="permalink" href="#arg"><b>arg</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Its argument is a the name of a command argument.</dd>
  <dt id="class"><a class="permalink" href="#class"><b>class</b></a></dt>

  <dt id="package"><a class="permalink" href="#package"><b>package</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Its argument is a package name.</dd>
  <dt id="sectref"><a class="permalink" href="#sectref"><b>sectref</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Its argument is the title of a section or subsection, i.e. a section
      reference.</dd>
  <dt id="syscmd"><a class="permalink" href="#syscmd"><b>syscmd</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Its argument is a command name (external, system command).</dd>
  <dt id="term"><a class="permalink" href="#term"><b>term</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Its argument is a concept, or general terminology.</dd>
  <dt id="type"><a class="permalink" href="#type"><b>type</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Its argument is a type name.</dd>
  <dt id="uri"><a class="permalink" href="#uri"><b>uri</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Its argument is a uniform resource identifier, i.e an external reference.
      A second argument can be used to specify an explicit label for the
      reference in question.</dd>
  <dt id="usage"><a class="permalink" href="#usage"><b>usage</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The arguments describe the syntax of a Tcl command.</dd>
  <dt id="var"><a class="permalink" href="#var"><b>var</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Its argument is a variable.</dd>
  <dt id="widget"><a class="permalink" href="#widget"><b>widget</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Its argument is a widget name.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The example demonstrating the use of text markup is an excerpt
    from the <i>doctools language command reference</i>, with some highlighting
    added. It shows their use within a block of text, as the arguments of a list
    item command (<b>call</b>), and our ability to nest them.</p>
<pre>
  ...
  [call [<b>cmd arg_def</b>] [<b>arg type</b>] [<b>arg name</b>]] [<b>opt</b> [<b>arg mode</b>]]]
  Text structure. List element. Argument list. Automatically closes the
  previous list element. Specifies the data-[<b>arg type</b>] of the described
  argument of a command, its [<b>arg name</b>] and its i/o-[<b>arg mode</b>]. The
  latter is optional.

<h2 class="Ss" id="ESCAPES"><a class="permalink" href="#ESCAPES">ESCAPES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Beyond the 20 commands for simple markup shown in the previous
    section we have two more available which are technically simple markup.
    However their function is not the marking up of phrases as specific types of
    things, but the insertion of characters, namely <b>[</b> and <b>]</b>. These
    commands, <b>lb</b> and <b>rb</b> respectively, are required because our use
    of [ and ] to bracket markup commands makes it impossible to directly use [
    and ] within the text.</p>
<p class="Pp">Our example of their use are the sources of the last sentence in
    the previous paragraph, with some highlighting added.</p>
<pre>
  ...

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="CROSS-REFERENCES"><a class="permalink" href="#CROSS-REFERENCES">CROSS-REFERENCES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The last two commands we have to discuss are for the declaration
    of cross-references between documents, explicit and implicit. They are
    <b>keywords</b> and <b>see_also</b>. Both take an arbitrary number of
    arguments, all of which have to be plain unmarked text. I.e. it is not
    allowed to use markup on them. Both commands can be used multiple times in a
    document. If that is done all arguments of all occurrences of one of them
    are put together into a single set.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="keywords"><a class="permalink" href="#keywords"><b>keywords</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The arguments of this command are interpreted as keywords describing the
      document. A processor can use this information to create an index
      indirectly linking the containing document to all documents with the same
      keywords.</dd>
  <dt id="see_also"><a class="permalink" href="#see_also"><b>see_also</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The arguments of this command are interpreted as references to other
      documents. A processor can format them as direct links to these
    documents.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">All the cross-reference commands can occur anywhere in the
    document between <b>manpage_begin</b> and <b>manpage_end</b>. As such the
    writer can choose whether she wants to have them at the beginning of the
    body, or at its end, maybe near the place a keyword is actually defined by
    the main content, or considers them as meta data which should be in the
    header, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">Our example shows the sources for the cross-references of this
    document, with some highlighting added. Incidentally they are found at the
    end of the body.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Where ever we can write plain text we can write examples too. For
    simple examples we have the command <b>example</b> which takes a single
    argument, the text of the argument. The example text must not contain
    markup. If we wish to have markup within an example we have to use the
    2-command combination <b>example_begin</b> / <b>example_end</b> instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first opens an example block, the other closes it, and in
    between we can write plain text and use all the regular text markup
    commands. Note that text structure commands are not allowed. This also means
    that it is not possible to embed examples and lists within an example. On
    the other hand, we <i>can</i> use templating commands within example blocks
    to read their contents from a file (Remember section <b>Advanced
    structure</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The source for the very first example in this document (see
    section <b>Fundamentals</b>), with some highlighting added, is</p>
<pre>
  [<b>example</b> {
    ... [list_begin enumerated] ...
  }]
</pre>
Using <b>example_begin</b> / <b>example_end</b> this would look like
<pre>
  [<b>example_begin</b>]
    ... [list_begin enumerated] ...
  [<b>example_end</b>]
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="LISTS"><a class="permalink" href="#LISTS">LISTS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Where ever we can write plain text we can write lists too. The
    main commands are <b>list_begin</b> to start a list, and <b>list_end</b> to
    close one. The opening command takes an argument specifying the type of list
    started it, and this in turn determines which of the eight existing list
    item commands are allowed within the list to start list items.</p>
<p class="Pp">After the opening command only whitespace is allowed, until the
    first list item command opens the first item of the list. Each item is a
    regular series of paragraphs and is closed by either the next list item
    command, or the end of the list. If closed by a list item command this
    command automatically opens the next list item. A consequence of a list item
    being a series of paragraphs is that all regular text markup can be used
    within a list item, including examples and other lists.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list types recognized by <b>list_begin</b> and their
    associated list item commands are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="arguments"><a class="permalink" href="#arguments"><b>arguments</b></a></dt>
  <dd>(<b>arg_def</b>) This opens an <i>argument (declaration) list</i>. It is a

      name.</dd>
  <dt id="definitions"><a class="permalink" href="#definitions"><b>definitions</b></a></dt>
  <dd>(<b>def</b> and <b>call</b>) This opens a general <i>term definition
      list</i>. The terms defined by the list items are specified through the
      argument(s) of the list item commands, either general terms, possibly with
      markup (<b>def</b>), or Tcl commands with their syntax (<b>call</b>).</dd>
  <dt id="enumerated"><a class="permalink" href="#enumerated"><b>enumerated</b></a></dt>
  <dd>(<b>enum</b>) This opens a general <i>enumerated list</i>.</dd>

  <dt id="options"><a class="permalink" href="#options"><b>options</b></a></dt>
  <dd>(<b>opt_def</b>) This opens an <i>option (declaration) list</i>. It is a

      name, possibly with the option's arguments.</dd>
  <dt id="tkoptions"><a class="permalink" href="#tkoptions"><b>tkoptions</b></a></dt>
  <dd>(<b>tkoption_def</b>) This opens a <i>widget option (declaration)
      list</i>. It is a specialized form of a term definition list where the
      term is the name of a configuration option for a widget, with its name and
      class in the option database.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Our example is the source of the definition list in the previous
    paragraph, with most of the content in the middle removed.</p>
<pre>
  ...
  [<b>list_begin</b> definitions]
  [<b>def</b> [const arg]]
  ([cmd arg_def]) This opens an argument (declaration) list. It is a
  specialized form of a definition list where the term is an argument
  name, with its type and i/o-mode.
  [<b>def</b> [const itemized]]
  ([cmd item])
  This opens a general itemized list.
  ...
  [<b>def</b> [const tkoption]]
  ([cmd tkoption_def]) This opens a widget option (declaration) list. It

  of a configuration option for a widget, with its name and class in the
  option database.
  [<b>list_end</b>]
  ...

Note that a list cannot begin in one (sub)section and end in another.
  Differently said, (sub)section breaks are not allowed within lists and list
  items. An example of this <i>illegal</i> construct is

<p class="Pp">Now that this document has been digested the reader, assumed to be
