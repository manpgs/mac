<p class="Pp"><b>glUseProgram</b> installs the program object specified by
    <i>program</i> as part of current rendering state. One or more executables
    are created in a program object by successfully attaching shader objects to
    it with <b>glAttachShader</b>(), successfully compiling the shader objects
    with <b>glCompileShader</b>(), and successfully linking the program object
    with <b>glLinkProgram</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp">A program object will contain an executable that will run on the
    vertex processor if it contains one or more shader objects of type
    <b>GL_VERTEX_SHADER</b> that have been successfully compiled and linked. A
    program object will contain an executable that will run on the geometry
    processor if it contains one or more shader objects of type
    <b>GL_GEOMETRY_SHADER</b> that have been successfully compiled and linked.
    Similarly, a program object will contain an executable that will run on the
    fragment processor if it contains one or more shader objects of type
    <b>GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER</b> that have been successfully compiled and
  linked.</p>
<p class="Pp">While a program object is in use, applications are free to modify
    attached shader objects, compile attached shader objects, attach additional
    shader objects, and detach or delete shader objects. None of these
    operations will affect the executables that are part of the current state.
    However, relinking the program object that is currently in use will install
    the program object as part of the current rendering state if the link
    operation was successful (see <b>glLinkProgram</b>() ). If the program
    object currently in use is relinked unsuccessfully, its link status will be
    set to <b>GL_FALSE</b>, but the executables and associated state will remain
    part of the current state until a subsequent call to <b>glUseProgram</b>
    removes it from use. After it is removed from use, it cannot be made part of
    current state until it has been successfully relinked.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>program</i> is zero, then the current rendering state refers
    to an <i>invalid</i> program object and the results of shader execution are
    undefined. However, this is not an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>program</i> does not contain shader objects of type
    <b>GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER</b>, an executable will be installed on the vertex,
    and possibly geometry processors, but the results of fragment shader
    execution will be undefined.</p>

<p class="Pp">Like buffer and texture objects, the name space for program
    objects may be shared across a set of contexts, as long as the server sides
    of the contexts share the same address space. If the name space is shared
    across contexts, any attached objects and the data associated with those
    attached objects are shared as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">Applications are responsible for providing the synchronization
    across API calls when objects are accessed from different execution
  threads.</p>

    a program object.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>GL_INVALID_OPERATION</b> is generated if <i>program</i> could

    mode is active.</p>
