<p class="Pp">Yes please.</p>
<p class="Pp">We would like all code to be fully prototyped.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your code compiles cleanly with <code class="Nm">cc</code>
    <var class="Ar">-Wall</var> we would feel happy about it. It is important to
    understand that this isn't a question of just shutting up
    <code class="Nm">cc</code>, it is a question about avoiding the things it
    complains about. To put it bluntly, don't hide the problem by casting and
    other obfuscating practices, solve the problem.</p>

<p class="Pp">Believe it or not, there actually exists a guide for indentation
    and style. It isn't generally applied though.</p>
<p class="Pp">We would appreciate if people would pay attention to it, and at
    least not violate it blatantly.</p>
<p class="Pp">We don't mind it too badly if you have your own style, but please
    make sure we can read it too.</p>
<p class="Pp">Please take time to read

<p class="Pp">Some general rules exist:</p>
<ol class="Bl-enum">
  <li>If a function is meant as a debugging aid in DDB, it should be enclosed in
    <div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
    <pre>#ifdef DDB

#endif /* DDB */</pre>
    </div>
    <p class="Pp">And the name of the procedure should start with the prefix
        <code class="Li">DDB_</code> to clearly identify the procedure as a
        debugger routine.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SCOPE_OF_SYMBOLS"><a class="permalink" href="#SCOPE_OF_SYMBOLS">SCOPE
  OF SYMBOLS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">It is important to carefully consider the scope of symbols in the
    kernel. The default is to make everything static, unless some reason
    requires the opposite.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are several reasons for this policy, the main one is that
    the kernel is one monolithic name-space, and pollution is not a good idea
    here either.</p>
<p class="Pp">For device drivers and other modules that don't add new internal
    interfaces to the kernel, the entire source should be in one file if
    possible. That way all symbols can be made static.</p>
<p class="Pp">If for some reason a module is split over multiple source files,
    then try to split the module along some major fault-line and consider using
    the number of global symbols as your guide. The fewer the better.</p>
