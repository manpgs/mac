<p class="Pp">Git will sometimes need credentials from the user in order to
    perform operations; for example, it may need to ask for a username and
    password in order to access a remote repository over HTTP. This manual
    describes the mechanisms Git uses to request these credentials, as well as
    some features to avoid inputting these credentials repeatedly.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="REQUESTING_CREDENTIALS"><a class="permalink" href="#REQUESTING_CREDENTIALS">REQUESTING
  CREDENTIALS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Without any credential helpers defined, Git will try the following
    strategies to ask the user for usernames and passwords:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.If the <b>GIT_ASKPASS</b> environment variable is set,
  the program specified by the variable is invoked. A suitable prompt is
  provided to the program on the command line, and the user&#x2019;s input is
  read from its standard output.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Otherwise, if the <b>core.askPass</b> configuration
  variable is set, its value is used as above.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Otherwise, if the <b>SSH_ASKPASS</b> environment
  variable is set, its value is used as above.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.Otherwise, the user is prompted on the terminal.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="AVOIDING_REPETITION"><a class="permalink" href="#AVOIDING_REPETITION">AVOIDING
  REPETITION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">It can be cumbersome to input the same credentials over and over.
    Git provides two methods to reduce this annoyance:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.Static configuration of usernames for a given
  authentication context.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Credential helpers to cache or store passwords, or to
  interact with a system password wallet or keychain.</div>
<p class="Pp">The first is simple and appropriate if you do not have secure
    storage available for a password. It is generally configured by adding this
    to your config:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
[credential &quot;https://example.com&quot;]
        username = me
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Credential helpers, on the other hand, are external programs from
    which Git can request both usernames and passwords; they typically interface
    with secure storage provided by the OS or other programs.</p>
<p class="Pp">To use a helper, you must first select one to use. Git currently
    includes the following helpers:</p>
<p class="Pp">cache</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Cache credentials in memory for a short period of time.
  See <b>git-credential-cache</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">store</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Store credentials indefinitely on disk. See
  <b>git-credential-store</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">You may also have third-party helpers installed; search for
    <b>credential-*</b> in the output of <b>git help -a</b>, and consult the
    documentation of individual helpers. Once you have selected a helper, you
    can tell Git to use it by putting its name into the credential.helper
    variable.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.Find a helper.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git help -a | grep credential-
credential-foo
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Read its description.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git help credential-foo
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Tell Git to use it.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git config --global credential.helper foo
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CREDENTIAL_CONTEXTS"><a class="permalink" href="#CREDENTIAL_CONTEXTS">CREDENTIAL
  CONTEXTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Git considers each credential to have a context defined by a URL.
    This context is used to look up context-specific configuration, and is
    passed to any helpers, which may use it as an index into secure storage.</p>
<p class="Pp">For instance, imagine we are accessing
    <b>https://example.com/foo.git</b>. When Git looks into a config file to see
    if a section matches this context, it will consider the two a match if the
    context is a more-specific subset of the pattern in the config file. For
    example, if you have this in your config file:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
[credential &quot;https://example.com&quot;]
        username = foo
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">then we will match: both protocols are the same, both hosts are
    the same, and the &quot;pattern&quot; URL does not care about the path
    component at all. However, this context would not match:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
[credential &quot;https://kernel.org&quot;]
        username = foo
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">because the hostnames differ. Nor would it match
    <b>foo.example.com</b>; Git compares hostnames exactly, without considering
    whether two hosts are part of the same domain. Likewise, a config entry for
    <b>http://example.com</b> would not match: Git compares the protocols
    exactly. However, you may use wildcards in the domain name and other pattern
    matching techniques as with the <b>http.&lt;url&gt;.*</b> options.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the &quot;pattern&quot; URL does include a path component, then
    this too must match exactly: the context
    <b>https://example.com/bar/baz.git</b> will match a config entry for
    <b>https://example.com/bar/baz.git</b> (in addition to matching the config
    entry for <b>https://example.com</b>) but will not match a config entry for
    <b>https://example.com/bar</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION_OPTIONS">CONFIGURATION
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Options for a credential context can be configured either in
    <b>credential.*</b> (which applies to all credentials), or
    <b>credential.&lt;url&gt;.*</b>, where &lt;url&gt; matches the context as
    described above.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following options are available in either location:</p>
<p class="Pp">helper</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The name of an external credential helper, and any
  associated options. If the helper name is not an absolute path, then the
  string <b>git credential-</b> is prepended. The resulting string is executed
  by the shell (so, for example, setting this to <b>foo --option=bar</b> will
  execute <b>git credential-foo --option=bar</b> via the shell. See the manual
  of specific helpers for examples of their use.
<p class="Pp">If there are multiple instances of the <b>credential.helper</b>
    configuration variable, each helper will be tried in turn, and may provide a
    username, password, or nothing. Once Git has acquired both a username and a
    password, no more helpers will be tried.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>credential.helper</b> is configured to the empty string,
    this resets the helper list to empty (so you may override a helper set by a
    lower-priority config file by configuring the empty-string helper, followed
    by whatever set of helpers you would like).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">username</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A default username, if one is not provided in the
  URL.</div>
<p class="Pp">useHttpPath</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, Git does not consider the &quot;path&quot;
  component of an http URL to be worth matching via external helpers. This means
  that a credential stored for <b>https://example.com/foo.git</b> will also be
  used for <b>https://example.com/bar.git</b>. If you do want to distinguish
  these cases, set this option to <b>true</b>.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CUSTOM_HELPERS"><a class="permalink" href="#CUSTOM_HELPERS">CUSTOM
  HELPERS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">You can write your own custom helpers to interface with any system
    in which you keep credentials.</p>
<p class="Pp">Credential helpers are programs executed by Git to fetch or save
    credentials from and to long-term storage (where &quot;long-term&quot; is
    simply longer than a single Git process; e.g., credentials may be stored
    in-memory for a few minutes, or indefinitely on disk).</p>
<p class="Pp">Each helper is specified by a single string in the configuration
    variable <b>credential.helper</b> (and others, see <b>git-config</b>(1)).
    The string is transformed by Git into a command to be executed using these
    rules:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.If the helper string begins with &quot;!&quot;, it is
  considered a shell snippet, and everything after the &quot;!&quot; becomes the
  command.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Otherwise, if the helper string begins with an
  absolute path, the verbatim helper string becomes the command.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Otherwise, the string &quot;git credential-&quot; is
  prepended to the helper string, and the result becomes the command.</div>
<p class="Pp">The resulting command then has an &quot;operation&quot; argument
    appended to it (see below for details), and the result is executed by the
    shell.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here are some example specifications:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
# run &quot;git credential-foo&quot;
[credential]
        helper = foo
# same as above, but pass an argument to the helper
[credential]
        helper = &quot;foo --bar=baz&quot;
# the arguments are parsed by the shell, so use shell
# quoting if necessary
[credential]
        helper = &quot;foo --bar='whitespace arg'&quot;
# you can also use an absolute path, which will not use the git wrapper
[credential]
        helper = &quot;/path/to/my/helper --with-arguments&quot;
# or you can specify your own shell snippet
[credential &quot;https://example.com&quot;]
        username = your_user
        helper = &quot;!f() { test \&quot;$1\&quot; = get &amp;&amp; echo \&quot;password=$(cat $HOME/.secret)\&quot;; }; f&quot;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Generally speaking, rule (3) above is the simplest for users to
    specify. Authors of credential helpers should make an effort to assist their
    users by naming their program &quot;git-credential-$NAME&quot;, and putting
    it in the <b>$PATH</b> or <b>$GIT_EXEC_PATH</b> during installation, which
    will allow a user to enable it with <b>git config credential.helper
    $NAME</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a helper is executed, it will have one &quot;operation&quot;
    argument appended to its command line, which is one of:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>get</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Return a matching credential, if any exists.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>store</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Store the credential, if applicable to the helper.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>erase</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Remove a matching credential, if any, from the
  helper&#x2019;s storage.</div>
<p class="Pp">The details of the credential will be provided on the
    helper&#x2019;s stdin stream. The exact format is the same as the
    input/output format of the <b>git credential</b> plumbing command (see the
    section <b>INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT</b> in <b>git-credential</b>(1) for a
    detailed specification).</p>
<p class="Pp">For a <b>get</b> operation, the helper should produce a list of
    attributes on stdout in the same format (see <b>git-credential</b>(1) for
    common attributes). A helper is free to produce a subset, or even no values
    at all if it has nothing useful to provide. Any provided attributes will
    overwrite those already known about by Git&#x2019;s credential
  subsystem.</p>
<p class="Pp">While it is possible to override all attributes, well behaving
    helpers should refrain from doing so for any attribute other than username
    and password.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a helper outputs a <b>quit</b> attribute with a value of
    <b>true</b> or <b>1</b>, no further helpers will be consulted, nor will the
    user be prompted (if no credential has been provided, the operation will
    then fail).</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, no more helpers will be consulted once both username
    and password had been provided.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a <b>store</b> or <b>erase</b> operation, the helper&#x2019;s
    output is ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a helper fails to perform the requested operation or needs to
    notify the user of a potential issue, it may write to stderr.</p>
<p class="Pp">If it does not support the requested operation (e.g., a read-only
    store), it should silently ignore the request.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a helper receives any other operation, it should silently
    ignore the request. This leaves room for future operations to be added
    (older helpers will just ignore the new requests).</p>
