<p class="Pp"><i>roff</i> is the general name for a set of type-setting
    programs, known under names like <i>troff</i>, <i>nroff</i>, <i>ditroff</i>,
    <i>groff</i>, etc. A roff type-setting system consists of an extensible text
    formatting language and a set of programs for printing and converting to
    other text formats. Traditionally, it is the main text processing system of
    Unix; every Unix-like operating system still distributes a roff system as a
    core package.</p>
<p class="Pp">The most common roff system today is the free software
    implementation <i>GNU roff</i>, <b>groff</b>(1). The pre-groff
    implementations are referred to as <i>classical</i> (dating back as long as
    1973). <i>groff</i> implements the look-and-feel and functionality of its
    classical ancestors, but has many extensions. As <i>groff</i> is the only
    roff system that is available for every (or almost every) computer system it
    is the de-facto roff standard today.</p>
<p class="Pp">In some ancient Unix systems, there was a binary called
    <b>roff</b> that implemented the even more ancient <b>runoff</b> of the
    <i>Multics</i> operating system, cf. section <b>HISTORY</b>. The
    functionality of this program was very restricted even in comparison to
    ancient troff; it is not supported any longer. Consequently, in this
    document, the term <i>roff</i> always refers to the general meaning of
    <i>roff system</i>, not to the ancient roff binary.</p>
<p class="Pp">In spite of its age, roff is in wide use today, for example, the
    manual pages on UNIX systems (<i>man&#x00A0;pages</i>), many software books,
    system documentation, standards, and corporate documents are written in
    roff. The roff output for text devices is still unmatched, and its graphical
    output has the same quality as other free type-setting programs and is
    better than some of the commercial systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">The most popular application of roff is the concept of <i>manual
    pages</i> or shortly <i>man pages</i>; this is the standard documentation
    system on many operating systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">This document describes the historical facts around the
    development of the <i>roff system</i>; some usage aspects common to all roff
    versions, details on the roff pipeline, which is usually hidden behind
    front-ends like <b>groff</b>(1); an general overview of the formatting
    language; some tips for editing roff files; and many pointers to further
    readings.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="HISTORY"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>roff</i> text processing system has a very long history,
    dating back to the 1960s. The roff system itself is intimately connected to
    the Unix operating system, but its roots go back to the earlier operating
    systems CTSS and Multics.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Predecessor_runoff"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Predecessor_runoff">The
  Predecessor runoff</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The evolution of <i>roff</i> is intimately related to the history
    of the operating systems. Its predecessor <b>runoff</b> was written by
    <i>Jerry Saltzer</i> on the <i>CTSS</i> operating system (<i>Compatible Time
    Sharing System</i>) as early as 1961. When CTSS was further developed into
    the operating system the famous predecessor of Unix from 1963, <i>runoff</i>
    became the main format for documentation and text processing. Both operating
    systems could only be run on very expensive computers at that time, so they
    were mostly used in research and for official and military tasks.</p>
<p class="Pp">The possibilities of the <i>runoff</i> language were quite limited
    as compared to modern roff. Only text output was possible in the 1960s. This
    could be implemented by a set of requests of length&#x00A0;2, many of which
    are still identically used in roff. The language was modelled according to
    the habits of typesetting in the pre-computer age, where lines starting with
    a dot were used in manuscripts to denote formatting requests to the person
    who would perform the typesetting manually later on.</p>
<p class="Pp">The runoff program was written in the <i>PL/1</i> language first,
    later on in <i>BCPL</i>, the grandmother of the <i>C</i>&#x00A0;programming
    language. In the Multics operating system, the help system was handled by
    runoff, similar to roff's task to manage the Unix manual pages. There are
    still documents written in the runoff language; for examples see Saltzer's
    home page, cf. section <b>SEE ALSO</b>.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Classical_nroff/troff_System"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Classical_nroff/troff_System">The
  Classical nroff/troff System</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In the 1970s, the Multics off-spring <i>Unix</i> became more and
    more popular because it could be run on affordable machines and was easily
    available for universities at that time. At MIT (the Massachusetts Institute
    of Technology), there was a need to drive the Wang <i>Graphic Systems
    CAT</i> typesetter, a graphical output device from a PDP-11 computer running
    Unix. As runoff was too limited for this task it was further developed into
    a more powerful text formatting system by <i>Josef F. Osanna</i>, a main
    developer of the Multics operating system and programmer of several runoff
    ports.</p>
<p class="Pp">The name <i>runoff</i> was shortened to <i>roff</i>. The greatly
    enlarged language of Osanna's concept included already all elements of a
    full <i>roff system</i>. All modern roff systems try to implement
    compatibility to this system. So Joe Osanna can be called the father of all
    roff systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">This first <i>roff system</i> had three formatter programs.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="troff"><a class="permalink" href="#troff"><b>troff</b></a></dt>
  <dd>(<i>typesetter roff</i>) generated a graphical output for the <i>CAT</i>
      typesetter as its only device.</dd>
  <dt id="nroff"><a class="permalink" href="#nroff"><b>nroff</b></a></dt>
  <dd>produced text output suitable for terminals and line printers.</dd>
  <dt id="roff"><a class="permalink" href="#roff"><b>roff</b></a></dt>
  <dd>was the reimplementation of the former runoff program with its limited
      features; this program was abandoned in later versions. Today, the name
      <i>roff</i> is used to refer to a troff/nroff sytem as a whole.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Osanna first version was written in the PDP-11 assembly language
    and released in 1973. <i>Brian Kernighan</i> joined the <i>roff</i>
    development by rewriting it in the C&#x00A0;programming language. The
    C&#x00A0;version was released in 1975.</p>
<p class="Pp">The syntax of the formatting language of the
    <b>nroff</b>/<b>troff</b> programs was documented in the famous <i>Troff
    User's Manual [CSTR&#x00A0;#54]</i>, first published in 1976, with further
    revisions up to 1992 by Brian Kernighan. This document is the specification
    of the <i>classical troff</i>. All later <i>roff</i> systems tried to
    establish compatibility with this specification.</p>
<p class="Pp">After Osanna had died in 1977 by a heart-attack at the age of
    about&#x00A0;50, Kernighan went on with developing troff. The next milestone
    was to equip troff with a general interface to support more devices, the
    intermediate output format and the postprocessor system. This completed the
    structure of a <i>roff system</i> as it is still in use today; see section
    <b>USING ROFF</b>. In 1979, these novelties were described in the paper
    <i>[CSTR&#x00A0;#97]</i>. This new troff version is the basis for all
    existing newer troff systems, including <i>groff</i>. On some systems, this
    <i>device independent troff</i> got a binary of its own, called
    <b>ditroff</b>(7). All modern <b>troff</b> programs already provide the full
    ditroff capabilities automatically.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Commercialization"><a class="permalink" href="#Commercialization">Commercialization</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A major degradation occurred when the easily available
    Unix&#x00A0;7 operating system was commercialized. A whole bunch of
    divergent operating systems emerged, fighting each other with
    incompatibilities in their extensions. Luckily, the incompatibilities did
    not fight the original troff. All of the different commercial roff systems
    made heavy use of Osanna/Kernighan's open source code and documentation, but
    sold them as &#x201C;their&#x201D; system &#x2014; with only minor
    additions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The source code of both the ancient Unix and classical troff
    weren't available for two decades. Fortunately, Caldera bought SCO UNIX in
    2001. In the following, Caldera made the ancient source code accessible
    on-line for non-commercial use, cf. section <b>SEE ALSO</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Free_roff"><a class="permalink" href="#Free_roff">Free
  roff</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">None of the commercial roff systems could attain the status of a
    successor for the general roff development. Everyone was only interested in
    their own stuff. This led to a steep downfall of the once excellent Unix
    operating system during the 1980s.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a counter-measure to the galopping commercialization, AT&amp;T
    Bell Labs tried to launch a rescue project with their <i>Plan&#x00A0;9</i>
    operating system. It is freely available for non-commercial use, even the
    source code, but has a proprietary license that impedes the free
    development. This concept is outdated, so Plan&#x00A0;9 was not accepted as
    a platform to bundle the main-stream development.</p>
<p class="Pp">The only remedy came from the emerging free operatings systems
    (386BSD, GNU/Linux, etc.) and software projects during the 1980s and 1990s.
    These implemented the ancient Unix features and many extensions, such that
    the old experience is not lost. In the 21st century, Unix-like systems are
    again a major factor in computer industry &#x2014; thanks to free
  software.</p>
<p class="Pp">The most important free roff project was the GNU port of troff,
    created by James Clark and put under the It was called <i>groff</i> (<i>GNU
    roff</i>). See <b>groff</b>(1) for an overview.</p>
<p class="Pp">The groff system is still actively developed. It is compatible to
    the classical troff, but many extensions were added. It is the first roff
    system that is available on almost all operating systems &#x2014; and it is
    free. This makes groff the de-facto roff standard today.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="USING_ROFF"><a class="permalink" href="#USING_ROFF">USING
  ROFF</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Most people won't even notice that they are actually using roff.
    When you read a system manual page (man page) roff is working in the
    background. Roff documents can be viewed with a native viewer called
    <b>xditview</b>(1x), a standard program of the X window distribution, see
    <b>X</b>(7x). But using roff explicitly isn't difficult either.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some roff implementations provide wrapper programs that make it
    easy to use the roff system on the shell command line. For example, the GNU
    roff implementation <b>groff</b>(1) provides command line options to avoid
    the long command pipes of classical troff; a program <b>grog</b>(1) tries to
    guess from the document which arguments should be used for a run of groff;
    people who do not like specifying command line options should try the
    <b>groffer</b>(1) program for graphically displaying groff files and man
    pages.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_roff_Pipe"><a class="permalink" href="#The_roff_Pipe">The
  roff Pipe</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Each roff system consists of preprocessors, roff formatter
    programs, and a set of device postprocessors. This concept makes heavy use
    of the <i>piping</i> mechanism, that is, a series of programs is called one
    after the other, where the output of each program in the queue is taken as
    the input for the next program.</p>
<p class="Pp">\</p>
<p class="Pp">\)\$*</p>
<p class="Pp">The preprocessors generate roff code that is fed into a roff
    formatter (e.g. troff), which in turn generates <i>intermediate output</i>
    that is fed into a device postprocessor program for printing or final
    output.</p>
<p class="Pp">All of these parts use programming languages of their own; each
    language is totally unrelated to the other parts. Moreover, roff macro
    packages that were tailored for special purposes can be included.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most roff documents use the macros of some package, intermixed
    with code for one or more preprocessors, spiced with some elements from the
    plain roff language. The full power of the roff formatting language is
    seldom needed by users; only programmers of macro packages need to know
    about the gory details.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Preprocessors"><a class="permalink" href="#Preprocessors">Preprocessors</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A roff preprocessor is any program that generates output that
    syntactically obeys the rules of the roff formatting language. Each
    preprocessor defines a language of its own that is translated into roff code
    when run through the preprocessor program. Parts written in these languages
    may be included within a roff document; they are identified by special roff
    requests or macros. Each document that is enhanced by preprocessor code must
    be run through all corresponding preprocessors before it is fed into the
    actual roff formatter program, for the formatter just ignores all alien
    code. The preprocessor programs extract and transform only the document
    parts that are determined for them.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are a lot of free and commercial roff preprocessors. Some of
    them aren't available on each system, but there is a small set of
    preprocessors that are considered as an integral part of each roff system.
    The classical preprocessors are</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Formatter_Programs"><a class="permalink" href="#Formatter_Programs">Formatter
  Programs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A <i>roff formatter</i> is a program that parses documents written
    in the roff formatting language or uses some of the roff macro packages. It
    generates <i>intermediate output</i>, which is intended to be fed into a
    single device postprocessor that must be specified by a command-line option
    to the formatter program. The documents must have been run through all
    necessary preprocessors before.</p>
<p class="Pp">The output produced by a roff formatter is represented in yet
    another language, the <i>intermediate output format</i> or <i>troff
    output</i>. This language was first specified in <i>[CSTR&#x00A0;#97]</i>;
    its GNU extension is documented in <b>groff_out</b>(5). The intermediate
    output language is a kind of assembly language compared to the high-level
    roff language. The generated intermediate output is optimized for a special
    device, but the language is the same for every device.</p>
<p class="Pp">The roff formatter is the heart of the roff system. The
    traditional roff had two formatters, <b>nroff</b> for text devices and
    <b>troff</b> for graphical devices.</p>
<p class="Pp">Often, the name <i>troff</i> is used as a general term to refer to
    both formatters.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Devices_and_Postprocessors"><a class="permalink" href="#Devices_and_Postprocessors">Devices
  and Postprocessors</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Devices are hardware interfaces like printers, text or graphical
    terminals, etc., or software interfaces such as a conversion into a
    different text or graphical format.</p>
<p class="Pp">A roff postprocessor is a program that transforms troff output
    into a form suitable for a special device. The roff postprocessors are like
    device drivers for the output target.</p>
<p class="Pp">For each device there is a postprocessor program that fits the
    device optimally. The postprocessor parses the generated intermediate output
    and generates device-specific code that is sent directly to the device.</p>
<p class="Pp">The names of the devices and the postprocessor programs are not
    fixed because they greatly depend on the software and hardware abilities of
    the actual computer. For example, the classical devices mentioned in
    <i>[CSTR&#x00A0;#54]</i> have greatly changed since the classical times. The
    old hardware doesn't exist any longer and the old graphical conversions were
    quite imprecise when compared to their modern counterparts.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the Postscript device <i>post</i> in classical troff
    had a resolution of 720, while groff's <i>ps</i> device has 72000, a
    refinement of factor 100.</p>
<p class="Pp">Today the operating systems provide device drivers for most
    printer-like hardware, so it isn't necessary to write a special hardware
    postprocessor for each printer.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ROFF_PROGRAMMING"><a class="permalink" href="#ROFF_PROGRAMMING">ROFF
  PROGRAMMING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Documents using roff are normal text files decorated by roff
    formatting elements. The roff formatting language is quite powerful; it is
    almost a full programming language and provides elements to enlarge the
    language. With these, it became possible to develop macro packages that are
    tailored for special applications. Such macro packages are much handier than
    plain roff. So most people will choose a macro package without worrying
    about the internals of the roff language.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Macro_Packages"><a class="permalink" href="#Macro_Packages">Macro
  Packages</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Macro packages are collections of macros that are suitable to
    format a special kind of documents in a convenient way. This greatly eases
    the usage of roff. The macro definitions of a package are kept in a file
    called <i>name</i><b>.tmac</b> (classically <b>tmac.</b><i>name</i>). All
    tmac files are stored in one or more directories at standardized positions.
    Details on the naming of macro packages and their placement is found in
    <b>groff_tmac</b>(5).</p>
<p class="Pp">A macro package that is to be used in a document can be announced
    to the formatter by the command line option \)\$* see <b>troff</b>(1), or it
    can be specified within a document using the file inclusion requests of the
    roff language, see <b>groff</b>(7).</p>
<p class="Pp">Famous classical macro packages are <i>man</i> for traditional man
    pages, <i>mdoc</i> for BSD-style manual pages; the macro sets for books,
    articles, and letters are <i>me</i> (probably from the first name of its
    creator <i>Eric</i> Allman), <i>ms</i> (from <i>Manuscript Macros</i>), and
    <i>mm</i> (from <i>Memorandum Macros</i>).</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_roff_Formatting_Language"><a class="permalink" href="#The_roff_Formatting_Language">The
  roff Formatting Language</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The classical roff formatting language is documented in the
    <i>Troff User's Manual</i> <i>[CSTR&#x00A0;#54]</i>. The roff language is a
    full programming language providing requests, definition of macros, escape
    sequences, string variables, number or size registers, and flow
  controls.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Requests</i> are the predefined basic formatting commands
    similar to the commands at the shell prompt. The user can define
    request-like elements using predefined roff elements. These are then called
    <i>macros</i>. A document writer will not note any difference in usage for
    requests or macros; both are written on a line on their own starting with a
    dot.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Escape sequences</i> are roff elements starting with a
    backslash `\f[B]\*[@1]\f[]'\$* They can be inserted anywhere, also in the
    midst of text in a line. They are used to implement various features,
    including the insertion of non-ASCII characters with \)\$* font changes with
    \)\$* in-line comments with \)\$* the escaping of special control characters
    like \)\$* and many other features.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Strings</i> are variables that can store a string. A string is
    stored by the <b>.ds</b> request. The stored string can be retrieved later
    by the <b>\*</b> escape sequence.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Registers</i> store numbers and sizes. A register can be set
    with the request <b>.nr</b> and its value can be retrieved by the escape
    sequence <b>\n</b>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="FILE_NAME_EXTENSIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#FILE_NAME_EXTENSIONS">FILE
  NAME EXTENSIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Manual pages (man pages) take the section number as a file name
    extension, e.g., the filename for this document is <i>roff.7</i>, i.e., it
    is kept in section&#x00A0;7 of the man pages.</p>
<p class="Pp">The classical macro packages take the package name as an
    extension, e.g. <i>file.</i><b>me</b> for a document using the <i>me</i>
    macro package, <i>file.</i><b>mm</b> for <i>mm</i>, <i>file.</i><b>ms</b>
    for <i>ms</i>, <i>file.</i><b>pic</b> for <i>pic</i> files, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">But there is no general naming scheme for roff documents, though
    <i>file.</i><b>tr</b> for <i>troff file</i> is seen now and then. Maybe
    there should be a standardization for the filename extensions of roff
  files.</p>
<p class="Pp">File name extensions can be very handy in conjunction with the
    <b>less</b>(1) pager. It provides the possibility to feed all input into a
    command-line pipe that is specified in the shell environment variable
    <b>LESSOPEN</b>. This process is not well documented, so here an
  example:</p>

<p class="Pp">The best program for editing a roff document is Emacs (or Xemacs),
    see <b>emacs</b>(1). It provides an <i>nroff</i> mode that is suitable for
    all kinds of roff dialects. This mode can be activated by the following
    methods.</p>
<p class="Pp">When editing a file within Emacs the mode can be changed by typing
    `<i>M-x nroff-mode</i>', where <b>M-x</b> means to hold down the <b>Meta</b>
    key (or <b>Alt</b>) and hitting the <b>x&#x00A0;</b>key at the same

    <p class="Pp">\</p>
    <p class="Pp">as the first line of a file to have it started in nroff mode

      <b>.\&quot;</b> if a structuring element is needed.</dd>

  <dd>Never start a line with whitespace because this can lead to unexpected
      behavior. Indented paragraphs can be constructed in a controlled way by
      roff requests.</dd>
  <dt>\)\$*</dt>
  <dd>Start each sentence on a line of its own, for the spacing after a dot is
      handled differently depending on whether it terminates an abbreviation or
      a sentence. To distinguish both cases, do a line break after each
      sentence.</dd>

  <dd>To additionally use the auto-fill mode in Emacs, it is best to insert an
      empty roff request (a line consisting of a dot only) after each

    <pre>
This is an example for a roff document.
\)\$*
This is the next sentence in the same paragraph.
\)\$*
This is a longer sentence stretching over several
lines; abbreviations like `cf.' are easily
identified because the dot is not followed by a
line break.
\)\$*
In the output, this will still go to the same
paragraph.
