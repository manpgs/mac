<p class="Pp">This tutorial explains how to use the &quot;core&quot; Git
    commands to set up and work with a Git repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you just need to use Git as a revision control system you may
    prefer to start with &quot;A Tutorial Introduction to Git&quot;
    (<b>gittutorial</b>(7)) or <b>the Git User Manual</b>[1].</p>
<p class="Pp">However, an understanding of these low-level tools can be helpful
    if you want to understand Git&#x2019;s internals.</p>
<p class="Pp">The core Git is often called &quot;plumbing&quot;, with the
    prettier user interfaces on top of it called &quot;porcelain&quot;. You may
    not want to use the plumbing directly very often, but it can be good to know
    what the plumbing does when the porcelain isn&#x2019;t flushing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Back when this document was originally written, many porcelain
    commands were shell scripts. For simplicity, it still uses them as examples
    to illustrate how plumbing is fit together to form the porcelain commands.
    The source tree includes some of these scripts in contrib/examples/ for
    reference. Although these are not implemented as shell scripts anymore, the
    description of what the plumbing layer commands do is still valid.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CREATING_A_GIT_REPOSITORY"><a class="permalink" href="#CREATING_A_GIT_REPOSITORY">CREATING
  A GIT REPOSITORY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Creating a new Git repository couldn&#x2019;t be easier: all Git
    repositories start out empty, and the only thing you need to do is find
    yourself a subdirectory that you want to use as a working tree - either an
    empty one for a totally new project, or an existing working tree that you
    want to import into Git.</p>
<p class="Pp">For our first example, we&#x2019;re going to start a totally new
    repository from scratch, with no pre-existing files, and we&#x2019;ll call
    it <i>git-tutorial</i>. To start up, create a subdirectory for it, change
    into that subdirectory, and initialize the Git infrastructure with <i>git
    init</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ mkdir git-tutorial
$ cd git-tutorial
$ git init</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">to which Git will reply</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Initialized empty Git repository in .git/</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">which is just Git&#x2019;s way of saying that you haven&#x2019;t
    been doing anything strange, and that it will have created a local
    <b>.git</b> directory setup for your new project. You will now have a
    <b>.git</b> directory, and you can inspect that with <i>ls</i>. For your new
    empty project, it should show you three entries, among other things:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;a file called <b>HEAD</b>, that has <b>ref:
  refs/heads/master</b> in it. This is similar to a symbolic link and points at
  <b>refs/heads/master</b> relative to the <b>HEAD</b> file.
<p class="Pp">Don&#x2019;t worry about the fact that the file that the
    <b>HEAD</b> link points to doesn&#x2019;t even exist yet &#x2014; you
    haven&#x2019;t created the commit that will start your <b>HEAD</b>
    development branch yet.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;a subdirectory called <b>objects</b>, which will
  contain all the objects of your project. You should never have any real reason
  to look at the objects directly, but you might want to know that these objects
  are what contains all the real <i>data</i> in your repository.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;a subdirectory called <b>refs</b>, which contains
  references to objects.</div>
<p class="Pp">In particular, the <b>refs</b> subdirectory will contain two other
    subdirectories, named <b>heads</b> and <b>tags</b> respectively. They do
    exactly what their names imply: they contain references to any number of
    different <i>heads</i> of development (aka <i>branches</i>), and to any
    <i>tags</i> that you have created to name specific versions in your
    repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">One note: the special <b>master</b> head is the default branch,
    which is why the <b>.git/HEAD</b> file was created points to it even if it
    doesn&#x2019;t yet exist. Basically, the <b>HEAD</b> link is supposed to
    always point to the branch you are working on right now, and you always
    start out expecting to work on the <b>master</b> branch.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, this is only a convention, and you can name your branches
    anything you want, and don&#x2019;t have to ever even <i>have</i> a
    <b>master</b> branch. A number of the Git tools will assume that
    <b>.git/HEAD</b> is valid, though.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">An <i>object</i> is identified by its 160-bit SHA-1 hash, aka
    <i>object name</i>, and a reference to an object is always the 40-byte hex
    representation of that SHA-1 name. The files in the <b>refs</b> subdirectory
    are expected to contain these hex references (usually with a final <b>\n</b>
    at the end), and you should thus expect to see a number of 41-byte files
    containing these references in these <b>refs</b> subdirectories when you
    actually start populating your tree.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">An advanced user may want to take a look at
    <b>gitrepository-layout</b>(5) after finishing this tutorial.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">You have now created your first Git repository. Of course, since
    it&#x2019;s empty, that&#x2019;s not very useful, so let&#x2019;s start
    populating it with data.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="POPULATING_A_GIT_REPOSITORY"><a class="permalink" href="#POPULATING_A_GIT_REPOSITORY">POPULATING
  A GIT REPOSITORY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">We&#x2019;ll keep this simple and stupid, so we&#x2019;ll start
    off with populating a few trivial files just to get a feel for it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Start off with just creating any random files that you want to
    maintain in your Git repository. We&#x2019;ll start off with a few bad
    examples, just to get a feel for how this works:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ echo &quot;Hello World&quot; &gt;hello
$ echo &quot;Silly example&quot; &gt;example</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">you have now created two files in your working tree (aka
    <i>working directory</i>), but to actually check in your hard work, you will
    have to go through two steps:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;fill in the <i>index</i> file (aka <i>cache</i>)
  with the information about your working tree state.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;commit that index file as an object.</div>
<p class="Pp">The first step is trivial: when you want to tell Git about any
    changes to your working tree, you use the <i>git update-index</i> program.
    That program normally just takes a list of filenames you want to update, but
    to avoid trivial mistakes, it refuses to add new entries to the index (or
    remove existing ones) unless you explicitly tell it that you&#x2019;re
    adding a new entry with the <b>--add</b> flag (or removing an entry with the
    <b>--remove</b>) flag.</p>
<p class="Pp">So to populate the index with the two files you just created, you
    can do</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git update-index --add hello example</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">and you have now told Git to track those two files.</p>
<p class="Pp">In fact, as you did that, if you now look into your object
    directory, you&#x2019;ll notice that Git will have added two new objects to
    the object database. If you did exactly the steps above, you should now be
    able to do</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ ls .git/objects/??/*</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">and see two files:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>.git/objects/55/7db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238
.git/objects/f2/4c74a2e500f5ee1332c86b94199f52b1d1d962</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">which correspond with the objects with names of <b>557db...</b>
    and <b>f24c7...</b> respectively.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to, you can use <i>git cat-file</i> to look at those
    objects, but you&#x2019;ll have to use the object name, not the filename of
    the object:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git cat-file -t 557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">where the <b>-t</b> tells <i>git cat-file</i> to tell you what the
    &quot;type&quot; of the object is. Git will tell you that you have a
    &quot;blob&quot; object (i.e., just a regular file), and you can see the
    contents with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git cat-file blob 557db03</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">which will print out &quot;Hello World&quot;. The object
    <b>557db03</b> is nothing more than the contents of your file
  <b>hello</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">Don&#x2019;t confuse that object with the file <b>hello</b>
    itself. The object is literally just those specific <b>contents</b> of the
    file, and however much you later change the contents in file <b>hello</b>,
    the object we just looked at will never change. Objects are immutable.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">The second example demonstrates that you can abbreviate the object
    name to only the first several hexadecimal digits in most places.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Anyway, as we mentioned previously, you normally never actually
    take a look at the objects themselves, and typing long 40-character hex
    names is not something you&#x2019;d normally want to do. The above
    digression was just to show that <i>git update-index</i> did something
    magical, and actually saved away the contents of your files into the Git
    object database.</p>
<p class="Pp">Updating the index did something else too: it created a
    <b>.git/index</b> file. This is the index that describes your current
    working tree, and something you should be very aware of. Again, you normally
    never worry about the index file itself, but you should be aware of the fact
    that you have not actually really &quot;checked in&quot; your files into Git
    so far, you&#x2019;ve only <b>told</b> Git about them.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, since Git knows about them, you can now start using some
    of the most basic Git commands to manipulate the files or look at their
    status.</p>
<p class="Pp">In particular, let&#x2019;s not even check in the two files into
    Git yet, we&#x2019;ll start off by adding another line to <b>hello</b>
    first:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ echo &quot;It's a new day for git&quot; &gt;&gt;hello</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">and you can now, since you told Git about the previous state of
    <b>hello</b>, ask Git what has changed in the tree compared to your old
    index, using the <i>git diff-files</i> command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git diff-files</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Oops. That wasn&#x2019;t very readable. It just spit out its own
    internal version of a <i>diff</i>, but that internal version really just
    tells you that it has noticed that &quot;hello&quot; has been modified, and
    that the old object contents it had have been replaced with something
  else.</p>
<p class="Pp">To make it readable, we can tell <i>git diff-files</i> to output
    the differences as a patch, using the <b>-p</b> flag:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git diff-files -p
diff --git a/hello b/hello
index 557db03..263414f 100644
--- a/hello
+++ b/hello
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 Hello World
+It's a new day for git</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">i.e. the diff of the change we caused by adding another line to
    <b>hello</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In other words, <i>git diff-files</i> always shows us the
    difference between what is recorded in the index, and what is currently in
    the working tree. That&#x2019;s very useful.</p>
<p class="Pp">A common shorthand for <b>git diff-files -p</b> is to just write
    <b>git diff</b>, which will do the same thing.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git diff
diff --git a/hello b/hello

<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMITTING_GIT_STATE"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMITTING_GIT_STATE">COMMITTING
  GIT STATE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Now, we want to go to the next stage in Git, which is to take the
    files that Git knows about in the index, and commit them as a real tree. We
    do that in two phases: creating a <i>tree</i> object, and committing that
    <i>tree</i> object as a <i>commit</i> object together with an explanation of
    what the tree was all about, along with information of how we came to that
    state.</p>
<p class="Pp">Creating a tree object is trivial, and is done with <i>git
    write-tree</i>. There are no options or other input: <b>git write-tree</b>
    will take the current index state, and write an object that describes that
    whole index. In other words, we&#x2019;re now tying together all the
    different filenames with their contents (and their permissions), and
    we&#x2019;re creating the equivalent of a Git &quot;directory&quot;
  object:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git write-tree</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">and this will just output the name of the resulting tree, in this
    case (if you have done exactly as I&#x2019;ve described) it should be</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>8988da15d077d4829fc51d8544c097def6644dbb</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">which is another incomprehensible object name. Again, if you want
    to, you can use <b>git cat-file -t 8988d...</b> to see that this time the
    object is not a &quot;blob&quot; object, but a &quot;tree&quot; object (you
    can also use <b>git cat-file</b> to actually output the raw object contents,
    but you&#x2019;ll see mainly a binary mess, so that&#x2019;s less
    interesting).</p>
<p class="Pp">However &#x2014; normally you&#x2019;d never use <i>git
    write-tree</i> on its own, because normally you always commit a tree into a
    commit object using the <i>git commit-tree</i> command. In fact, it&#x2019;s
    easier to not actually use <i>git write-tree</i> on its own at all, but to
    just pass its result in as an argument to <i>git commit-tree</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>git commit-tree</i> normally takes several arguments &#x2014;
    it wants to know what the <i>parent</i> of a commit was, but since this is
    the first commit ever in this new repository, and it has no parents, we only
    need to pass in the object name of the tree. However, <i>git commit-tree</i>
    also wants to get a commit message on its standard input, and it will write
    out the resulting object name for the commit to its standard output.</p>
<p class="Pp">And this is where we create the <b>.git/refs/heads/master</b> file
    which is pointed at by <b>HEAD</b>. This file is supposed to contain the
    reference to the top-of-tree of the master branch, and since that&#x2019;s
    exactly what <i>git commit-tree</i> spits out, we can do this all with a
    sequence of simple shell commands:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ tree=$(git write-tree)
$ commit=$(echo 'Initial commit' | git commit-tree $tree)
$ git update-ref HEAD $commit</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">In this case this creates a totally new commit that is not related
    to anything else. Normally you do this only <b>once</b> for a project ever,
    and all later commits will be parented on top of an earlier commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">Again, normally you&#x2019;d never actually do this by hand. There
    is a helpful script called <b>git commit</b> that will do all of this for
    you. So you could have just written <b>git commit</b> instead, and it would
    have done the above magic scripting for you.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MAKING_A_CHANGE"><a class="permalink" href="#MAKING_A_CHANGE">MAKING
  A CHANGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Remember how we did the <i>git update-index</i> on file
    <b>hello</b> and then we changed <b>hello</b> afterward, and could compare
    the new state of <b>hello</b> with the state we saved in the index file?</p>
<p class="Pp">Further, remember how I said that <i>git write-tree</i> writes the
    contents of the <b>index</b> file to the tree, and thus what we just
    committed was in fact the <b>original</b> contents of the file <b>hello</b>,
    not the new ones. We did that on purpose, to show the difference between the
    index state, and the state in the working tree, and how they don&#x2019;t
    have to match, even when we commit things.</p>
<p class="Pp">As before, if we do <b>git diff-files -p</b> in our git-tutorial
    project, we&#x2019;ll still see the same difference we saw last time: the
    index file hasn&#x2019;t changed by the act of committing anything. However,
    now that we have committed something, we can also learn to use a new
    command: <i>git diff-index</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike <i>git diff-files</i>, which showed the difference between
    the index file and the working tree, <i>git diff-index</i> shows the
    differences between a committed <b>tree</b> and either the index file or the
    working tree. In other words, <i>git diff-index</i> wants a tree to be
    diffed against, and before we did the commit, we couldn&#x2019;t do that,
    because we didn&#x2019;t have anything to diff against.</p>
<p class="Pp">But now we can do</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git diff-index -p HEAD</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">(where <b>-p</b> has the same meaning as it did in <i>git
    diff-files</i>), and it will show us the same difference, but for a totally
    different reason. Now we&#x2019;re comparing the working tree not against
    the index file, but against the tree we just wrote. It just so happens that
    those two are obviously the same, so we get the same result.</p>
<p class="Pp">Again, because this is a common operation, you can also just
    shorthand it with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git diff HEAD</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">which ends up doing the above for you.</p>
<p class="Pp">In other words, <i>git diff-index</i> normally compares a tree
    against the working tree, but when given the <b>--cached</b> flag, it is
    told to instead compare against just the index cache contents, and ignore
    the current working tree state entirely. Since we just wrote the index file
    to HEAD, doing <b>git diff-index --cached -p HEAD</b> should thus return an
    empty set of differences, and that&#x2019;s exactly what it does.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp"><i>git diff-index</i> really always uses the index for its
    comparisons, and saying that it compares a tree against the working tree is
    thus not strictly accurate. In particular, the list of files to compare (the
    &quot;meta-data&quot;) <b>always</b> comes from the index file, regardless
    of whether the <b>--cached</b> flag is used or not. The <b>--cached</b> flag
    really only determines whether the file <b>contents</b> to be compared come
    from the working tree or not.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is not hard to understand, as soon as you realize that Git
    simply never knows (or cares) about files that it is not told about
    explicitly. Git will never go <b>looking</b> for files to compare, it
    expects you to tell it what the files are, and that&#x2019;s what the index
    is there for.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">However, our next step is to commit the <b>change</b> we did, and
    again, to understand what&#x2019;s going on, keep in mind the difference
    between &quot;working tree contents&quot;, &quot;index file&quot; and
    &quot;committed tree&quot;. We have changes in the working tree that we want
    to commit, and we always have to work through the index file, so the first
    thing we need to do is to update the index cache:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git update-index hello</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">(note how we didn&#x2019;t need the <b>--add</b> flag this time,
    since Git knew about the file already).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note what happens to the different <i>git diff-*</i> versions
    here. After we&#x2019;ve updated <b>hello</b> in the index, <b>git
    diff-files -p</b> now shows no differences, but <b>git diff-index -p
    HEAD</b> still <b>does</b> show that the current state is different from the
    state we committed. In fact, now <i>git diff-index</i> shows the same
    difference whether we use the <b>--cached</b> flag or not, since now the
    index is coherent with the working tree.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now, since we&#x2019;ve updated <b>hello</b> in the index, we can
    commit the new version. We could do it by writing the tree by hand again,
    and committing the tree (this time we&#x2019;d have to use the <b>-p
    HEAD</b> flag to tell commit that the HEAD was the <b>parent</b> of the new
    commit, and that this wasn&#x2019;t an initial commit any more), but
    you&#x2019;ve done that once already, so let&#x2019;s just use the helpful
    script this time:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git commit</pre>

<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">which starts an editor for you to write the commit message and
    tells you a bit about what you have done.</p>
<p class="Pp">Write whatever message you want, and all the lines that start with
    <i>#</i> will be pruned out, and the rest will be used as the commit message
    for the change. If you decide you don&#x2019;t want to commit anything after
    all at this point (you can continue to edit things and update the index),
    you can just leave an empty message. Otherwise <b>git commit</b> will commit
    the change for you.</p>
<p class="Pp">You&#x2019;ve now made your first real Git commit. And if
    you&#x2019;re interested in looking at what <b>git commit</b> really does,
    feel free to investigate: it&#x2019;s a few very simple shell scripts to
    generate the helpful (?) commit message headers, and a few one-liners that
    actually do the commit itself (<i>git commit</i>).</p>

<p class="Pp">While creating changes is useful, it&#x2019;s even more useful if
    you can tell later what changed. The most useful command for this is another
    of the <i>diff</i> family, namely <i>git diff-tree</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>git diff-tree</i> can be given two arbitrary trees, and it will
    tell you the differences between them. Perhaps even more commonly, though,
    you can give it just a single commit object, and it will figure out the
    parent of that commit itself, and show the difference directly. Thus, to get
    the same diff that we&#x2019;ve already seen several times, we can now
  do</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git diff-tree -p HEAD</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">(again, <b>-p</b> means to show the difference as a human-readable
    patch), and it will show what the last commit (in <b>HEAD</b>) actually
    changed.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">Here is an ASCII art by Jon Loeliger that illustrates how various
    <i>diff-*</i> commands compare things.</p>

<p class="Pp">More interestingly, you can also give <i>git diff-tree</i> the
    <b>--pretty</b> flag, which tells it to also show the commit message and
    author and date of the commit, and you can tell it to show a whole series of
    diffs. Alternatively, you can tell it to be &quot;silent&quot;, and not show
    the diffs at all, but just show the actual commit message.</p>
<p class="Pp">In fact, together with the <i>git rev-list</i> program (which
    generates a list of revisions), <i>git diff-tree</i> ends up being a
    veritable fount of changes. You can emulate <b>git log</b>, <b>git log
    -p</b>, etc. with a trivial script that pipes the output of <b>git
    rev-list</b> to <b>git diff-tree --stdin</b>, which was exactly how early
    versions of <b>git log</b> were implemented.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="TAGGING_A_VERSION"><a class="permalink" href="#TAGGING_A_VERSION">TAGGING
  A VERSION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In Git, there are two kinds of tags, a &quot;light&quot; one, and
    an &quot;annotated tag&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">A &quot;light&quot; tag is technically nothing more than a branch,
    except we put it in the <b>.git/refs/tags/</b> subdirectory instead of
    calling it a <b>head</b>. So the simplest form of tag involves nothing more
    than</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git tag my-first-tag</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">which just writes the current <b>HEAD</b> into the
    <b>.git/refs/tags/my-first-tag</b> file, after which point you can then use
    this symbolic name for that particular state. You can, for example, do</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git diff my-first-tag</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">to diff your current state against that tag which at this point
    will obviously be an empty diff, but if you continue to develop and commit
    stuff, you can use your tag as an &quot;anchor-point&quot; to see what has
    changed since you tagged it.</p>
<p class="Pp">An &quot;annotated tag&quot; is actually a real Git object, and
    contains not only a pointer to the state you want to tag, but also a small
    tag name and message, along with optionally a PGP signature that says that
    yes, you really did that tag. You create these annotated tags with either
    the <b>-a</b> or <b>-s</b> flag to <i>git tag</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git tag -s &lt;tagname&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">which will sign the current <b>HEAD</b> (but you can also give it
    another argument that specifies the thing to tag, e.g., you could have
    tagged the current <b>mybranch</b> point by using <b>git tag &lt;tagname&gt;
    mybranch</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">You normally only do signed tags for major releases or things like
    that, while the light-weight tags are useful for any marking you want to do
    &#x2014; any time you decide that you want to remember a certain point, just
    create a private tag for it, and you have a nice symbolic name for the state
    at that point.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="COPYING_REPOSITORIES"><a class="permalink" href="#COPYING_REPOSITORIES">COPYING
  REPOSITORIES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Git repositories are normally totally self-sufficient and
    relocatable. Unlike CVS, for example, there is no separate notion of
    &quot;repository&quot; and &quot;working tree&quot;. A Git repository
    normally <b>is</b> the working tree, with the local Git information hidden
    in the <b>.git</b> subdirectory. There is nothing else. What you see is what
    you got.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">You can tell Git to split the Git internal information from the
    directory that it tracks, but we&#x2019;ll ignore that for now: it&#x2019;s
    not how normal projects work, and it&#x2019;s really only meant for special
    uses. So the mental model of &quot;the Git information is always tied
    directly to the working tree that it describes&quot; may not be technically
    100% accurate, but it&#x2019;s a good model for all normal use.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This has two implications:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;if you grow bored with the tutorial repository
  you created (or you&#x2019;ve made a mistake and want to start all over), you
  can just do simple
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ rm -rf git-tutorial</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">and it will be gone. There&#x2019;s no external repository, and
    there&#x2019;s no history outside the project you created.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;if you want to move or duplicate a Git
  repository, you can do so. There is <i>git clone</i> command, but if all you
  want to do is just to create a copy of your repository (with all the full
  history that went along with it), you can do so with a regular <b>cp -a
  git-tutorial new-git-tutorial</b>.
<p class="Pp">Note that when you&#x2019;ve moved or copied a Git repository,
    your Git index file (which caches various information, notably some of the
    &quot;stat&quot; information for the files involved) will likely need to be
    refreshed. So after you do a <b>cp -a</b> to create a new copy,
    you&#x2019;ll want to do</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git update-index --refresh</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">in the new repository to make sure that the index file is up to
    date.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that the second point is true even across machines. You can
    duplicate a remote Git repository with <b>any</b> regular copy mechanism, be
    it <i>scp</i>, <i>rsync</i> or <i>wget</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When copying a remote repository, you&#x2019;ll want to at a
    minimum update the index cache when you do this, and especially with other
    peoples' repositories you often want to make sure that the index cache is in
    some known state (you don&#x2019;t know <b>what</b> they&#x2019;ve done and
    not yet checked in), so usually you&#x2019;ll precede the <i>git
    update-index</i> with a</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git read-tree --reset HEAD
$ git update-index --refresh</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">which will force a total index re-build from the tree pointed to
    by <b>HEAD</b>. It resets the index contents to <b>HEAD</b>, and then the
    <i>git update-index</i> makes sure to match up all index entries with the
    checked-out files. If the original repository had uncommitted changes in its
    working tree, <b>git update-index --refresh</b> notices them and tells you
    they need to be updated.</p>
<p class="Pp">The above can also be written as simply</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git reset</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">and in fact a lot of the common Git command combinations can be
    scripted with the <b>git xyz</b> interfaces. You can learn things by just
    looking at what the various git scripts do. For example, <b>git reset</b>
    used to be the above two lines implemented in <i>git reset</i>, but some
    things like <i>git status</i> and <i>git commit</i> are slightly more
    complex scripts around the basic Git commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many (most?) public remote repositories will not contain any of
    the checked out files or even an index file, and will <b>only</b> contain
    the actual core Git files. Such a repository usually doesn&#x2019;t even
    have the <b>.git</b> subdirectory, but has all the Git files directly in the
    repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">To create your own local live copy of such a &quot;raw&quot; Git
    repository, you&#x2019;d first create your own subdirectory for the project,
    and then copy the raw repository contents into the <b>.git</b> directory.
    For example, to create your own copy of the Git repository, you&#x2019;d do
    the following</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ mkdir my-git
$ cd my-git
$ rsync -rL rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/ .git</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">followed by</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git read-tree HEAD</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">to populate the index. However, now you have populated the index,
    and you have all the Git internal files, but you will notice that you
    don&#x2019;t actually have any of the working tree files to work on. To get
    those, you&#x2019;d check them out with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git checkout-index -u -a</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">where the <b>-u</b> flag means that you want the checkout to keep
    the index up to date (so that you don&#x2019;t have to refresh it
    afterward), and the <b>-a</b> flag means &quot;check out all files&quot; (if
    you have a stale copy or an older version of a checked out tree you may also
    need to add the <b>-f</b> flag first, to tell <i>git checkout-index</i> to
    <b>force</b> overwriting of any old files).</p>
<p class="Pp">Again, this can all be simplified with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/ my-git
$ cd my-git
$ git checkout</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">which will end up doing all of the above for you.</p>
<p class="Pp">You have now successfully copied somebody else&#x2019;s (mine)
    remote repository, and checked it out.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CREATING_A_NEW_BRANCH"><a class="permalink" href="#CREATING_A_NEW_BRANCH">CREATING
  A NEW BRANCH</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Branches in Git are really nothing more than pointers into the Git
    object database from within the <b>.git/refs/</b> subdirectory, and as we
    already discussed, the <b>HEAD</b> branch is nothing but a symlink to one of
    these object pointers.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can at any time create a new branch by just picking an
    arbitrary point in the project history, and just writing the SHA-1 name of
    that object into a file under <b>.git/refs/heads/</b>. You can use any
    filename you want (and indeed, subdirectories), but the convention is that
    the &quot;normal&quot; branch is called <b>master</b>. That&#x2019;s just a
    convention, though, and nothing enforces it.</p>
<p class="Pp">To show that as an example, let&#x2019;s go back to the
    git-tutorial repository we used earlier, and create a branch in it. You do
    that by simply just saying that you want to check out a new branch:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git switch -c mybranch</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">will create a new branch based at the current <b>HEAD</b>
    position, and switch to it.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">If you make the decision to start your new branch at some other
    point in the history than the current <b>HEAD</b>, you can do so by just
    telling <i>git switch</i> what the base of the checkout would be. In other
    words, if you have an earlier tag or branch, you&#x2019;d just do</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git switch -c mybranch earlier-commit</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">and it would create the new branch <b>mybranch</b> at the earlier
    commit, and check out the state at that time.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">You can always just jump back to your original <b>master</b>
    branch by doing</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git switch master</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">(or any other branch-name, for that matter) and if you forget
    which branch you happen to be on, a simple</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ cat .git/HEAD</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">will tell you where it&#x2019;s pointing. To get the list of
    branches you have, you can say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git branch</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">which used to be nothing more than a simple script around <b>ls
    .git/refs/heads</b>. There will be an asterisk in front of the branch you
    are currently on.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes you may wish to create a new branch <i>without</i>
    actually checking it out and switching to it. If so, just use the
  command</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git branch &lt;branchname&gt; [startingpoint]</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">which will simply <i>create</i> the branch, but will not do
    anything further. You can then later &#x2014; once you decide that you want
    to actually develop on that branch &#x2014; switch to that branch with a
    regular <i>git switch</i> with the branchname as the argument.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MERGING_TWO_BRANCHES"><a class="permalink" href="#MERGING_TWO_BRANCHES">MERGING
  TWO BRANCHES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">One of the ideas of having a branch is that you do some (possibly
    experimental) work in it, and eventually merge it back to the main branch.
    So assuming you created the above <b>mybranch</b> that started out being the
    same as the original <b>master</b> branch, let&#x2019;s make sure
    we&#x2019;re in that branch, and do some work there.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git switch mybranch
$ echo &quot;Work, work, work&quot; &gt;&gt;hello
$ git commit -m &quot;Some work.&quot; -i hello</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Here, we just added another line to <b>hello</b>, and we used a
    shorthand for doing both <b>git update-index hello</b> and <b>git commit</b>
    by just giving the filename directly to <b>git commit</b>, with an <b>-i</b>
    flag (it tells Git to <i>include</i> that file in addition to what you have
    done to the index file so far when making the commit). The <b>-m</b> flag is
    to give the commit log message from the command line.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now, to make it a bit more interesting, let&#x2019;s assume that
    somebody else does some work in the original branch, and simulate that by
    going back to the master branch, and editing the same file differently
    there:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git switch master</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Here, take a moment to look at the contents of <b>hello</b>, and
    notice how they don&#x2019;t contain the work we just did in <b>mybranch</b>
    &#x2014; because that work hasn&#x2019;t happened in the <b>master</b>
    branch at all. Then do</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ echo &quot;Play, play, play&quot; &gt;&gt;hello
$ echo &quot;Lots of fun&quot; &gt;&gt;example
$ git commit -m &quot;Some fun.&quot; -i hello example</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">since the master branch is obviously in a much better mood.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now, you&#x2019;ve got two branches, and you decide that you want
    to merge the work done. Before we do that, let&#x2019;s introduce a cool
    graphical tool that helps you view what&#x2019;s going on:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ gitk --all</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">will show you graphically both of your branches (that&#x2019;s
    what the <b>--all</b> means: normally it will just show you your current
    <b>HEAD</b>) and their histories. You can also see exactly how they came to
    be from a common source.</p>
<p class="Pp">Anyway, let&#x2019;s exit <i>gitk</i> (<b>^Q</b> or the File
    menu), and decide that we want to merge the work we did on the
    <b>mybranch</b> branch into the <b>master</b> branch (which is currently our
    <b>HEAD</b> too). To do that, there&#x2019;s a nice script called <i>git
    merge</i>, which wants to know which branches you want to resolve and what
    the merge is all about:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git merge -m &quot;Merge work in mybranch&quot; mybranch</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">where the first argument is going to be used as the commit message
    if the merge can be resolved automatically.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now, in this case we&#x2019;ve intentionally created a situation
    where the merge will need to be fixed up by hand, though, so Git will do as
    much of it as it can automatically (which in this case is just merge the
    <b>example</b> file, which had no differences in the <b>mybranch</b>
    branch), and say:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        Auto-merging hello
        CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello
        Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">It tells you that it did an &quot;Automatic merge&quot;, which
    failed due to conflicts in <b>hello</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Not to worry. It left the (trivial) conflict in <b>hello</b> in
    the same form you should already be well used to if you&#x2019;ve ever used
    CVS, so let&#x2019;s just open <b>hello</b> in our editor (whatever that may
    be), and fix it up somehow. I&#x2019;d suggest just making it so that
    <b>hello</b> contains all four lines:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Hello World
It's a new day for git
Play, play, play
Work, work, work</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">and once you&#x2019;re happy with your manual merge, just do a</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git commit -i hello</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">which will very loudly warn you that you&#x2019;re now committing
    a merge (which is correct, so never mind), and you can write a small merge
    message about your adventures in <i>git merge</i>-land.</p>
<p class="Pp">After you&#x2019;re done, start up <b>gitk --all</b> to see
    graphically what the history looks like. Notice that <b>mybranch</b> still
    exists, and you can switch to it, and continue to work with it if you want
    to. The <b>mybranch</b> branch will not contain the merge, but next time you
    merge it from the <b>master</b> branch, Git will know how you merged it, so
    you&#x2019;ll not have to do <i>that</i> merge again.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another useful tool, especially if you do not always work in
    X-Window environment, is <b>git show-branch</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git show-branch --topo-order --more=1 master mybranch
* [master] Merge work in mybranch
 ! [mybranch] Some work.
--
-  [master] Merge work in mybranch
*+ [mybranch] Some work.
*  [master^] Some fun.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The first two lines indicate that it is showing the two branches
    with the titles of their top-of-the-tree commits, you are currently on
    <b>master</b> branch (notice the asterisk <b>*</b> character), and the first
    column for the later output lines is used to show commits contained in the
    <b>master</b> branch, and the second column for the <b>mybranch</b> branch.
    Three commits are shown along with their titles. All of them have non blank
    characters in the first column (<b>*</b> shows an ordinary commit on the
    current branch, <b>-</b> is a merge commit), which means they are now part
    of the <b>master</b> branch. Only the &quot;Some work&quot; commit has the
    plus <b>+</b> character in the second column, because <b>mybranch</b> has
    not been merged to incorporate these commits from the master branch. The
    string inside brackets before the commit log message is a short name you can
    use to name the commit. In the above example, <i>master</i> and
    <i>mybranch</i> are branch heads. <i>master^</i> is the first parent of
    <i>master</i> branch head. Please see <b>gitrevisions</b>(7) if you want to
    see more complex cases.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">Without the <i>--more=1</i> option, <i>git show-branch</i> would
    not output the <i>[master^]</i> commit, as <i>[mybranch]</i> commit is a

<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">If there were more commits on the <i>master</i> branch after the

<p class="Pp">Now, let&#x2019;s pretend you are the one who did all the work in

  EXTERNAL WORK</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">It&#x2019;s usually much more common that you merge with somebody
    else than merging with your own branches, so it&#x2019;s worth pointing out
    that Git makes that very easy too, and in fact, it&#x2019;s not that
    different from doing a <i>git merge</i>. In fact, a remote merge ends up
    being nothing more than &quot;fetch the work from a remote repository into a
    temporary tag&quot; followed by a <i>git merge</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Fetching from a remote repository is done by, unsurprisingly,
    <i>git fetch</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git fetch &lt;remote-repository&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">One of the following transports can be used to name the repository
    to download from:</p>
<p class="Pp">SSH</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>remote.machine:/path/to/repo.git/</b> or
<p class="Pp"><b>ssh://remote.machine/path/to/repo.git/</b></p>
<p class="Pp">This transport can be used for both uploading and downloading, and
    requires you to have a log-in privilege over <b>ssh</b> to the remote
    machine. It finds out the set of objects the other side lacks by exchanging
    the head commits both ends have and transfers (close to) minimum set of
    objects. It is by far the most efficient way to exchange Git objects between
    repositories.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Local directory</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>/path/to/repo.git/</b>
<p class="Pp">This transport is the same as SSH transport but uses <i>sh</i> to
    run both ends on the local machine instead of running other end on the
    remote machine via <i>ssh</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Git Native</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>git://remote.machine/path/to/repo.git/</b>
<p class="Pp">This transport was designed for anonymous downloading. Like SSH
    transport, it finds out the set of objects the downstream side lacks and
    transfers (close to) minimum set of objects.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">HTTP(S)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>http://remote.machine/path/to/repo.git/</b>
<p class="Pp">Downloader from http and https URL first obtains the topmost
    commit object name from the remote site by looking at the specified refname
    under <b>repo.git/refs/</b> directory, and then tries to obtain the commit
    object by downloading from <b>repo.git/objects/xx/xxx...</b> using the
    object name of that commit object. Then it reads the commit object to find
    out its parent commits and the associate tree object; it repeats this
    process until it gets all the necessary objects. Because of this behavior,
    they are sometimes also called <i>commit walkers</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>commit walkers</i> are sometimes also called <i>dumb
    transports</i>, because they do not require any Git aware smart server like
    Git Native transport does. Any stock HTTP server that does not even support
    directory index would suffice. But you must prepare your repository with
    <i>git update-server-info</i> to help dumb transport downloaders.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Once you fetch from the remote repository, you <b>merge</b> that
    with your current branch.</p>
<p class="Pp">However &#x2014; it&#x2019;s such a common thing to <b>fetch</b>
    and then immediately <b>merge</b>, that it&#x2019;s called <b>git pull</b>,
    and you can simply do</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git pull &lt;remote-repository&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">and optionally give a branch-name for the remote end as a second
    argument.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">You could do without using any branches at all, by keeping as many
    local repositories as you would like to have branches, and merging between
    them with <i>git pull</i>, just like you merge between branches. The
    advantage of this approach is that it lets you keep a set of files for each
    <b>branch</b> checked out and you may find it easier to switch back and
    forth if you juggle multiple lines of development simultaneously. Of course,
    you will pay the price of more disk usage to hold multiple working trees,
    but disk space is cheap these days.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">It is likely that you will be pulling from the same remote
    repository from time to time. As a short hand, you can store the remote
    repository URL in the local repository&#x2019;s config file like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git config remote.linus.url http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">and use the &quot;linus&quot; keyword with <i>git pull</i> instead
    of the full URL.</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.<b>git pull linus</b></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.<b>git pull linus tag v0.99.1</b></div>
<p class="Pp">the above are equivalent to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.<b>git pull http://www.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git/
  HEAD</b></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="HOW_DOES_THE_MERGE_WORK?"><a class="permalink" href="#HOW_DOES_THE_MERGE_WORK?">HOW
  DOES THE MERGE WORK?</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">We said this tutorial shows what plumbing does to help you cope
    with the porcelain that isn&#x2019;t flushing, but we so far did not talk
    about how the merge really works. If you are following this tutorial the
    first time, I&#x2019;d suggest to skip to &quot;Publishing your work&quot;
    section and come back here later.</p>
<p class="Pp">OK, still with me? To give us an example to look at, let&#x2019;s
    go back to the earlier repository with &quot;hello&quot; and
    &quot;example&quot; file, and bring ourselves back to the pre-merge
  state:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git show-branch --more=2 master mybranch
! [master] Merge work in mybranch
 * [mybranch] Merge work in mybranch
--
-- [master] Merge work in mybranch
+* [master^2] Some work.
+* [master^] Some fun.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Remember, before running <i>git merge</i>, our <b>master</b> head
    was at &quot;Some fun.&quot; commit, while our <b>mybranch</b> head was at
    &quot;Some work.&quot; commit.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git switch -C mybranch master^2
$ git switch master
$ git reset --hard master^</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">After rewinding, the commit structure should look like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git show-branch
* [master] Some fun.
 ! [mybranch] Some work.
--
*  [master] Some fun.
 + [mybranch] Some work.
*+ [master^] Initial commit</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Now we are ready to experiment with the merge by hand.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git merge</b> command, when merging two branches, uses 3-way
    merge algorithm. First, it finds the common ancestor between them. The
    command it uses is <i>git merge-base</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ mb=$(git merge-base HEAD mybranch)</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The command writes the commit object name of the common ancestor
    to the standard output, so we captured its output to a variable, because we
    will be using it in the next step. By the way, the common ancestor commit is
    the &quot;Initial commit&quot; commit in this case. You can tell it by:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git name-rev --name-only --tags $mb
my-first-tag</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">After finding out a common ancestor commit, the second step is
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git read-tree -m -u $mb HEAD mybranch</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This is the same <i>git read-tree</i> command we have already
    seen, but it takes three trees, unlike previous examples. This reads the
    contents of each tree into different <i>stage</i> in the index file (the
    first tree goes to stage 1, the second to stage 2, etc.). After reading
    three trees into three stages, the paths that are the same in all three
    stages are <i>collapsed</i> into stage 0. Also paths that are the same in
    two of three stages are collapsed into stage 0, taking the SHA-1 from either
    stage 2 or stage 3, whichever is different from stage 1 (i.e. only one side
    changed from the common ancestor).</p>
<p class="Pp">After <i>collapsing</i> operation, paths that are different in
    three trees are left in non-zero stages. At this point, you can inspect the
    index file with this command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git ls-files --stage
100644 7f8b141b65fdcee47321e399a2598a235a032422 0       example
100644 557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238 1       hello
100644 ba42a2a96e3027f3333e13ede4ccf4498c3ae942 2       hello
100644 cc44c73eb783565da5831b4d820c962954019b69 3       hello</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">In our example of only two files, we did not have unchanged files
    so only <i>example</i> resulted in collapsing. But in real-life large
    projects, when only a small number of files change in one commit, this
    <i>collapsing</i> tends to trivially merge most of the paths fairly quickly,
    leaving only a handful of real changes in non-zero stages.</p>
<p class="Pp">To look at only non-zero stages, use <b>--unmerged</b> flag:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git ls-files --unmerged
100644 557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238 1       hello
100644 ba42a2a96e3027f3333e13ede4ccf4498c3ae942 2       hello
100644 cc44c73eb783565da5831b4d820c962954019b69 3       hello</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The next step of merging is to merge these three versions of the
    file, using 3-way merge. This is done by giving <i>git merge-one-file</i>
    command as one of the arguments to <i>git merge-index</i> command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git merge-index git-merge-one-file hello
Auto-merging hello
ERROR: Merge conflict in hello
fatal: merge program failed</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"><i>git merge-one-file</i> script is called with parameters to
    describe those three versions, and is responsible to leave the merge results
    in the working tree. It is a fairly straightforward shell script, and
    eventually calls <i>merge</i> program from RCS suite to perform a file-level
    3-way merge. In this case, <i>merge</i> detects conflicts, and the merge
    result with conflict marks is left in the working tree.. This can be seen if
    you run <b>ls-files --stage</b> again at this point:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git ls-files --stage
100644 7f8b141b65fdcee47321e399a2598a235a032422 0       example
100644 557db03de997c86a4a028e1ebd3a1ceb225be238 1       hello
100644 ba42a2a96e3027f3333e13ede4ccf4498c3ae942 2       hello
100644 cc44c73eb783565da5831b4d820c962954019b69 3       hello</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This is the state of the index file and the working file after
    <i>git merge</i> returns control back to you, leaving the conflicting merge
    for you to resolve. Notice that the path <b>hello</b> is still unmerged, and
    what you see with <i>git diff</i> at this point is differences since stage 2
    (i.e. your version).</p>

  YOUR WORK</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">So, we can use somebody else&#x2019;s work from a remote
    repository, but how can <b>you</b> prepare a repository to let other people
    pull from it?</p>
<p class="Pp">You do your real work in your working tree that has your primary
    repository hanging under it as its <b>.git</b> subdirectory. You
    <b>could</b> make that repository accessible remotely and ask people to pull
    from it, but in practice that is not the way things are usually done. A
    recommended way is to have a public repository, make it reachable by other
    people, and when the changes you made in your primary working tree are in
    good shape, update the public repository from it. This is often called
    <i>pushing</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">This public repository could further be mirrored, and that is how
    Git repositories at <b>kernel.org</b> are managed.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Publishing the changes from your local (private) repository to
    your remote (public) repository requires a write privilege on the remote
    machine. You need to have an SSH account there to run a single command,
    <i>git-receive-pack</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, you need to create an empty repository on the remote
    machine that will house your public repository. This empty repository will
    be populated and be kept up to date by pushing into it later. Obviously,
    this repository creation needs to be done only once.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp"><i>git push</i> uses a pair of commands, <i>git send-pack</i> on
    your local machine, and <i>git-receive-pack</i> on the remote machine. The
    communication between the two over the network internally uses an SSH
    connection.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Your private repository&#x2019;s Git directory is usually
    <b>.git</b>, but your public repository is often named after the project
    name, i.e. <b>&lt;project&gt;.git</b>. Let&#x2019;s create such a public
    repository for project <b>my-git</b>. After logging into the remote machine,
    create an empty directory:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ mkdir my-git.git</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Then, make that directory into a Git repository by running <i>git
    init</i>, but this time, since its name is not the usual <b>.git</b>, we do
    things slightly differently:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ GIT_DIR=my-git.git git init</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Make sure this directory is available for others you want your
    changes to be pulled via the transport of your choice. Also you need to make
    sure that you have the <i>git-receive-pack</i> program on the
  <b>$PATH</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">Many installations of sshd do not invoke your shell as the login
    shell when you directly run programs; what this means is that if your login
    shell is <i>bash</i>, only <b>.bashrc</b> is read and not
    <b>.bash_profile</b>. As a workaround, make sure <b>.bashrc</b> sets up
    <b>$PATH</b> so that you can run <i>git-receive-pack</i> program.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">If you plan to publish this repository to be accessed over http,
    you should do <b>mv my-git.git/hooks/post-update.sample
    my-git.git/hooks/post-update</b> at this point. This makes sure that every
    time you push into this repository, <b>git update-server-info</b> is
  run.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Your &quot;public repository&quot; is now ready to accept your
    changes. Come back to the machine you have your private repository. From
    there, run this command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git push &lt;public-host&gt;:/path/to/my-git.git master</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This synchronizes your public repository to match the named branch
    head (i.e. <b>master</b> in this case) and objects reachable from them in
    your current repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a real example, this is how I update my public Git repository.
    Kernel.org mirror network takes care of the propagation to other publicly
    visible machines:</p>

  YOUR REPOSITORY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Earlier, we saw that one file under <b>.git/objects/??/</b>
    directory is stored for each Git object you create. This representation is
    efficient to create atomically and safely, but not so convenient to
    transport over the network. Since Git objects are immutable once they are
    created, there is a way to optimize the storage by &quot;packing them
    together&quot;. The command</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git repack</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">will do it for you. If you followed the tutorial examples, you
    would have accumulated about 17 objects in <b>.git/objects/??/</b>
    directories by now. <i>git repack</i> tells you how many objects it packed,
    and stores the packed file in the <b>.git/objects/pack</b> directory.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">You will see two files, <b>pack-*.pack</b> and <b>pack-*.idx</b>,
    in <b>.git/objects/pack</b> directory. They are closely related to each
    other, and if you ever copy them by hand to a different repository for
    whatever reason, you should make sure you copy them together. The former
    holds all the data from the objects in the pack, and the latter holds the
    index for random access.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If you are paranoid, running <i>git verify-pack</i> command would
    detect if you have a corrupt pack, but do not worry too much. Our programs
    are always perfect ;-).</p>
<p class="Pp">Once you have packed objects, you do not need to leave the
    unpacked objects that are contained in the pack file anymore.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git prune-packed</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">would remove them for you.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can try running <b>find .git/objects -type f</b> before and
    after you run <b>git prune-packed</b> if you are curious. Also <b>git
    count-objects</b> would tell you how many unpacked objects are in your
    repository and how much space they are consuming.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp"><b>git pull</b> is slightly cumbersome for HTTP transport, as a
    packed repository may contain relatively few objects in a relatively large
    pack. If you expect many HTTP pulls from your public repository you might
    want to repack &amp; prune often, or never.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If you run <b>git repack</b> again at this point, it will say
    &quot;Nothing new to pack.&quot;. Once you continue your development and
    accumulate the changes, running <b>git repack</b> again will create a new
    pack, that contains objects created since you packed your repository the
    last time. We recommend that you pack your project soon after the initial
    import (unless you are starting your project from scratch), and then run
    <b>git repack</b> every once in a while, depending on how active your
    project is.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a repository is synchronized via <b>git push</b> and <b>git
    pull</b> objects packed in the source repository are usually stored unpacked
    in the destination. While this allows you to use different packing
    strategies on both ends, it also means you may need to repack both
    repositories every once in a while.</p>

<p class="Pp">Although Git is a truly distributed system, it is often convenient
    to organize your project with an informal hierarchy of developers. Linux
    kernel development is run this way. There is a nice illustration (page 17,
    &quot;Merges to Mainline&quot;) in <b>Randy Dunlap&#x2019;s
    presentation</b>[2].</p>
<p class="Pp">It should be stressed that this hierarchy is purely
    <b>informal</b>. There is nothing fundamental in Git that enforces the
    &quot;chain of patch flow&quot; this hierarchy implies. You do not have to
    pull from only one remote repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">A recommended workflow for a &quot;project lead&quot; goes like
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.Prepare your primary repository on your local machine.
  Your work is done there.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Prepare a public repository accessible to others.
<p class="Pp">If other people are pulling from your repository over dumb
    transport protocols (HTTP), you need to keep this repository <i>dumb
    transport friendly</i>. After <b>git init</b>,

  YOUR WORK TOGETHER</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">It is likely that you will be working on more than one thing at a
    time. It is easy to manage those more-or-less independent tasks using
    branches with Git.</p>
<p class="Pp">We have already seen how branches work previously, with &quot;fun
    and work&quot; example using two branches. The idea is the same if there are
    more than two branches. Let&#x2019;s say you started out from
    &quot;master&quot; head, and have some new code in the &quot;master&quot;
    branch, and two independent fixes in the &quot;commit-fix&quot; and
    &quot;diff-fix&quot; branches:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git show-branch
! [commit-fix] Fix commit message normalization.
 ! [diff-fix] Fix rename detection.
  * [master] Release candidate #1
---
 +  [diff-fix] Fix rename detection.
 +  [diff-fix~1] Better common substring algorithm.
+   [commit-fix] Fix commit message normalization.
  * [master] Release candidate #1
++* [diff-fix~2] Pretty-print messages.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Both fixes are tested well, and at this point, you want to merge
    in both of them. You could merge in <i>diff-fix</i> first and then
    <i>commit-fix</i> next, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git merge -m &quot;Merge fix in diff-fix&quot; diff-fix
$ git merge -m &quot;Merge fix in commit-fix&quot; commit-fix</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Which would result in:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git show-branch
! [commit-fix] Fix commit message normalization.
 ! [diff-fix] Fix rename detection.
  * [master] Merge fix in commit-fix
---
  - [master] Merge fix in commit-fix
+ * [commit-fix] Fix commit message normalization.
  - [master~1] Merge fix in diff-fix
 +* [diff-fix] Fix rename detection.
 +* [diff-fix~1] Better common substring algorithm.
  * [master~2] Release candidate #1
++* [master~3] Pretty-print messages.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">However, there is no particular reason to merge in one branch
    first and the other next, when what you have are a set of truly independent
    changes (if the order mattered, then they are not independent by
    definition). You could instead merge those two branches into the current
    branch at once. First let&#x2019;s undo what we just did and start over. We
    would want to get the master branch before these two merges by resetting it
    to <i>master~2</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git reset --hard master~2</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">You can make sure <b>git show-branch</b> matches the state before
    those two <i>git merge</i> you just did. Then, instead of running two <i>git
    merge</i> commands in a row, you would merge these two branch heads (this is
    known as <i>making an Octopus</i>):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git merge commit-fix diff-fix
$ git show-branch
! [commit-fix] Fix commit message normalization.
 ! [diff-fix] Fix rename detection.
  * [master] Octopus merge of branches 'diff-fix' and 'commit-fix'
---
  - [master] Octopus merge of branches 'diff-fix' and 'commit-fix'
+ * [commit-fix] Fix commit message normalization.
 +* [diff-fix] Fix rename detection.
 +* [diff-fix~1] Better common substring algorithm.
  * [master~1] Release candidate #1
++* [master~2] Pretty-print messages.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Note that you should not do Octopus just because you can. An
    octopus is a valid thing to do and often makes it easier to view the commit
    history if you are merging more than two independent changes at the same
    time. However, if you have merge conflicts with any of the branches you are
    merging in and need to hand resolve, that is an indication that the
    development happened in those branches were not independent after all, and
    you should merge two at a time, documenting how you resolved the conflicts,
    and the reason why you preferred changes made in one side over the other.
    Otherwise it would make the project history harder to follow, not
  easier.</p>
