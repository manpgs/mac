<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Mail addresses are based on the Internet protocol listed at the
    end of this manual page. These addresses are in the general format</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">user@domain</code></div>
<p class="Pp">where a domain is a hierarchical dot separated list of subdomains.
    For example, a valid address is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">eric@CS.Berkeley.EDU</code></div>
<p class="Pp">Unlike some other forms of addressing, domains do not imply any
    routing. Thus, although this address is specified as an Internet address, it
    might travel by an alternate route if that were more convenient or
    efficient. For example, at Berkeley, the associated message would probably
    go directly to CS over the Ethernet rather than going via the Berkeley
    Internet gateway.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Abbreviation."><a class="permalink" href="#Abbreviation.">Abbreviation.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Under certain circumstances it may not be necessary to type the
    entire domain name. In general, anything following the first dot may be
    omitted if it is the same as the domain from which you are sending the
    message. For example, a user on ``calder.berkeley.edu'' could send to
    ``eric@CS'' without adding the ``berkeley.edu'' since it is the same on both
    sending and receiving hosts.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Compatibility."><a class="permalink" href="#Compatibility.">Compatibility.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Certain old address formats are converted to the new format to
    provide compatibility with the previous mail system. In particular,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">user@host</code></div>
<p class="Pp">and</p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">user@host.domain</code></div>

<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">host.domain!user</code></div>

<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">host!user</code></div>
<p class="Pp">is converted to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">user@host.UUCP</code></div>
<p class="Pp">This is normally converted back to the ``host!user'' form before
    being sent on for compatibility with older UUCP hosts.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Case_Distinctions."><a class="permalink" href="#Case_Distinctions.">Case
  Distinctions.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Domain names (i.e., anything after the ``@'' sign) may be given in
    any mixture of upper and lower case with the exception of UUCP hostnames.
    Most hosts accept any combination of case in user names, with the notable
    exception of MULTICS sites.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Route-addrs."><a class="permalink" href="#Route-addrs.">Route-addrs.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Under some circumstances it may be necessary to route a message
    through several hosts to get it to the final destination. Normally this
    routing is done automatically, but sometimes it is desirable to route the
    message manually. Addresses which show these relays are termed
    ``route-addrs.'' These use the syntax:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd
  Bd-indent"><code class="Li">&lt;@hosta,@hostb:user@hostc&gt;</code></div>
<p class="Pp">This specifies that the message should be sent to hosta, from
    there to hostb, and finally to hostc. This path is forced even if there is a
    more efficient path to hostc.</p>
<p class="Pp">Route-addrs occur frequently on return addresses, since these are
    generally augmented by the software at each host. It is generally possible
    to ignore all but the ``user@hostc'' part of the address to determine the
    actual sender.</p>
<p class="Pp">[Note: the route-addr syntax is officially deprecated in RFC 1123
    and should not be used.]</p>
<p class="Pp">Many sites also support the ``percent hack'' for simplistic
    routing:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">user%hostc%hostb@hosta</code></div>
<p class="Pp">is routed as indicated in the previous example.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Postmaster."><a class="permalink" href="#Postmaster.">Postmaster.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Every site is required to have a user or user alias designated
    ``postmaster'' to which problems with the mail system may be addressed.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Other_Networks."><a class="permalink" href="#Other_Networks.">Other
  Networks.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Some other networks can be reached by giving the name of the
    network as the last component of the domain.
    <a class="permalink" href="#This"><i class="Em" id="This">This is not a
    standard feature</i></a> and may not be supported at all sites. For example,
    messages to CSNET or BITNET sites can often be sent to ``user@host.CSNET''
    or ``user@host.BITNET'' respectively.</p>

<p class="Pp">The RFC822 group syntax (``group:user1,user2,user3;'') is not

    with old berknet-style addresses.</p>
<p class="Pp">Route-Address syntax is grotty.</p>
