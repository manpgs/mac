<p class="Pp">For a live capture or ``savefile'', libpcap supplies, as the
    return value of the <b>pcap_datalink</b>(3PCAP) routine, a value that
    indicates the type of link-layer header at the beginning of the packets it
    provides. This is not necessarily the type of link-layer header that the
    packets being captured have on the network from which they're being
    captured; for example, packets from an IEEE 802.11 network might be provided
    by libpcap with Ethernet headers that the network adapter or the network
    adapter driver generates from the 802.11 headers. The names for those values
    begin with <b>DLT_</b>, so they are sometimes called &quot;DLT_
    values&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The values stored in the link-layer header type field in the
    savefile header are, in most but not all cases, the same as the values
    returned by <b>pcap_datalink</b>(). The names for those values begin with
    <b>LINKTYPE_</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The link-layer header types supported by libpcap are described at
    https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html .</p>
