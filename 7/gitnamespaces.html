<p class="Pp">Git supports dividing the refs of a single repository into
    multiple namespaces, each of which has its own branches, tags, and HEAD. Git
    can expose each namespace as an independent repository to pull from and push
    to, while sharing the object store, and exposing all the refs to operations
    such as <b>git-gc</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">Storing multiple repositories as namespaces of a single repository
    avoids storing duplicate copies of the same objects, such as when storing
    multiple branches of the same source. The alternates mechanism provides
    similar support for avoiding duplicates, but alternates do not prevent
    duplication between new objects added to the repositories without ongoing
    maintenance, while namespaces do.</p>
<p class="Pp">To specify a namespace, set the <b>GIT_NAMESPACE</b> environment
    variable to the namespace. For each ref namespace, Git stores the
    corresponding refs in a directory under <b>refs/namespaces/</b>. For
    example, <b>GIT_NAMESPACE=foo</b> will store refs under
    <b>refs/namespaces/foo/</b>. You can also specify namespaces via the
    <b>--namespace</b> option to <b>git</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that namespaces which include a <b>/</b> will expand to a
    hierarchy of namespaces; for example, <b>GIT_NAMESPACE=foo/bar</b> will
    store refs under <b>refs/namespaces/foo/refs/namespaces/bar/</b>. This makes
    paths in <b>GIT_NAMESPACE</b> behave hierarchically, so that cloning with
    <b>GIT_NAMESPACE=foo/bar</b> produces the same result as cloning with
    <b>GIT_NAMESPACE=foo</b> and cloning from that repo with
    <b>GIT_NAMESPACE=bar</b>. It also avoids ambiguity with strange namespace
    paths such as <b>foo/refs/heads/</b>, which could otherwise generate
    directory/file conflicts within the <b>refs</b> directory.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git-upload-pack</b>(1) and <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) rewrite
    the names of refs as specified by <b>GIT_NAMESPACE</b>. git-upload-pack and
    git-receive-pack will ignore all references outside the specified
  namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">The smart HTTP server, <b>git-http-backend</b>(1), will pass
    GIT_NAMESPACE through to the backend programs; see
    <b>git-http-backend</b>(1) for sample configuration to expose repository
    namespaces as repositories.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a simple local test, you can use <b>git-remote-ext</b>(1):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>git clone ext::'git --namespace=foo %s /tmp/prefixed.git'</pre>

<p class="Pp">The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side
    from stealing data from the other repository that was not intended to be
    shared. If you have private data that you need to protect from a malicious
    peer, your best option is to store it in another repository. This applies to
    both clients and servers. In particular, namespaces on a server are not
    effective for read access control; you should only grant read access to a
    namespace to clients that you would trust with read access to the entire
    repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">The known attack vectors are as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.The victim sends &quot;have&quot; lines advertising
  the IDs of objects it has that are not explicitly intended to be shared but
  can be used to optimize the transfer if the peer also has them. The attacker
  chooses an object ID X to steal and sends a ref to X, but isn&#x2019;t
  required to send the content of X because the victim already has it. Now the
  victim believes that the attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back to
  the attacker later. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to
  perform on a server, by creating a ref to X in the namespace the client has
  access to and then fetching it. The most likely way for a server to perform it
  on a client is to &quot;merge&quot; X into a public branch and hope that the
  user does additional work on this branch and pushes it back to the server
  without noticing the merge.)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to
  steal. The victim sends an object Y that the attacker already has, and the
  attacker falsely claims to have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a delta
  against X. The delta reveals regions of X that are similar to Y to the
  attacker.</div>
