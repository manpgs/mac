<p class="Pp">Hostnames are domains, where a domain is a hierarchical,
    dot-separated list of subdomains; for example, the machine monet, in the
    Berkeley subdomain of the EDU subdomain of the Internet would be represented
    as</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">monet.Berkeley.EDU</code></div>
<p class="Pp">(with no trailing dot).</p>
<p class="Pp">Hostnames are often used with network client and server programs,
    which must generally translate the name to an address for use. (This
    function is generally performed by the library routine
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/gethostbyname">gethostbyname(3)</a>.) Hostnames are
    resolved by the Internet name resolver in the following fashion.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the name consists of a single component, i.e., contains no dot,
    and if the environment variable
    &#x201C;<code class="Ev">HOSTALIASES</code>&#x201D; is set to the name of a
    file, that file is searched for any string matching the input hostname. The
    file should consist of lines made up of two white-space separated strings,
    the first of which is the hostname alias, and the second of which is the
    complete hostname to be substituted for that alias. If a case-insensitive
    match is found between the hostname to be resolved and the first field of a
    line in the file, the substituted name is looked up with no further
    processing.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the input name ends with a trailing dot, the trailing dot is
    removed, and the remaining name is looked up with no further processing.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the input name does not end with a trailing dot, it is looked
    up by searching through a list of domains until a match is found. The
    default search list includes first the local domain, then its parent domains
    with at least 2 name components (longest first). For example, in the domain
    CS.Berkeley.EDU, the name lithium.CChem will be checked first as
    lithium.CChem.CS.Berkeley.EDU and then as lithium.CChem.Berkeley.EDU.
    Lithium.CChem.EDU will not be tried, as there is only one component
    remaining from the local domain. The search path can be changed from the
    default by a system-wide configuration file (see
    <a class="Xr" href="../5/resolver">resolver(5)</a>).</p>
