<p class="Pp">You should work through <b>gittutorial</b>(7) before reading this
    tutorial.</p>
<p class="Pp">The goal of this tutorial is to introduce two fundamental pieces
    of Git&#x2019;s architecture&#x2014;the object database and the index
    file&#x2014;and to provide the reader with everything necessary to
    understand the rest of the Git documentation.</p>

<p class="Pp">Let&#x2019;s start a new project and create a small amount of
    history:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ mkdir test-project
$ cd test-project
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
$ echo 'hello world' &gt; file.txt
$ git add .
$ git commit -a -m &quot;initial commit&quot;
[master (root-commit) 54196cc] initial commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 file.txt
$ echo 'hello world!' &gt;file.txt
$ git commit -a -m &quot;add emphasis&quot;

 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">What are the 7 digits of hex that Git responded to the commit
    with?</p>
<p class="Pp">We saw in part one of the tutorial that commits have names like
    this. It turns out that every object in the Git history is stored under a
    40-digit hex name. That name is the SHA-1 hash of the object&#x2019;s
    contents; among other things, this ensures that Git will never store the
    same data twice (since identical data is given an identical SHA-1 name), and
    that the contents of a Git object will never change (since that would change
    the object&#x2019;s name as well). The 7 char hex strings here are simply
    the abbreviation of such 40 character long strings. Abbreviations can be
    used everywhere where the 40 character strings can be used, so long as they
    are unambiguous.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is expected that the content of the commit object you created
    while following the example above generates a different SHA-1 hash than the
    one shown above because the commit object records the time when it was
    created and the name of the person performing the commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">We can ask Git about this particular object with the
    <b>cat-file</b> command. Don&#x2019;t copy the 40 hex digits from this
    example but use those from your own version. Note that you can shorten it to
    only a few characters to save yourself typing all 40 hex digits:</p>

<p class="Pp">A tree can refer to one or more &quot;blob&quot; objects, each
    corresponding to a file. In addition, a tree can also refer to other tree
    objects, thus creating a directory hierarchy. You can examine the contents
    of any tree using ls-tree (remember that a long enough initial portion of
    the SHA-1 will also work):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git ls-tree 92b8b694
100644 blob 3b18e512dba79e4c8300dd08aeb37f8e728b8dad    file.txt
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Thus we see that this tree has one file in it. The SHA-1 hash is a
    reference to that file&#x2019;s data:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git cat-file -t 3b18e512
blob
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">A &quot;blob&quot; is just file data, which we can also examine
    with cat-file:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git cat-file blob 3b18e512
hello world
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Note that this is the old file data; so the object that Git named
    in its response to the initial tree was a tree with a snapshot of the
    directory state that was recorded by the first commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">All of these objects are stored under their SHA-1 names inside the
    Git directory:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ find .git/objects/
.git/objects/
.git/objects/pack

</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">and the contents of these files is just the compressed data plus a
    header identifying their length and their type. The type is either a blob, a
    tree, a commit, or a tag.</p>
<p class="Pp">The simplest commit to find is the HEAD commit, which we can find
    from .git/HEAD:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">As you can see, this tells us which branch we&#x2019;re currently
    on, and it tells us this by naming a file under the .git directory, which
    itself contains a SHA-1 name referring to a commit object, which we can
    examine with cat-file:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ cat .git/refs/heads/master

<p class="Pp">The &quot;tree&quot; object here refers to the new state of the

<div class="Bd-indent">

$ git ls-tree d0492b36

$ git cat-file blob a0423896
hello world!
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">and the &quot;parent&quot; object refers to the previous
  commit:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

initial commit
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The tree object is the tree we examined first, and this commit is
    unusual in that it lacks any parent.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most commits have only one parent, but it is also common for a
    commit to have multiple parents. In that case the commit represents a merge,
    with the parent references pointing to the heads of the merged branches.</p>
<p class="Pp">Besides blobs, trees, and commits, the only remaining type of
    object is a &quot;tag&quot;, which we won&#x2019;t discuss here; refer to
    <b>git-tag</b>(1) for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">So now we know how Git uses the object database to represent a
    project&#x2019;s history:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&quot;commit&quot; objects refer to
  &quot;tree&quot; objects representing the snapshot of a directory tree at a
  particular point in the history, and refer to &quot;parent&quot; commits to
  show how they&#x2019;re connected into the project history.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&quot;tree&quot; objects represent the state of a
  single directory, associating directory names to &quot;blob&quot; objects
  containing file data and &quot;tree&quot; objects containing subdirectory
  information.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&quot;blob&quot; objects contain file data
  without any other structure.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;References to commit objects at the head of each
  branch are stored in files under .git/refs/heads/.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The name of the current branch is stored in
  .git/HEAD.</div>
<p class="Pp">Note, by the way, that lots of commands take a tree as an
    argument. But as we can see above, a tree can be referred to in many
    different ways&#x2014;by the SHA-1 name for that tree, by the name of a
    commit that refers to the tree, by the name of a branch whose head refers to
    that tree, etc.--and most such commands can accept any of these names.</p>
<p class="Pp">In command synopses, the word &quot;tree-ish&quot; is sometimes
    used to designate such an argument.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="THE_INDEX_FILE"><a class="permalink" href="#THE_INDEX_FILE">THE

<p class="Pp">The primary tool we&#x2019;ve been using to create commits is
    <b>git-commit -a</b>, which creates a commit including every change
    you&#x2019;ve made to your working tree. But what if you want to commit
    changes only to certain files? Or only certain changes to certain files?</p>
<p class="Pp">If we look at the way commits are created under the cover,
    we&#x2019;ll see that there are more flexible ways creating commits.</p>
<p class="Pp">Continuing with our test-project, let&#x2019;s modify file.txt
    again:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ echo &quot;hello world, again&quot; &gt;&gt;file.txt
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">but this time instead of immediately making the commit,
    let&#x2019;s take an intermediate step, and ask for diffs along the way to
    keep track of what&#x2019;s happening:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git diff
--- a/file.txt
+++ b/file.txt
@@ -1 +1,2 @@
 hello world!
+hello world, again
$ git add file.txt
$ git diff
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The last diff is empty, but no new commits have been made, and the
    head still doesn&#x2019;t contain the new line:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git diff HEAD

<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">So <i>git diff</i> is comparing against something other than the
    head. The thing that it&#x2019;s comparing against is actually the index
    file, which is stored in .git/index in a binary format, but whose contents
    we can examine with ls-files:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git ls-files --stage

    reference to it in the index file. If we modify the file again, we&#x2019;ll
    see that the new modifications are reflected in the <i>git diff</i>
  output:</p>

<p class="Pp">So by default <i>git commit</i> uses the index to create the
    commit, not the working tree; the &quot;-a&quot; option to commit tells it
    to first update the index with all changes in the working tree.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, it&#x2019;s worth looking at the effect of <i>git add</i>
    on the index file:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ echo &quot;goodbye, world&quot; &gt;closing.txt
$ git add closing.txt
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The effect of the <i>git add</i> was to add one entry to the index
    file:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git ls-files --stage
100644 8b9743b20d4b15be3955fc8d5cd2b09cd2336138 0       closing.txt
100644 513feba2e53ebbd2532419ded848ba19de88ba00 0       file.txt
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">And, as you can see with cat-file, this new entry refers to the
    current contents of the file:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git cat-file blob 8b9743b2
goodbye, world
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;status&quot; command is a useful way to get a quick
    summary of the situation:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
        new file:   closing.txt
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   file.txt
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Since the current state of closing.txt is cached in the index
    file, it is listed as &quot;Changes to be committed&quot;. Since file.txt
    has changes in the working directory that aren&#x2019;t reflected in the
    index, it is marked &quot;changed but not updated&quot;. At this point,
    running &quot;git commit&quot; would create a commit that added closing.txt
    (with its new contents), but that didn&#x2019;t modify file.txt.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also, note that a bare <b>git diff</b> shows the changes to
    file.txt, but not the addition of closing.txt, because the version of
    closing.txt in the index file is identical to the one in the working
    directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to being the staging area for new commits, the index
    file is also populated from the object database when checking out a branch,
    and is used to hold the trees involved in a merge operation. See
    <b>gitcore-tutorial</b>(7) and the relevant man pages for details.</p>
