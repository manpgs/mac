<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This document attempts to write down and motivate some of the
    workflow elements used for <b>git.git</b> itself. Many ideas apply in
    general, though the full workflow is rarely required for smaller projects
    with fewer people involved.</p>
<p class="Pp">We formulate a set of <i>rules</i> for quick reference, while the
    prose tries to motivate each of them. Do not always take them literally; you
    should value good reasons for your actions higher than manpages such as this
    one.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SEPARATE_CHANGES"><a class="permalink" href="#SEPARATE_CHANGES">SEPARATE
  CHANGES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">As a general rule, you should try to split your changes into small
    logical steps, and commit each of them. They should be consistent, working
    independently of any later commits, pass the test suite, etc. This makes the
    review process much easier, and the history much more useful for later
    inspection and analysis, for example with <b>git-blame</b>(1) and
    <b>git-bisect</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">To achieve this, try to split your work into small steps from the
    very beginning. It is always easier to squash a few commits together than to
    split one big commit into several. Don&#x2019;t be afraid of making too
    small or imperfect steps along the way. You can always go back later and
    edit the commits with <b>git rebase --interactive</b> before you publish
    them. You can use <b>git stash push --keep-index</b> to run the test suite
    independent of other uncommitted changes; see the EXAMPLES section of
    <b>git-stash</b>(1).</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MANAGING_BRANCHES"><a class="permalink" href="#MANAGING_BRANCHES">MANAGING
  BRANCHES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">There are two main tools that can be used to include changes from
    one branch on another: <b>git-merge</b>(1) and
  <b>git-cherry-pick</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">Merges have many advantages, so we try to solve as many problems
    as possible with merges alone. Cherry-picking is still occasionally useful;
    see &quot;Merging upwards&quot; below for an example.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most importantly, merging works at the branch level, while
    cherry-picking works at the commit level. This means that a merge can carry
    over the changes from 1, 10, or 1000 commits with equal ease, which in turn
    means the workflow scales much better to a large number of contributors (and
    contributions). Merges are also easier to understand because a merge commit
    is a &quot;promise&quot; that all changes from all its parents are now
    included.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is a tradeoff of course: merges require a more careful
    branch management. The following subsections discuss the important
  points.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Graduation"><a class="permalink" href="#Graduation">Graduation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As a given feature goes from experimental to stable, it also
    &quot;graduates&quot; between the corresponding branches of the software.
    <b>git.git</b> uses the following <i>integration branches</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>maint</i> tracks the commits that should go
  into the next &quot;maintenance release&quot;, i.e., update of the last
  released stable version;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>master</i> tracks the commits that should go
  into the next release;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>next</i> is intended as a testing branch for
  topics being tested for stability for master.</div>
<p class="Pp">There is a fourth official branch that is used slightly
    differently:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>seen</i> (patches seen by the maintainer) is
  an integration branch for things that are not quite ready for inclusion yet
  (see &quot;Integration Branches&quot; below).</div>
<p class="Pp">Each of the four branches is usually a direct descendant of the
    one above it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Conceptually, the feature enters at an unstable branch (usually
    <i>next</i> or <i>seen</i>), and &quot;graduates&quot; to <i>master</i> for
    the next release once it is considered stable enough.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Merging_upwards"><a class="permalink" href="#Merging_upwards">Merging
  upwards</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;downwards graduation&quot; discussed above cannot be
    done by actually merging downwards, however, since that would merge
    <i>all</i> changes on the unstable branch into the stable one. Hence the
    following:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Example&#x00A0;1.&#x00A0;Merge upwards</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Always commit your fixes to the oldest supported branch that
    requires them. Then (periodically) merge the integration branches upwards
    into each other.</p>
<p class="Pp">This gives a very controlled flow of fixes. If you notice that you
    have applied a fix to e.g. <i>master</i> that is also required in
    <i>maint</i>, you will need to cherry-pick it (using
    <b>git-cherry-pick</b>(1)) downwards. This will happen a few times and is
    nothing to worry about unless you do it very frequently.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Topic_branches"><a class="permalink" href="#Topic_branches">Topic
  branches</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Any nontrivial feature will require several patches to implement,
    and may get extra bugfixes or improvements during its lifetime.</p>
<p class="Pp">Committing everything directly on the integration branches leads
    to many problems: Bad commits cannot be undone, so they must be reverted one
    by one, which creates confusing histories and further error potential when
    you forget to revert part of a group of changes. Working in parallel mixes
    up the changes, creating further confusion.</p>
<p class="Pp">Use of &quot;topic branches&quot; solves these problems. The name
    is pretty self explanatory, with a caveat that comes from the &quot;merge
    upwards&quot; rule above:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Example&#x00A0;2.&#x00A0;Topic branches</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Make a side branch for every topic (feature, bugfix, ...). Fork it
    off at the oldest integration branch that you will eventually want to merge
    it into.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many things can then be done very naturally:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;To get the feature/bugfix into an integration
  branch, simply merge it. If the topic has evolved further in the meantime,
  merge again. (Note that you do not necessarily have to merge it to the oldest
  integration branch first. For example, you can first merge a bugfix to
  <i>next</i>, give it some testing time, and merge to <i>maint</i> when you
  know it is stable.)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If you find you need new features from the branch
  <i>other</i> to continue working on your topic, merge <i>other</i> to
  <i>topic</i>. (However, do not do this &quot;just habitually&quot;, see
  below.)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If you find you forked off the wrong branch and
  want to move it &quot;back in time&quot;, use <b>git-rebase</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that the last point clashes with the other two: a topic that
    has been merged elsewhere should not be rebased. See the section on
    RECOVERING FROM UPSTREAM REBASE in <b>git-rebase</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">We should point out that &quot;habitually&quot; (regularly for no
    real reason) merging an integration branch into your topics &#x2014; and by
    extension, merging anything upstream into anything downstream on a regular
    basis &#x2014; is frowned upon:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Example&#x00A0;3.&#x00A0;Merge to downstream only at
    well-defined points</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Do not merge to downstream except with a good reason: upstream API
    changes affect your branch; your branch no longer merges to upstream
    cleanly; etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">Otherwise, the topic that was merged to suddenly contains more
    than a single (well-separated) change. The many resulting small merges will
    greatly clutter up history. Anyone who later investigates the history of a
    file will have to find out whether that merge affected the topic in
    development. An upstream might even inadvertently be merged into a
    &quot;more stable&quot; branch. And so on.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Throw"><a class="permalink" href="#Throw">Throw-away
  integration</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If you followed the last paragraph, you will now have many small
    topic branches, and occasionally wonder how they interact. Perhaps the
    result of merging them does not even work? But on the other hand, we want to
    avoid merging them anywhere &quot;stable&quot; because such merges cannot
    easily be undone.</p>
<p class="Pp">The solution, of course, is to make a merge that we can undo:
    merge into a throw-away branch.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Example&#x00A0;4.&#x00A0;Throw-away integration
  branches</b></p>
<p class="Pp">To test the interaction of several topics, merge them into a
    throw-away branch. You must never base any work on such a branch!</p>
<p class="Pp">If you make it (very) clear that this branch is going to be
    deleted right after the testing, you can even publish this branch, for
    example to give the testers a chance to work with it, or other developers a
    chance to see if their in-progress work will be compatible. <b>git.git</b>
    has such an official throw-away integration branch called <i>seen</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Branch_management_for_a_release"><a class="permalink" href="#Branch_management_for_a_release">Branch
  management for a release</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Assuming you are using the merge approach discussed above, when
    you are releasing your project you will need to do some additional branch
    management work.</p>
<p class="Pp">A feature release is created from the <i>master</i> branch, since
    <i>master</i> tracks the commits that should go into the next feature
    release.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>master</i> branch is supposed to be a superset of
    <i>maint</i>. If this condition does not hold, then <i>maint</i> contains
    some commits that are not included on <i>master</i>. The fixes represented
    by those commits will therefore not be included in your feature release.</p>
<p class="Pp">To verify that <i>master</i> is indeed a superset of <i>maint</i>,
    use git log:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Example&#x00A0;5.&#x00A0;Verify </b><i>master</i> is a superset
    of <i>maint</i></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git log master..maint</b></p>
<p class="Pp">This command should not list any commits. Otherwise, check out
    <i>master</i> and merge <i>maint</i> into it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now you can proceed with the creation of the feature release.
    Apply a tag to the tip of <i>master</i> indicating the release version:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Example&#x00A0;6.&#x00A0;Release tagging</b></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git tag -s -m &quot;Git X.Y.Z&quot; vX.Y.Z master</b></p>
<p class="Pp">You need to push the new tag to a public Git server (see
    &quot;DISTRIBUTED WORKFLOWS&quot; below). This makes the tag available to
    others tracking your project. The push could also trigger a post-update hook
    to perform release-related items such as building release tarballs and
    preformatted documentation pages.</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, for a maintenance release, <i>maint</i> is tracking the
    commits to be released. Therefore, in the steps above simply tag and push
    <i>maint</i> rather than <i>master</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Maintenance_branch_management_after_a_feature_release"><a class="permalink" href="#Maintenance_branch_management_after_a_feature_release">Maintenance
  branch management after a feature release</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">After a feature release, you need to manage your maintenance
    branches.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, if you wish to continue to release maintenance fixes for
    the feature release made before the recent one, then you must create another
    branch to track commits for that previous release.</p>
<p class="Pp">To do this, the current maintenance branch is copied to another
    branch named with the previous release version number (e.g. maint-X.Y.(Z-1)
    where X.Y.Z is the current release).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Example&#x00A0;7.&#x00A0;Copy maint</b></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git branch maint-X.Y.(Z-1) maint</b></p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>maint</i> branch should now be fast-forwarded to the newly
    released code so that maintenance fixes can be tracked for the current
    release:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Example&#x00A0;8.&#x00A0;Update maint to new release</b></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>git checkout maint</b></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>git merge --ff-only master</b></div>
<p class="Pp">If the merge fails because it is not a fast-forward, then it is
    possible some fixes on <i>maint</i> were missed in the feature release. This
    will not happen if the content of the branches was verified as described in
    the previous section.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Branch_management_for_next_and_seen_after_a_feature_release"><a class="permalink" href="#Branch_management_for_next_and_seen_after_a_feature_release">Branch
  management for next and seen after a feature release</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">After a feature release, the integration branch <i>next</i> may
    optionally be rewound and rebuilt from the tip of <i>master</i> using the
    surviving topics on <i>next</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Example&#x00A0;9.&#x00A0;Rewind and rebuild next</b></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>git switch -C next master</b></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>git merge ai/topic_in_next1</b></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>git merge ai/topic_in_next2</b></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;...</div>
<p class="Pp">The advantage of doing this is that the history of <i>next</i>
    will be clean. For example, some topics merged into <i>next</i> may have
    initially looked promising, but were later found to be undesirable or
    premature. In such a case, the topic is reverted out of <i>next</i> but the
    fact remains in the history that it was once merged and reverted. By
    recreating <i>next</i>, you give another incarnation of such topics a clean
    slate to retry, and a feature release is a good point in history to do
  so.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you do this, then you should make a public announcement
    indicating that <i>next</i> was rewound and rebuilt.</p>
<p class="Pp">The same rewind and rebuild process may be followed for
    <i>seen</i>. A public announcement is not necessary since <i>seen</i> is a
    throw-away branch, as described above.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DISTRIBUTED_WORKFLOWS"><a class="permalink" href="#DISTRIBUTED_WORKFLOWS">DISTRIBUTED
  WORKFLOWS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">After the last section, you should know how to manage topics. In
    general, you will not be the only person working on the project, so you will
    have to share your work.</p>
<p class="Pp">Roughly speaking, there are two important workflows: merge and
    patch. The important difference is that the merge workflow can propagate
    full history, including merges, while patches cannot. Both workflows can be
    used in parallel: in <b>git.git</b>, only subsystem maintainers use the
    merge workflow, while everyone else sends patches.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the maintainer(s) may impose restrictions, such as
    &quot;Signed-off-by&quot; requirements, that all commits/patches submitted
    for inclusion must adhere to. Consult your project&#x2019;s documentation
    for more information.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Merge_workflow"><a class="permalink" href="#Merge_workflow">Merge
  workflow</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The merge workflow works by copying branches between upstream and
    downstream. Upstream can merge contributions into the official history;
    downstream base their work on the official history.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are three main tools that can be used for this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>git-push</b>(1) copies your branches to a
  remote repository, usually to one that can be read by all involved
  parties;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>git-fetch</b>(1) that copies remote branches
  to your repository; and</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>git-pull</b>(1) that does fetch and merge in
  one go.</div>
<p class="Pp">Note the last point. Do <i>not</i> use <i>git pull</i> unless you
    actually want to merge the remote branch.</p>
<p class="Pp">Getting changes out is easy:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Example&#x00A0;10.&#x00A0;Push/pull: Publishing
    branches/topics</b></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</b> and tell everyone
    where they can fetch from.</p>
<p class="Pp">You will still have to tell people by other means, such as mail.
    (Git provides the <b>git-request-pull</b>(1) to send preformatted pull
    requests to upstream maintainers to simplify this task.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If you just want to get the newest copies of the integration
    branches, staying up to date is easy too:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Example&#x00A0;11.&#x00A0;Push/pull: Staying up to date</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Use <b>git fetch &lt;remote&gt;</b> or <b>git remote update</b> to
    stay up to date.</p>
<p class="Pp">Then simply fork your topic branches from the stable remotes as
    explained earlier.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are a maintainer and would like to merge other
    people&#x2019;s topic branches to the integration branches, they will
    typically send a request to do so by mail. Such a request looks like</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
Please pull from
    &lt;url&gt; &lt;branch&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">In that case, <i>git pull</i> can do the fetch and merge in one
    go, as follows.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Example&#x00A0;12.&#x00A0;Push/pull: Merging remote
  topics</b></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git pull &lt;url&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Occasionally, the maintainer may get merge conflicts when they try
    to pull changes from downstream. In this case, they can ask downstream to do
    the merge and resolve the conflicts themselves (perhaps they will know
    better how to resolve them). It is one of the rare cases where downstream
    <i>should</i> merge from upstream.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Patch_workflow"><a class="permalink" href="#Patch_workflow">Patch
  workflow</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If you are a contributor that sends changes upstream in the form
    of emails, you should use topic branches as usual (see above). Then use
    <b>git-format-patch</b>(1) to generate the corresponding emails (highly
    recommended over manually formatting them because it makes the
    maintainer&#x2019;s life easier).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Example&#x00A0;13.&#x00A0;format-patch/am: Publishing
    branches/topics</b></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>git format-patch -M upstream..topic</b> to
  turn them into preformatted patch files</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>git send-email --to=&lt;recipient&gt;
  &lt;patches&gt;</b></div>
<p class="Pp">See the <b>git-format-patch</b>(1) and <b>git-send-email</b>(1)
    manpages for further usage notes.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the maintainer tells you that your patch no longer applies to
    the current upstream, you will have to rebase your topic (you cannot use a
    merge because you cannot format-patch merges):</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Example&#x00A0;14.&#x00A0;format-patch/am: Keeping topics up to
    date</b></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git pull --rebase &lt;url&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</b></p>
<p class="Pp">You can then fix the conflicts during the rebase. Presumably you
    have not published your topic other than by mail, so rebasing it is not a
    problem.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you receive such a patch series (as maintainer, or perhaps as a
    reader of the mailing list it was sent to), save the mails to files, create
    a new topic branch and use <i>git am</i> to import the commits:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Example&#x00A0;15.&#x00A0;format-patch/am: Importing
    patches</b></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git am &lt; patch</b></p>
<p class="Pp">One feature worth pointing out is the three-way merge, which can
    help if you get conflicts: <b>git am -3</b> will use index information
    contained in patches to figure out the merge base. See <b>git-am</b>(1) for
    other options.</p>
