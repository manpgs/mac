<p class="Pp">A special file mode, called the
    <a class="permalink" href="#sticky"><i class="Em" id="sticky">sticky
    bit</i></a> (mode S_ISVTX), is used to indicate special treatment for
    directories. It is ignored for regular files. See
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/chmod">chmod(2)</a> or the file
    <code class="In">&lt;<a class="In">sys/stat.h</a>&gt;</code> for an
    explanation of file modes.</p>

  DIRECTORIES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A directory whose `sticky bit' is set becomes an append-only
    directory, or, more accurately, a directory in which the deletion of files
    is restricted. A file in a sticky directory may only be removed or renamed
    by a user if the user has write permission for the directory and the user is
    the owner of the file, the owner of the directory, or the super-user. This
    feature is usefully applied to directories such as
    <span class="Pa">/tmp</span> which must be publicly writable but should deny
    users the license to arbitrarily delete or rename each others' files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any user may create a sticky directory. See
    <a class="Xr" href="../1/chmod">chmod(1)</a> for details about modifying
    file modes.</p>
