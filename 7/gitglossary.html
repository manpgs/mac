<p class="Pp">alternate object database</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Via the alternates mechanism, a repository can inherit
  part of its object database from another object database, which is called an
  &quot;alternate&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">bare repository</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A bare repository is normally an appropriately named
  directory with a <b>.git</b> suffix that does not have a locally checked-out
  copy of any of the files under revision control. That is, all of the Git
  administrative and control files that would normally be present in the hidden
  <b>.git</b> sub-directory are directly present in the <b>repository.git</b>
  directory instead, and no other files are present and checked out. Usually
  publishers of public repositories make bare repositories available.</div>
<p class="Pp">blob object</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Untyped object, e.g. the contents of a file.</div>
<p class="Pp">branch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A &quot;branch&quot; is a line of development. The most
  recent commit on a branch is referred to as the tip of that branch. The tip of
  the branch is referenced by a branch head, which moves forward as additional
  development is done on the branch. A single Git repository can track an
  arbitrary number of branches, but your working tree is associated with just
  one of them (the &quot;current&quot; or &quot;checked out&quot; branch), and
  HEAD points to that branch.</div>
<p class="Pp">cache</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Obsolete for: index.</div>
<p class="Pp">chain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A list of objects, where each object in the list contains
  a reference to its successor (for example, the successor of a commit could be
  one of its parents).</div>
<p class="Pp">changeset</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">BitKeeper/cvsps speak for &quot;commit&quot;. Since Git
  does not store changes, but states, it really does not make sense to use the
  term &quot;changesets&quot; with Git.</div>
<p class="Pp">checkout</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The action of updating all or part of the working tree
  with a tree object or blob from the object database, and updating the index
  and HEAD if the whole working tree has been pointed at a new branch.</div>
<p class="Pp">cherry-picking</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In SCM jargon, &quot;cherry pick&quot; means to choose a
  subset of changes out of a series of changes (typically commits) and record
  them as a new series of changes on top of a different codebase. In Git, this
  is performed by the &quot;git cherry-pick&quot; command to extract the change
  introduced by an existing commit and to record it based on the tip of the
  current branch as a new commit.</div>
<p class="Pp">clean</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A working tree is clean, if it corresponds to the
  revision referenced by the current head. Also see &quot;dirty&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">commit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">As a noun: A single point in the Git history; the entire
  history of a project is represented as a set of interrelated commits. The word
  &quot;commit&quot; is often used by Git in the same places other revision
  control systems use the words &quot;revision&quot; or &quot;version&quot;.
  Also used as a short hand for commit object.
<p class="Pp">As a verb: The action of storing a new snapshot of the
    project&#x2019;s state in the Git history, by creating a new commit
    representing the current state of the index and advancing HEAD to point at
    the new commit.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">commit object</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An object which contains the information about a
  particular revision, such as parents, committer, author, date and the tree
  object which corresponds to the top directory of the stored revision.</div>
<p class="Pp">commit-ish (also committish)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A commit object or an object that can be recursively
  dereferenced to a commit object. The following are all commit-ishes: a commit
  object, a tag object that points to a commit object, a tag object that points
  to a tag object that points to a commit object, etc.</div>
<p class="Pp">core Git</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Fundamental data structures and utilities of Git. Exposes
  only limited source code management tools.</div>
<p class="Pp">DAG</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Directed acyclic graph. The commit objects form a
  directed acyclic graph, because they have parents (directed), and the graph of
  commit objects is acyclic (there is no chain which begins and ends with the
  same object).</div>
<p class="Pp">dangling object</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An unreachable object which is not reachable even from
  other unreachable objects; a dangling object has no references to it from any
  reference or object in the repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">detached HEAD</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Normally the HEAD stores the name of a branch, and
  commands that operate on the history HEAD represents operate on the history
  leading to the tip of the branch the HEAD points at. However, Git also allows
  you to check out an arbitrary commit that isn&#x2019;t necessarily the tip of
  any particular branch. The HEAD in such a state is called
  &quot;detached&quot;.
<p class="Pp">Note that commands that operate on the history of the current
    branch (e.g. <b>git commit</b> to build a new history on top of it) still
    work while the HEAD is detached. They update the HEAD to point at the tip of
    the updated history without affecting any branch. Commands that update or
    inquire information <i>about</i> the current branch (e.g. <b>git branch
    --set-upstream-to</b> that sets what remote-tracking branch the current
    branch integrates with) obviously do not work, as there is no (real) current
    branch to ask about in this state.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">directory</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The list you get with &quot;ls&quot; :-)</div>
<p class="Pp">dirty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A working tree is said to be &quot;dirty&quot; if it
  contains modifications which have not been committed to the current
  branch.</div>
<p class="Pp">evil merge</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An evil merge is a merge that introduces changes that do
  not appear in any parent.</div>
<p class="Pp">fast-forward</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A fast-forward is a special type of merge where you have
  a revision and you are &quot;merging&quot; another branch's changes that
  happen to be a descendant of what you have. In such a case, you do not make a
  new merge commit but instead just update to his revision. This will happen
  frequently on a remote-tracking branch of a remote repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">fetch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Fetching a branch means to get the branch&#x2019;s head
  ref from a remote repository, to find out which objects are missing from the
  local object database, and to get them, too. See also
  <b>git-fetch</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">file system</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Linus Torvalds originally designed Git to be a user space
  file system, i.e. the infrastructure to hold files and directories. That
  ensured the efficiency and speed of Git.</div>
<p class="Pp">Git archive</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for repository (for arch people).</div>
<p class="Pp">gitfile</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A plain file <b>.git</b> at the root of a working tree
  that points at the directory that is the real repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">grafts</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Grafts enables two otherwise different lines of
  development to be joined together by recording fake ancestry information for
  commits. This way you can make Git pretend the set of parents a commit has is
  different from what was recorded when the commit was created. Configured via
  the <b>.git/info/grafts</b> file.
<p class="Pp">Note that the grafts mechanism is outdated and can lead to
    problems transferring objects between repositories; see
    <b>git-replace</b>(1) for a more flexible and robust system to do the same
    thing.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">hash</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In Git&#x2019;s context, synonym for object name.</div>
<p class="Pp">head</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A named reference to the commit at the tip of a branch.
  Heads are stored in a file in <b>$GIT_DIR/refs/heads/</b> directory, except
  when using packed refs. (See <b>git-pack-refs</b>(1).)</div>
<p class="Pp">HEAD</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The current branch. In more detail: Your working tree is
  normally derived from the state of the tree referred to by HEAD. HEAD is a
  reference to one of the heads in your repository, except when using a detached
  HEAD, in which case it directly references an arbitrary commit.</div>
<p class="Pp">head ref</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A synonym for head.</div>
<p class="Pp">hook</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">During the normal execution of several Git commands,
  call-outs are made to optional scripts that allow a developer to add
  functionality or checking. Typically, the hooks allow for a command to be
  pre-verified and potentially aborted, and allow for a post-notification after
  the operation is done. The hook scripts are found in the
  <b>$GIT_DIR/hooks/</b> directory, and are enabled by simply removing the
  <b>.sample</b> suffix from the filename. In earlier versions of Git you had to
  make them executable.</div>
<p class="Pp">index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A collection of files with stat information, whose
  contents are stored as objects. The index is a stored version of your working
  tree. Truth be told, it can also contain a second, and even a third version of
  a working tree, which are used when merging.</div>
<p class="Pp">index entry</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The information regarding a particular file, stored in
  the index. An index entry can be unmerged, if a merge was started, but not yet
  finished (i.e. if the index contains multiple versions of that file).</div>
<p class="Pp">master</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default development branch. Whenever you create a Git
  repository, a branch named &quot;master&quot; is created, and becomes the
  active branch. In most cases, this contains the local development, though that
  is purely by convention and is not required.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">As a verb: To bring the contents of another branch
  (possibly from an external repository) into the current branch. In the case
  where the merged-in branch is from a different repository, this is done by
  first fetching the remote branch and then merging the result into the current
  branch. This combination of fetch and merge operations is called a pull.
  Merging is performed by an automatic process that identifies changes made
  since the branches diverged, and then applies all those changes together. In
  cases where changes conflict, manual intervention may be required to complete
  the merge.
<p class="Pp">As a noun: unless it is a fast-forward, a successful merge results
    in the creation of a new commit representing the result of the merge, and
    having as parents the tips of the merged branches. This commit is referred
    to as a &quot;merge commit&quot;, or sometimes just a &quot;merge&quot;.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">object</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The unit of storage in Git. It is uniquely identified by
  the SHA-1 of its contents. Consequently, an object cannot be changed.</div>
<p class="Pp">object database</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Stores a set of &quot;objects&quot;, and an individual
  object is identified by its object name. The objects usually live in
  <b>$GIT_DIR/objects/</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">object identifier</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for object name.</div>
<p class="Pp">object name</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The unique identifier of an object. The object name is
  usually represented by a 40 character hexadecimal string. Also colloquially
  called SHA-1.</div>
<p class="Pp">object type</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">One of the identifiers &quot;commit&quot;,
  &quot;tree&quot;, &quot;tag&quot; or &quot;blob&quot; describing the type of
  an object.</div>
<p class="Pp">octopus</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">To merge more than two branches.</div>
<p class="Pp">origin</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default upstream repository. Most projects have at
  least one upstream project which they track. By default <i>origin</i> is used
  for that purpose. New upstream updates will be fetched into remote-tracking
  branches named origin/name-of-upstream-branch, which you can see using <b>git
  branch -r</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">overlay</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only update and add files to the working directory, but
  don&#x2019;t delete them, similar to how <i>cp -R</i> would update the
  contents in the destination directory. This is the default mode in a checkout
  when checking out files from the index or a tree-ish. In contrast, no-overlay
  mode also deletes tracked files not present in the source, similar to <i>rsync
  --delete</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">pack</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A set of objects which have been compressed into one file
  (to save space or to transmit them efficiently).</div>
<p class="Pp">pack index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The list of identifiers, and other information, of the
  objects in a pack, to assist in efficiently accessing the contents of a
  pack.</div>
<p class="Pp">pathspec</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pattern used to limit paths in Git commands.
<p class="Pp">Pathspecs are used on the command line of &quot;git
    ls-files&quot;, &quot;git ls-tree&quot;, &quot;git add&quot;, &quot;git
    grep&quot;, &quot;git diff&quot;, &quot;git checkout&quot;, and many other
    commands to limit the scope of operations to some subset of the tree or
    worktree. See the documentation of each command for whether paths are
    relative to the current directory or toplevel. The pathspec syntax is as
    follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;any path matches itself</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the pathspec up to the last slash represents a
  directory prefix. The scope of that pathspec is limited to that subtree.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the rest of the pathspec is a pattern for the
  remainder of the pathname. Paths relative to the directory prefix will be
  matched against that pattern using fnmatch(3); in particular, <i>*</i> and
  <i>?</i> <i>can</i> match directory separators.</div>
<p class="Pp">For example, Documentation/*.jpg will match all .jpg files in the
    Documentation subtree, including Documentation/chapter_1/figure_1.jpg.</p>
<p class="Pp">A pathspec that begins with a colon <b>:</b> has special meaning.
    In the short form, the leading colon <b>:</b> is followed by zero or more
    &quot;magic signature&quot; letters (which optionally is terminated by
    another colon <b>:</b>), and the remainder is the pattern to match against
    the path. The &quot;magic signature&quot; consists of ASCII symbols that are
    neither alphanumeric, glob, regex special characters nor colon. The optional
    colon that terminates the &quot;magic signature&quot; can be omitted if the
    pattern begins with a character that does not belong to &quot;magic
    signature&quot; symbol set and is not a colon.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the long form, the leading colon <b>:</b> is followed by an
    open parenthesis <b>(</b>, a comma-separated list of zero or more
    &quot;magic words&quot;, and a close parentheses <b>)</b>, and the remainder
    is the pattern to match against the path.</p>
<p class="Pp">A pathspec with only a colon means &quot;there is no
    pathspec&quot;. This form should not be combined with other pathspec.</p>
<p class="Pp">top</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The magic word <b>top</b> (magic signature: <b>/</b>)
  makes the pattern match from the root of the working tree, even when you are
  running the command from inside a subdirectory.</div>
<p class="Pp">literal</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Wildcards in the pattern such as <b>*</b> or <b>?</b> are
  treated as literal characters.</div>
<p class="Pp">icase</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Case insensitive match.</div>
<p class="Pp">glob</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for
  consumption by fnmatch(3) with the FNM_PATHNAME flag: wildcards in the pattern
  will not match a / in the pathname. For example,
  &quot;Documentation/*.html&quot; matches &quot;Documentation/git.html&quot;
  but not &quot;Documentation/ppc/ppc.html&quot; or
  &quot;tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html&quot;.
<p class="Pp">Two consecutive asterisks (&quot;<b>**</b>&quot;) in patterns
    matched against full pathname may have special meaning:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;A leading &quot;<b>**</b>&quot; followed by a
  slash means match in all directories. For example, &quot;<b>**/foo</b>&quot;
  matches file or directory &quot;<b>foo</b>&quot; anywhere, the same as pattern
  &quot;<b>foo</b>&quot;. &quot;<b>**/foo/bar</b>&quot; matches file or
  directory &quot;<b>bar</b>&quot; anywhere that is directly under directory
  &quot;<b>foo</b>&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;A trailing &quot;<b>/**</b>&quot; matches
  everything inside. For example, &quot;<b>abc/**</b>&quot; matches all files
  inside directory &quot;abc&quot;, relative to the location of the
  <b>.gitignore</b> file, with infinite depth.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks
  then a slash matches zero or more directories. For example,
  &quot;<b>a/**/b</b>&quot; matches &quot;<b>a/b</b>&quot;,
  &quot;<b>a/x/b</b>&quot;, &quot;<b>a/x/y/b</b>&quot; and so on.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Other consecutive asterisks are considered
  invalid.
<p class="Pp">Glob magic is incompatible with literal magic.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">attr</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">After <b>attr:</b> comes a space separated list of
  &quot;attribute requirements&quot;, all of which must be met in order for the
  path to be considered a match; this is in addition to the usual non-magic
  pathspec pattern matching. See <b>gitattributes</b>(5).
<p class="Pp">Each of the attribute requirements for the path takes one of these
    forms:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&quot;<b>ATTR</b>&quot; requires that the
  attribute <b>ATTR</b> be set.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&quot;<b>-ATTR</b>&quot; requires that the
  attribute <b>ATTR</b> be unset.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&quot;<b>ATTR=VALUE</b>&quot; requires that the
  attribute <b>ATTR</b> be set to the string <b>VALUE</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&quot;<b>!ATTR</b>&quot; requires that the
  attribute <b>ATTR</b> be unspecified.
<p class="Pp">Note that when matching against a tree object, attributes are
    still obtained from working tree, not from the given tree object.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">exclude</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">After a path matches any non-exclude pathspec, it will be
  run through all exclude pathspecs (magic signature: <b>!</b> or its synonym
  <b>^</b>). If it matches, the path is ignored. When there is no non-exclude
  pathspec, the exclusion is applied to the result set as if invoked without any
  pathspec.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">parent</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A commit object contains a (possibly empty) list of the
  logical predecessor(s) in the line of development, i.e. its parents.</div>
<p class="Pp">pickaxe</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The term pickaxe refers to an option to the diffcore
  routines that help select changes that add or delete a given text string. With
  the <b>--pickaxe-all</b> option, it can be used to view the full changeset
  that introduced or removed, say, a particular line of text. See
  <b>git-diff</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">plumbing</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Cute name for core Git.</div>
<p class="Pp">porcelain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Cute name for programs and program suites depending on
  core Git, presenting a high level access to core Git. Porcelains expose more
  of a SCM interface than the plumbing.</div>
<p class="Pp">per-worktree ref</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Refs that are per-worktree, rather than global. This is
  presently only HEAD and any refs that start with <b>refs/bisect/</b>, but
  might later include other unusual refs.</div>
<p class="Pp">pseudoref</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pseudorefs are a class of files under <b>$GIT_DIR</b>
  which behave like refs for the purposes of rev-parse, but which are treated
  specially by git. Pseudorefs both have names that are all-caps, and always
  start with a line consisting of a SHA-1 followed by whitespace. So, HEAD is
  not a pseudoref, because it is sometimes a symbolic ref. They might optionally
  contain some additional data. <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> and <b>CHERRY_PICK_HEAD</b>
  are examples. Unlike per-worktree refs, these files cannot be symbolic refs,
  and never have reflogs. They also cannot be updated through the normal ref
  update machinery. Instead, they are updated by directly writing to the files.
  However, they can be read as if they were refs, so <b>git rev-parse
  MERGE_HEAD</b> will work.</div>
<p class="Pp">pull</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pulling a branch means to fetch it and merge it. See also
  <b>git-pull</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">push</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pushing a branch means to get the branch&#x2019;s head
  ref from a remote repository, find out if it is an ancestor to the
  branch&#x2019;s local head ref, and in that case, putting all objects, which
  are reachable from the local head ref, and which are missing from the remote
  repository, into the remote object database, and updating the remote head ref.
  If the remote head is not an ancestor to the local head, the push fails.</div>
<p class="Pp">reachable</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">All of the ancestors of a given commit are said to be
  &quot;reachable&quot; from that commit. More generally, one object is
  reachable from another if we can reach the one from the other by a chain that
  follows tags to whatever they tag, commits to their parents or trees, and
  trees to the trees or blobs that they contain.</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">To reapply a series of changes from a branch to a
  different base, and reset the head of that branch to the result.</div>
<p class="Pp">ref</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A name that begins with <b>refs/</b> (e.g.
  <b>refs/heads/master</b>) that points to an object name or another ref (the
  latter is called a symbolic ref). For convenience, a ref can sometimes be
  abbreviated when used as an argument to a Git command; see
  <b>gitrevisions</b>(7) for details. Refs are stored in the repository.
<p class="Pp">The ref namespace is hierarchical. Different subhierarchies are
    used for different purposes (e.g. the <b>refs/heads/</b> hierarchy is used
    to represent local branches).</p>
<p class="Pp">There are a few special-purpose refs that do not begin with
    <b>refs/</b>. The most notable example is <b>HEAD</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">reflog</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A reflog shows the local &quot;history&quot; of a ref. In
  other words, it can tell you what the 3rd last revision in <i>this</i>
  repository was, and what was the current state in <i>this</i> repository,
  yesterday 9:14pm. See <b>git-reflog</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">refspec</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A &quot;refspec&quot; is used by fetch and push to
  describe the mapping between remote ref and local ref.</div>
<p class="Pp">remote repository</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A repository which is used to track the same project but
  resides somewhere else. To communicate with remotes, see fetch or push.</div>
<p class="Pp">remote-tracking branch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A ref that is used to follow changes from another
  repository. It typically looks like <i>refs/remotes/foo/bar</i> (indicating
  that it tracks a branch named <i>bar</i> in a remote named <i>foo</i>), and
  matches the right-hand-side of a configured fetch refspec. A remote-tracking
  branch should not contain direct modifications or have local commits made to
  it.</div>
<p class="Pp">repository</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A collection of refs together with an object database
  containing all objects which are reachable from the refs, possibly accompanied
  by meta data from one or more porcelains. A repository can share an object
  database with other repositories via alternates mechanism.</div>
<p class="Pp">resolve</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The action of fixing up manually what a failed automatic
  merge left behind.</div>
<p class="Pp">revision</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for commit (the noun).</div>
<p class="Pp">rewind</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">To throw away part of the development, i.e. to assign the
  head to an earlier revision.</div>
<p class="Pp">SCM</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Source code management (tool).</div>
<p class="Pp">SHA-1</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&quot;Secure Hash Algorithm 1&quot;; a cryptographic hash
  function. In the context of Git used as a synonym for object name.</div>
<p class="Pp">shallow clone</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Mostly a synonym to shallow repository but the phrase
  makes it more explicit that it was created by running <b>git clone
  --depth=...</b> command.</div>
<p class="Pp">shallow repository</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A shallow repository has an incomplete history some of
  whose commits have parents cauterized away (in other words, Git is told to
  pretend that these commits do not have the parents, even though they are
  recorded in the commit object). This is sometimes useful when you are
  interested only in the recent history of a project even though the real
  history recorded in the upstream is much larger. A shallow repository is
  created by giving the <b>--depth</b> option to <b>git-clone</b>(1), and its
  history can be later deepened with <b>git-fetch</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">stash entry</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An object used to temporarily store the contents of a
  dirty working directory and the index for future reuse.</div>
<p class="Pp">submodule</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A repository that holds the history of a separate project
  inside another repository (the latter of which is called superproject).</div>
<p class="Pp">superproject</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A repository that references repositories of other
  projects in its working tree as submodules. The superproject knows about the
  names of (but does not hold copies of) commit objects of the contained
  submodules.</div>
<p class="Pp">symref</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Symbolic reference: instead of containing the SHA-1 id
  itself, it is of the format <i>ref: refs/some/thing</i> and when referenced,
  it recursively dereferences to this reference. <i>HEAD</i> is a prime example
  of a symref. Symbolic references are manipulated with the
  <b>git-symbolic-ref</b>(1) command.</div>
<p class="Pp">tag</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A ref under <b>refs/tags/</b> namespace that points to an
  object of an arbitrary type (typically a tag points to either a tag or a
  commit object). In contrast to a head, a tag is not updated by the
  <b>commit</b> command. A Git tag has nothing to do with a Lisp tag (which
  would be called an object type in Git&#x2019;s context). A tag is most
  typically used to mark a particular point in the commit ancestry chain.</div>
<p class="Pp">tag object</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An object containing a ref pointing to another object,
  which can contain a message just like a commit object. It can also contain a
  (PGP) signature, in which case it is called a &quot;signed tag
  object&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">topic branch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A regular Git branch that is used by a developer to
  identify a conceptual line of development. Since branches are very easy and
  inexpensive, it is often desirable to have several small branches that each
  contain very well defined concepts or small incremental yet related
  changes.</div>
<p class="Pp">tree</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Either a working tree, or a tree object together with the
  dependent blob and tree objects (i.e. a stored representation of a working
  tree).</div>
<p class="Pp">tree object</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An object containing a list of file names and modes along
  with refs to the associated blob and/or tree objects. A tree is equivalent to
  a directory.</div>
<p class="Pp">tree-ish (also treeish)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A tree object or an object that can be recursively
  dereferenced to a tree object. Dereferencing a commit object yields the tree
  object corresponding to the revision's top directory. The following are all
  tree-ishes: a commit-ish, a tree object, a tag object that points to a tree
  object, a tag object that points to a tag object that points to a tree object,
  etc.</div>
<p class="Pp">unmerged index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An index which contains unmerged index entries.</div>
<p class="Pp">unreachable object</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An object which is not reachable from a branch, tag, or
  any other reference.</div>
<p class="Pp">upstream branch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default branch that is merged into the branch in
  question (or the branch in question is rebased onto). It is configured via
  branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote and branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge. If the upstream
  branch of <i>A</i> is <i>origin/B</i> sometimes we say &quot;<i>A</i> is
  tracking <i>origin/B</i>&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">working tree</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The tree of actual checked out files. The working tree
  normally contains the contents of the HEAD commit&#x2019;s tree, plus any
  local changes that you have made but not yet committed.</div>
