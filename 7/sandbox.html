<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">sandbox</code> facility allows applications
    to voluntarily restrict their access to operating system resources. This
    safety mechanism is intended to limit potential damage in the event that a
    vulnerability is exploited. It is not a replacement for other operating
    system access controls.</p>
<p class="Pp">New processes inherit the <code class="Nm">sandbox</code> of their
    parent. Restrictions are generally enforced upon acquisition of operating
    system resources only. For example, if file system writes are restricted, an
    application will not be able to <a class="Xr" href="../2/open">open(2)</a> a
    file for writing. However, if the application already has a file descriptor
    opened for writing, it may use that file descriptor regardless of
    restrictions.</p>
