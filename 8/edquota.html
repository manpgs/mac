<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">Edquota</code> is a quota editor. By default, or
    if the <code class="Fl">-u</code> flag is specified, one or more users may
    be specified on the command line. For each user a temporary file is created
    with an ASCII representation of the current disk quotas for that user. The
    list of filesystems with user quotas is determined by scanning the mounted
    filesystems for a <span class="Pa">.quota.ops.user</span> file located at
    its root. An editor is invoked on the ASCII file. The editor invoked is
    <a class="Xr" href="../1/vi">vi(1)</a> unless the environment variable
    <code class="Ev">EDITOR</code> specifies otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">The quotas may then be modified, new quotas added, etc. Setting a
    quota to zero indicates that no quota should be imposed. Setting a hard
    limit to one indicates that no allocations should be permitted. Setting a
    soft limit to one with a hard limit of zero indicates that allocations
    should be permitted on only a temporary basis (see
    <code class="Fl">-t</code> below). The current usage information in the file
    is for informational purposes; only the hard and soft limits can be
  changed.</p>
<p class="Pp">On leaving the editor, <code class="Nm">edquota</code> reads the
    temporary file and modifies the binary quota files to reflect the changes
    made. The binary quota file, <span class="Pa">.quota.user</span> is stored
    at the root of the filesystem. The default filename and root location for
    the user quotas cannot be overridden.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <code class="Fl">-p</code> flag is specified,
    <code class="Nm">edquota</code> will duplicate the quotas of the
    prototypical user specified for each user specified. This is the normal
    mechanism used to initialize quotas for groups of users.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <code class="Fl">-g</code> flag is specified,
    <code class="Nm">edquota</code> is invoked to edit the quotas of one or more
    groups specified on the command line. The list of filesystems with group
    quotas is determined by scanning the mounted filesystems for a
    <span class="Pa">.quota.ops.group</span> file located at its root.
    Similarly, the binary quota file, <span class="Pa">.quota.group</span> is
    stored at the root of the filesystem. The default filename and root location
    for group quotas cannot be overridden. The <code class="Fl">-p</code> flag
    can be specified in conjunction with the <code class="Fl">-g</code> flag to
    specify a prototypical group to be duplicated among the listed set of
    groups.</p>
<p class="Pp">Users are permitted to exceed their soft limits for a grace period
    that may be specified per filesystem. Once the grace period has expired, the
    soft limit is enforced as a hard limit. The default grace period for a
    filesystem is specified in <span class="Pa">/usr/include/sys/quota.h</span>.
    The <code class="Fl">-t</code> flag can be used to change the grace period.
    By default, or when invoked with the <code class="Fl">-u</code> flag, the
    grace period is set for each filesystem with a
    <span class="Pa">.quota.ops.user</span> file located at its root. When
    invoked with the <code class="Fl">-g</code> flag, the grace period is set
    for each filesystem with a <span class="Pa">.quota.ops.group</span> file
    located at its root. The grace period may be specified in days, hours,
    minutes, or seconds. Setting a grace period to zero indicates that the
    default grace period should be imposed. Setting a grace period to one second
    indicates that no grace period should be granted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Only the super-user may edit quotas.</p>

<p class="Pp">Each of the following quota files is located at the root of the
    mounted filesystem. The mount option files are empty files whose existence
    indicates that quotas are to be enabled for that filesystem. The binary data
