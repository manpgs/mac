<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">talkd</code> utility is the server that
    notifies a user that someone else wants to initiate a conversation. It acts
    as a repository of invitations, responding to requests by clients wishing to
    rendezvous to hold a conversation. In normal operation, a client, the
    caller, initiates a rendezvous by sending a CTL_MSG to the server of type
    LOOK_UP (see
    <code class="In">&lt;<a class="In">protocols/talkd.h</a>&gt;</code>). This
    causes the server to search its invitation tables to check if an invitation
    currently exists for the caller (to speak to the callee specified in the
    message).</p>
<p class="Pp">If the lookup fails, the caller then sends an ANNOUNCE message
    causing the server to broadcast an announcement on the callee's login ports
    requesting contact.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the callee responds, the local server uses the recorded
    invitation to respond with the appropriate rendezvous address and the caller
    and callee client programs establish a stream connection through which the
    conversation takes place.</p>
