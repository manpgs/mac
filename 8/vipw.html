<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">Vipw</code> edits the password file after setting
    the appropriate locks, and does any necessary processing after the password
    file is unlocked. If the password file is already locked for editing by
    another user, <code class="Nm">vipw</code> will ask you to try again later.
    The default editor for <code class="Nm">vipw</code> is
    <a class="Xr" href="../1/vi">vi(1)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">Vipw</code> performs a number of consistency
    checks on the password entries, and will not allow a password file with a
    &#x201C;mangled&#x201D; entry to be installed. If
    <code class="Nm">vipw</code> rejects the new password file, the user is
    prompted to re-enter the edit session.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once the information has been verified,
    <code class="Nm">vipw</code> uses
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/pwd_mkdb">pwd_mkdb(8)</a> to update the user
    database. This is run in the background, and, at very large sites could take
    several minutes. Until this update is completed, the password file is
    unavailable for other updates and the new information is not available to
    programs.</p>
