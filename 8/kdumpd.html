<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">Kdumpd</code> is a server which receives kernel
    states in the form of a core dump from a remote Mac OS X machine. The kdumpd
    server operates on UDP port 1069, although this may be configurable in the
    future. The server should be started by
    <a class="Xr" href="../1/launchctl">launchctl(1)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The server should have the user ID with the lowest possible
    privilege, usually the user &quot;nobody&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default the server stores kernel cores in the directory
    <span class="Pa">/var/tmp/PanicDumps</span>. The directory needs to already
    exist for kdumpd to save core dumps.</p>
<p class="Pp">The server returns an EEXIST error to the remote kernel if it
    receives a request for an existing file - i.e. only new files can be
    created. The server also disallows path specifications in the incoming file
    name.</p>
