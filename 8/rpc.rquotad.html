<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">rpc.rquotad</code> is an
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/rpc">rpc(3)</a> server which returns quotas for a
    user of a local filesystem which is NFS-mounted onto a remote machine.
    Typically, <a class="Xr" href="../1/quota">quota(1)</a> uses the results to
    display user quotas for remote filesystems.
    <code class="Nm">rpc.rquotad</code> is normally invoked via launchd by the
    NFS server - <a class="Xr" href="../8/nfsd">nfsd(8)</a>. The port that the
    service is made available on can be specified using the
    <code class="Cm">nfs.server.rquota.port</code> option in
    <a class="Xr" href="../5/nfs.conf">nfs.conf(5)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">rpc.rquotad</code> uses an RPC protocol defined
    in <span class="Pa">/usr/include/rpcsvc/rquota.x</span>.</p>
