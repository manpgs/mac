<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">fsck_msdos</code> utility verifies and
    repairs FAT file systems (more commonly known as DOS file systems).</p>
<p class="Pp">The first form of <code class="Nm">fsck_msdos</code> quickly
    checks the specified file systems to determine whether they were cleanly
    unmounted.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second form of <code class="Nm">fsck_msdos</code> preens the
    specified file systems. It is normally started by
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/fsck">fsck(8)</a> run from
    <span class="Pa">/etc/rc.boot</span> during automatic reboot, when a FAT
    file system is detected. When preening file systems,
    <code class="Nm">fsck_msdos</code> will fix common inconsistencies
    non-interactively. If more serious problems are found,
    <code class="Nm">fsck_msdos</code> does not try to fix them, indicates that
    it was not successful, and exits.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third form of <code class="Nm">fsck_msdos</code> checks the
    specified file systems and tries to repair all detected inconsistencies,
    requesting confirmation before making any changes. The default behavior is
    to always ask for confirmation of each change. Use the -n or -y options to
    override this default behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-hang Bd-indent">
  <dt id="q"><a class="permalink" href="#q"><code class="Fl">-q</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Causes <code class="Nm">fsck_msdos</code> to quickly check whether the
      volume was unmounted cleanly. If the volume was unmounted cleanly, then
      the exit status is 0. If the volume was not unmounted cleanly, then the
      exit status will be non-zero. In either case, a message is printed to
      standard output describing whether the volume was clean or dirty.</dd>
  <dt id="f"><a class="permalink" href="#f"><code class="Fl">-f</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This option is ignored by <code class="Nm">fsck_msdos</code> and is
      present only for compatibility with programs that check other file system
      types for consistency.</dd>
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><code class="Fl">-n</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Causes <code class="Nm">fsck_msdos</code> to assume no as the answer to
      all operator questions, except &#x201C;CONTINUE?&#x201D;.</dd>
  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><code class="Fl">-p</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Preen the specified file systems.</dd>
  <dt id="y"><a class="permalink" href="#y"><code class="Fl">-y</code></a></dt>
