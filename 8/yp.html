<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">YP</code> subsystem allows network access to
    directory information hosted by NIS servers. OS X support is provided
    through the functions <a class="Xr" href="../3/getpwent">getpwent(3)</a>,
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/getgrent">getgrent(3)</a>,
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/getfsent">getfsent(3)</a>,
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/getnetgrent">getnetgrent(3)</a>,
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/gethostent">gethostent(3)</a>,
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/getnetent">getnetent(3)</a>,
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/getrpcent">getrpcent(3)</a>,
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/getprotoent">getprotoent(3)</a>,
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/getservent">getservent(3)</a>,
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/ethers">ethers(3)</a> and other related functions.
    Queries to NIS servers are sent by the
    <code class="Nm">opendirectoryd</code> daemon. The configuration of NIS
    clients is further described in the
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/opendirectoryd">opendirectoryd(8)</a> manual
  page.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">YP</code> subsystem is started automatically
    by <a class="Xr" href="../8/launchd">launchd(8)</a> if an NIS domain is
    specified in the <span class="Pa">/etc/defaultdomain</span> configuration
    file, and if the directory <span class="Pa">/var/yp</span> exists (which it
    does in the default distribution).</p>
<p class="Pp">NIS is an RPC-based client/server system that allows a group of
    machines within an NIS domain to share a common set of configuration files.
    This permits a system administrator to set up NIS client systems with only
    minimal configuration data and add, remove or modify configuration data from
    a single location.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="master">The canonical copies of all NIS information are stored
    on a single machine called the NIS
    <a class="permalink" href="#master"><i class="Em">master server</i></a>. The
    databases used to store the information are called NIS
    <a class="permalink" href="#maps"><i class="Em" id="maps">maps</i></a>. A
    single NIS server can support several domains at once, therefore it is
    possible to have several such directories, one for each supported domain.
    Each domain will have its own independent set of maps.</p>
<p class="Pp">Client NIS systems receive all NIS data in ASCII form.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are three main types of NIS systems:</p>
<ol class="Bl-enum">
  <li>NIS clients, which query NIS servers for information.</li>
  <li>NIS master servers, which maintain the canonical copies of all NIS
    maps.</li>
  <li>NIS slave servers, which maintain backup copies of NIS maps that are
      periodically updated by the master.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Pp">OS X systems may be configured as NIS clients, but not as master
    or slave servers.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="binding">A NIS client establishes what is called a
    <a class="permalink" href="#binding"><i class="Em">binding</i></a> to a
    particular NIS server using the
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/ypbind">ypbind(8)</a> daemon. The
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/ypbind">ypbind(8)</a> utility checks the system's
    default domain (as set by the
    <a class="Xr" href="../1/domainname">domainname(1)</a> command) and begins
    broadcasting RPC requests on the local network. These requests specify the
    name of the domain for which <a class="Xr" href="../8/ypbind">ypbind(8)</a>
    is attempting to establish a binding. If a server that has been configured
    to serve the requested domain receives one of the broadcasts, it will
    respond to <a class="Xr" href="../8/ypbind">ypbind(8)</a>, which will record
    the server's address. If there are several servers available (a master and
    several slaves, for example), <a class="Xr" href="../8/ypbind">ypbind(8)</a>
    will use the address of the first one to respond. From that point on, the
    client system will direct all of its NIS requests to that server. The
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/ypbind">ypbind(8)</a> utility will occasionally
    &#x201C;ping&#x201D; the server to make sure it is still up and running. If
    it fails to receive a reply to one of its pings within a reasonable amount
    of time, <a class="Xr" href="../8/ypbind">ypbind(8)</a> will mark the domain
    as unbound and begin broadcasting again in the hopes of locating another
    server.</p>
<p class="Pp">NIS master and slave servers handle all NIS requests with the
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/ypserv">ypserv(8)</a> daemon. The
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/ypserv">ypserv(8)</a> utility is responsible for
    receiving incoming requests from NIS clients, translating the requested
    domain and map name to a path to the corresponding database file and
    transmitting data from the database back to the client. There is a specific
    set of requests that <a class="Xr" href="../8/ypserv">ypserv(8)</a> is
    designed to handle, most of which are implemented as functions within the
    standard system libraries:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="yp_order"><a class="permalink" href="#yp_order"><code class="Fn">yp_order</code></a>()</dt>
  <dd>check the creation date of a particular map</dd>
  <dt id="yp_master"><a class="permalink" href="#yp_master"><code class="Fn">yp_master</code></a>()</dt>
  <dd>obtain the name of the NIS master server for a given map/domain</dd>
  <dt id="yp_match"><a class="permalink" href="#yp_match"><code class="Fn">yp_match</code></a>()</dt>
  <dd>lookup the data corresponding to a given in key in a particular
    map/domain</dd>
  <dt id="yp_first"><a class="permalink" href="#yp_first"><code class="Fn">yp_first</code></a>()</dt>
  <dd>obtain the first key/data pair in a particular map/domain</dd>
  <dt id="yp_next"><a class="permalink" href="#yp_next"><code class="Fn">yp_next</code></a>()</dt>
  <dd>pass <a class="Xr" href="../8/ypserv">ypserv(8)</a> a key in a particular
      map/domain and have it return the key/data pair immediately following it
      (the functions <code class="Fn">yp_first</code>() and
      <code class="Fn">yp_next</code>() can be used to do a sequential search of
      an NIS map)</dd>
  <dt id="yp_all"><a class="permalink" href="#yp_all"><code class="Fn">yp_all</code></a>()</dt>
  <dd>retrieve the entire contents of a map</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">There are a few other requests which
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/ypserv">ypserv(8)</a> is capable of handling (i.e.,
    acknowledge whether or not you can handle a particular domain
    (<code class="Dv">YPPROC_DOMAIN</code>), or acknowledge only if you can
    handle the domain and be silent otherwise
    (<code class="Dv">YPPROC_DOMAIN_NONACK</code>)) but these requests are
    usually generated only by <a class="Xr" href="../8/ypbind">ypbind(8)</a> and
    are not meant to be used by standard utilities.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="HISTORY"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">YP</code> subsystem was written from the
    ground up by <span class="An">Theo de Raadt</span> to be compatible to Sun's
    implementation. Bug fixes, improvements and NIS server support were later
    added by <span class="An">Bill Paul</span>. The server-side code was
    originally written by <span class="An">Peter Eriksson</span> and
    <span class="An">Tobias Reber</span> and is subject to the GNU Public
    License. No Sun code was referenced.</p>
<p class="Pp">OS X NIS client software is derived from FreeBSD.</p>
