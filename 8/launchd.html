<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">launchd</code> manages processes, both for the
    system as a whole and for individual users.</p>
<p class="Pp">The primary and preferred interface to
    <code class="Nm">launchd</code> is via the
    <a class="Xr" href="../1/launchctl">launchctl(1)</a> tool which (among other
    options) allows the user or administrator to load and unload jobs. Where
    possible, it is preferable for jobs to launch on demand based on criteria
    specified in their respective configuration files.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">launchd</code> also manages XPC services that are
    bundled within applications and frameworks on the system.</p>
<p class="Pp">During boot <code class="Nm">launchd</code> is invoked by the
    kernel to run as the first process on the system and to further bootstrap
    the rest of the system.</p>
<p class="Pp">You cannot invoke <code class="Nm">launchd</code> directly.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">On Darwin operating systems, the canonical way to launch a daemon
    is through <code class="Nm">launchd</code> as opposed to traditional POSIX
    and POSIX-like mechanisms or mechanisms provided in earlier versions of OS
    X. These alternate methods should be considered deprecated and not suitable
    for new projects.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the <code class="Nm">launchd</code> lexicon, a daemon is, by
    definition, a system-wide service of which there is one instance for all
    clients. An agent is a service that runs on a per-user basis. Daemons should
    not attempt to display UI or interact directly with a user's login session.
    Any and all work that involves interacting with a user should be done
    through agents.</p>
<p class="Pp">XPC services which are marked with a ServiceType of System are
    functionally equivalent to daemons and run in the same environment, sharing
    the same Mach bootstrap namespace. XPC services which are marked with a
    ServiceType of User are equivalent to agents with the LimitLoadToSessionType
    key specifying the Background session and run in the same environment,
    sharing the same Mach bootstrap namespace. See
    <a class="Xr" href="../5/launchd.plist">launchd.plist(5)</a> for more
    information about user sessions.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Darwin platforms, a user environment includes a specific Mach
    bootstrap subset, audit session and other characteristics not recognized by
    POSIX. Therefore, making the appropriate
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/setuid">setuid(2)</a> and
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/setgid">setgid(2)</a> system calls is not
    sufficient to completely assume the identity for a given user. Running a
    service as a <code class="Nm">launchd</code> agent or a per-user XPC service
    is the only way to run a process with a complete identity of that user.</p>
