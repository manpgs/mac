<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">mount_udf</code> command attaches the UDF
    filesystem residing on the device <span class="Pa">devicePath</span> to the
    global filesystem namespace at the location indicated by
    <span class="Pa">mountPath</span>. This command is normally executed by
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/mount">mount(8)</a> at boot time.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="o"><a class="permalink" href="#o"><code class="Fl">-o</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">options</var></dt>
  <dd>Options are specified with a <code class="Fl">-o</code> flag followed by a
      comma separated string of options. See the
      <a class="Xr" href="../8/mount">mount(8)</a> man page for possible options
      and their meanings.</dd>
  <dt id="v"><a class="permalink" href="#v"><code class="Fl">-v</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">verificationPolicy</var></dt>
  <dd>This is an advanced option not useful for regular use. It controlls the
      verification policy when writing to RW type optical media. Its value can
      be &quot;meta&quot;, &quot;all&quot;, or &quot;none&quot;. Policy
      &quot;meta&quot; means only the metadata are verified after they are
      written. This is the default policy. Policy &quot;all&quot; means to
      verify data written, which could be several times slower than policy
      &quot;meta&quot;. Policy &quot;none&quot; does not verify any data. It is
      only slightly faster than &quot;meta&quot; in normal cases, but may result
      a corrupted UDF disc if the write of metadata fails.</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><code class="Fl">-s</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">sessionStart</var></dt>
  <dd>This is an advanced option not useful for regular use. When manually
      mounting a UDF volume with Virtual Partition, it specifies the start
      Logical Block Address of the last session where UDF data structures (VRS
      and AVDP) resides. This value overrides the value obtained from the
      device.</dd>
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><code class="Fl">-n</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">lastRecordedLBA</var></dt>
  <dd>This is an advanced option not useful for regular use. When manually
      mounting a UDF volume with Virtual Partition, it specifies the last
      recorded Logical Block Address where the UDF VAT ICB will be searched.
      This value overrides the value obtained from the device.</dd>
  <dt id="b"><a class="permalink" href="#b"><code class="Fl">-b</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">blockSize</var></dt>
  <dd>This is an advanced option not useful for regular use. It specifies the
      block size in bytes used when mounting the UDF volume. This value
      overrides the value obtained from the device.</dd>
  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><code class="Fl">-p</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">packetSizeInBlocks</var></dt>
  <dd>This is an advanced option not useful for regular use. It specifies the
      packet size in blocks when manually mounting the UDF volume. This value
      overrides the value obtained from the device.</dd>
  <dt id="w"><a class="permalink" href="#w"><code class="Fl">-w</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This is an advanced option not useful for regular use. It forces to enable
      the experimental packet writing function on optical media that has not
      been fully supported, such as CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD+R, HD DVD-R, and
      BD-R. Writing to these media does not work on some drives and may cause
      data corruption or data loss on some other drives. Therefore, this flag
      should be used only by file system developers when debugging the
      experimental write functions.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fl">-s</code>, <code class="Fl">-n</code>,
    <code class="Fl">-b</code>, and <code class="Fl">-p</code> flags are not
    useful in normal use. They are mainly used for debugging and data recovery.
    Since the <code class="Fl">-s</code>, <code class="Fl">-n</code>, and
    <code class="Fl">-p</code> flags are all specified in units of block size,
    when any of these flags are specified, it is strongly recommended that the
    <code class="Fl">-b</code> flag is also specified.</p>

<p class="Pp">Reading of all UDF revisions (1.02 - 2.60) on both block device
    (e.g., hard drives and USB drives) and most optical media is supported.
    Writing to block devices, DVD-RW and DVD+RW is supported with the following
    exceptions: (1) Cannot write Finder Info, Resource Fork, or other extended
    attributes in UDF volumes of revision 1.02 and 1.50; (2) Cannot write to
