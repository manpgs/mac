<p class="Pp"><b>sudo</b> allows a permitted user to execute a <i>command</i> as
    the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy. The
    invoking user's real (<i>not</i> effective) user-ID is used to determine the
    user name with which to query the security policy.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>sudo</b> supports a plugin architecture for security policies,
    auditing, and input/output logging. Third parties can develop and distribute
    their own plugins to work seamlessly with the <b>sudo</b> front-end. The
    default security policy is <i>sudoers</i>, which is configured via the file
    <i>/private/etc/sudoers</i>, or via LDAP. See the <i>Plugins</i> section for
    more information.</p>
<p class="Pp">The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has
    to run <b>sudo</b>. The policy may require that users authenticate
    themselves with a password or another authentication mechanism. If
    authentication is required, <b>sudo</b> will exit if the user's password is
    not entered within a configurable time limit. This limit is policy-specific;
    the default password prompt timeout for the <i>sudoers</i> security policy
    is 0 minutes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Security policies may support credential caching to allow the user
    to run <b>sudo</b> again for a period of time without requiring
    authentication. By default, the <i>sudoers</i> policy caches credentials on
    a per-terminal basis for 5 minutes. See the <i>timestamp_type</i> and
    <i>timestamp_timeout</i> options in sudoers(5) for more information. By
    running <b>sudo</b> with the <b>-v</b> option, a user can update the cached
    credentials without running a <i>command</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems where <b>sudo</b> is the primary method of gaining
    superuser privileges, it is imperative to avoid syntax errors in the
    security policy configuration files. For the default security policy,
    sudoers(5), changes to the configuration files should be made using the
    visudo(8) utility which will ensure that no syntax errors are
  introduced.</p>
<p class="Pp">When invoked as <b>sudoedit</b>, the <b>-e</b> option (described
    below), is implied.</p>
<p class="Pp">Security policies and audit plugins may log successful and failed
    attempts to run <b>sudo</b>. If an I/O plugin is configured, the running
    <i>command</i>'s input and output may be logged as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="A"><a class="permalink" href="#A"><b>-A</b>, <b>--askpass</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Normally, if <b>sudo</b> requires a password, it will read it from the
      user's terminal. If the <b>-A</b> (<i>askpass</i>) option is specified, a
      (possibly graphical) helper program is executed to read the user's
      password and output the password to the standard output. If the
      SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable is set, it specifies the path to the
      helper program. Otherwise, if sudo.conf(5) contains a line specifying the
      askpass program, that value will be used. For example:
    <pre>
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre># Path to askpass helper program
Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If no askpass program is available, <b>sudo</b> will exit with an
    error.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="a"><a class="permalink" href="#a"><b>-a</b> <i>type</i>,
    <b>--auth-type</b>=<i>type</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Use the specified BSD authentication <i>type</i> when validating the user,
      if allowed by <i>/etc/login.conf</i>. The system administrator may specify
      a list of sudo-specific authentication methods by adding an
      &#x201C;auth-sudo&#x201D; entry in <i>/etc/login.conf</i>. This option is
      only available on systems that support BSD authentication.</dd>
  <dt id="B"><a class="permalink" href="#B"><b>-B</b>, <b>--bell</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Ring the bell as part of the password prompt when a terminal is present.
      This option has no effect if an askpass program is used.</dd>
  <dt id="b"><a class="permalink" href="#b"><b>-b</b>,
    <b>--background</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Run the given <i>command</i> in the background. It is not possible to use
      shell job control to manipulate background processes started by
      <b>sudo</b>. Most interactive <i>command</i>s will fail to work properly
      in background mode.</dd>
  <dt id="C"><a class="permalink" href="#C"><b>-C</b> <i>num</i>,
    <b>--close-from</b>=<i>num</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Close all file descriptors greater than or equal to <i>num</i> before
      executing a <i>command</i>. Values less than three are not permitted. By
      default, <b>sudo</b> will close all open file descriptors other than
      standard input, standard output, and standard error when executing a
      <i>command</i>. The security policy may restrict the user's ability to use
      this option. The <i>sudoers</i> policy only permits use of the <b>-C</b>
      option when the administrator has enabled the <i>closefrom_override</i>
      option.</dd>
  <dt id="c"><a class="permalink" href="#c"><b>-c</b> <i>class</i>,
    <b>--login-class</b>=<i>class</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Run the <i>command</i> with resource limits and scheduling priority of the
      specified login <i>class</i>. The <i>class</i> argument can be either a
      class name as defined in <i>/etc/login.conf</i>, or a single
      &#x2018;-&#x2019; character. If <i>class</i> is <b>-</b>, the default
      login class of the target user will be used. Otherwise, the <i>command</i>
      must be run as the superuser (user-ID 0), or <b>sudo</b> must be run from
      a shell that is already running as the superuser. If the <i>command</i> is
      being run as a login shell, additional <i>/etc/login.conf</i> settings,
      such as the umask and environment variables, will be applied, if present.
      This option is only available on systems with BSD login classes.</dd>
  <dt id="D"><a class="permalink" href="#D"><b>-D</b> <i>directory</i>,
    <b>--chdir</b>=<i>directory</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Run the <i>command</i> in the specified <i>directory</i> instead of the
      current working directory. The security policy may return an error if the
      user does not have permission to specify the working directory.</dd>
  <dt id="E"><a class="permalink" href="#E"><b>-E</b>,
    <b>--preserve-env</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to preserve their
      existing environment variables. The security policy may return an error if
      the user does not have permission to preserve the environment.</dd>
  <dt id="preserve_env=list"><a class="permalink" href="#preserve_env=list"><b>--preserve-env=list</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to add the
      comma-separated list of environment variables to those preserved from the
      user's environment. The security policy may return an error if the user
      does not have permission to preserve the environment. This option may be
      specified multiple times.</dd>
  <dt id="e"><a class="permalink" href="#e"><b>-e</b>, <b>--edit</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Edit one or more <i>file</i>s instead of running a <i>command</i>. In lieu
      of a path name, the string &quot;sudoedit&quot; is used when consulting
      the security policy. If the user is authorized by the policy, the
      following steps are taken:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited with the owner set to
      the invoking user.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>The editor specified by the policy is run to edit the temporary files. The
      <i>sudoers</i> policy uses the SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR environment
      variables (in that order). If none of SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or EDITOR are
      set, the first program listed in the <i>editor</i> sudoers(5) option is
      used.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>If they have been modified, the temporary files are copied back to their
      original location and the temporary versions are removed.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">To help prevent the editing of unauthorized files, the following
    restrictions are enforced unless explicitly allowed by the security
  policy:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>&#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>Symbolic links may not be edited (version 1.8.15 and higher).</dd>
  <dt><b>&#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>Symbolic links along the path to be edited are not followed when the
      parent directory is writable by the invoking user unless that user is root
      (version 1.8.16 and higher).</dd>
  <dt><b>&#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>Files located in a directory that is writable by the invoking user may not
      be edited unless that user is root (version 1.8.16 and higher).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Users are never allowed to edit device special files.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the specified file does not exist, it will be created. Unlike
    most <i>command</i>s run by <i>sudo</i>, the editor is run with the invoking
    user's environment unmodified. If the temporary file becomes empty after
    editing, the user will be prompted before it is installed. If, for some
    reason, <b>sudo</b> is unable to update a file with its edited version, the
    user will receive a warning and the edited copy will remain in a temporary
    file.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="g"><a class="permalink" href="#g"><b>-g</b> <i>group</i>,
    <b>--group</b>=<i>group</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Run the <i>command</i> with the primary group set to <i>group</i> instead
      of the primary group specified by the target user's password database
      entry. The <i>group</i> may be either a group name or a numeric group-ID
      (GID) prefixed with the &#x2018;#&#x2019; character (e.g.,
      &#x2018;#0&#x2019; for GID 0). When running a <i>command</i> as a GID,
      many shells require that the &#x2018;#&#x2019; be escaped with a backslash
      (&#x2018;\&#x2019;). If no <b>-u</b> option is specified, the
      <i>command</i> will be run as the invoking user. In either case, the
      primary group will be set to <i>group</i>. The <i>sudoers</i> policy
      permits any of the target user's groups to be specified via the <b>-g</b>
      option as long as the <b>-P</b> option is not in use.</dd>
  <dt id="H"><a class="permalink" href="#H"><b>-H</b>,
    <b>--set-home</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Request that the security policy set the HOME environment variable to the
      home directory specified by the target user's password database entry.
      Depending on the policy, this may be the default behavior.</dd>
  <dt id="h"><a class="permalink" href="#h"><b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.</dd>
  <dt id="h~2"><a class="permalink" href="#h~2"><b>-h</b> <i>host</i>,
    <b>--host</b>=<i>host</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Run the <i>command</i> on the specified <i>host</i> if the security policy
      plugin supports remote <i>command</i>s. The <i>sudoers</i> plugin does not
      currently support running remote <i>command</i>s. This may also be used in
      conjunction with the <b>-l</b> option to list a user's privileges for the
      remote host.</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><b>-i</b>, <b>--login</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Run the shell specified by the target user's password database entry as a
      login shell. This means that login-specific resource files such as
      <i>.profile</i>, <i>.bash_profile</i>, or <i>.login</i> will be read by
      the shell. If a <i>command</i> is specified, it is passed to the shell as
      a simple <i>command</i> using the <b>-c</b> option. The <i>command</i> and
      any <i>arg</i>s are concatenated, separated by spaces, after escaping each
      character (including white space) with a backslash (&#x2018;\&#x2019;)
      except for alphanumerics, underscores, hyphens, and dollar signs. If no
      <i>command</i> is specified, an interactive shell is executed. <b>sudo</b>
      attempts to change to that user's home directory before running the shell.
      The <i>command</i> is run with an environment similar to the one a user
      would receive at log in. Most shells behave differently when a
      <i>command</i> is specified as compared to an interactive session; consult
      the shell's manual for details. The <i>Command environment</i> section in
      the sudoers(5) manual documents how the <b>-i</b> option affects the
      environment in which a <i>command</i> is run when the <i>sudoers</i>
      policy is in use.</dd>
  <dt id="K"><a class="permalink" href="#K"><b>-K</b>,
    <b>--remove-timestamp</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Similar to the <b>-k</b> option, except that it removes every cached
      credential for the user, regardless of the terminal or parent process ID.
      The next time <b>sudo</b> is run, a password must be entered if the
      security policy requires authentication. It is not possible to use the
      <b>-K</b> option in conjunction with a <i>command</i> or other option.
      This option does not require a password. Not all security policies support
      credential caching.</dd>
  <dt id="k"><a class="permalink" href="#k"><b>-k</b>,
    <b>--reset-timestamp</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When used without a <i>command</i>, invalidates the user's cached
      credentials for the current session. The next time <b>sudo</b> is run in
      the session, a password must be entered if the security policy requires
      authentication. By default, the <b>sudoers</b> policy uses a separate
      record in the credential cache for each terminal (or parent process ID if
      no terminal is present). This prevents the <b>-k</b> option from
      interfering with <b>sudo</b> commands run in a different terminal session.
      See the <i>timestamp_type</i> option in sudoers(5) for more information.
      This option does not require a password, and was added to allow a user to
      revoke <b>sudo</b> permissions from a <i>.logout</i> file.
    <p class="Pp">When used in conjunction with a <i>command</i> or an option
        that may require a password, this option will cause <b>sudo</b> to
        ignore the user's cached credentials. As a result, <b>sudo</b> will
        prompt for a password (if one is required by the security policy) and
        will not update the user's cached credentials.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Not all security policies support credential caching.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="l"><a class="permalink" href="#l"><b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If no <i>command</i> is specified, list the privileges for the invoking
      user (or the <i>user</i> specified by the <b>-U</b> option) on the current
      host. A longer list format is used if this option is specified multiple
      times and the security policy supports a verbose output format.
    <p class="Pp">If a <i>command</i> is specified and is permitted by the
        security policy, the fully-qualified path to the <i>command</i> is
        displayed along with any <i>arg</i>s. If a <i>command</i> is specified
        but not allowed by the policy, <b>sudo</b> will exit with a status value
        of 1.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="N"><a class="permalink" href="#N"><b>-N</b>,
    <b>--no-update</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not update the user's cached credentials, even if the user successfully
      authenticates. Unlike the <b>-k</b> flag, existing cached credentials are
      used if they are valid. To detect when the user's cached credentials are
      valid (or when no authentication is required), the following can be
    used:</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Process_model"><a class="permalink" href="#Process_model">Process
  model</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There are two distinct ways <b>sudo</b> can run a
  <i>command</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an I/O logging plugin is configured to log terminal I/O, or if
    the security policy explicitly requests it, a new pseudo-terminal
    (&#x201C;pty&#x201D;) is allocated and fork(2) is used to create a second
    <b>sudo</b> process, referred to as the <i>monitor</i>. The <i>monitor</i>
    creates a new terminal session with itself as the leader and the pty as its
    controlling terminal, calls fork(2) again, sets up the execution environment
    as described above, and then uses the execve(2) system call to run the
    <i>command</i> in the child process. The <i>monitor</i> exists to relay job
    control signals between the user's terminal and the pty the <i>command</i>
    is being run in. This makes it possible to suspend and resume the
    <i>command</i> normally. Without the <i>monitor</i>, the <i>command</i>
    would be in what POSIX terms an &#x201C;orphaned process group&#x201D; and
    it would not receive any job control signals from the kernel. When the
    <i>command</i> exits or is terminated by a signal, the <i>monitor</i> passes
    the <i>command</i>'s exit status to the main <b>sudo</b> process and exits.
    After receiving the <i>command</i>'s exit status, the main <b>sudo</b>
    process passes the <i>command</i>'s exit status to the security policy's
    close function, as well as the close function of any configured audit
    plugin, and exits.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no pty is used, <b>sudo</b> calls fork(2), sets up the
    execution environment as described above, and uses the execve(2) system call
    to run the <i>command</i> in the child process. The main <b>sudo</b> process
    waits until the <i>command</i> has completed, then passes the
    <i>command</i>'s exit status to the security policy's close function, as
    well as the close function of any configured audit plugins, and exits. As a
    special case, if the policy plugin does not define a close function,
    <b>sudo</b> will execute the <i>command</i> directly instead of calling
    fork(2) first. The <i>sudoers</i> policy plugin will only define a close
    function when I/O logging is enabled, a pty is required, an SELinux role is
    specified, the <i>command</i> has an associated timeout, or the
    <i>pam_session</i> or <i>pam_setcred</i> options are enabled. Both
    <i>pam_session</i> and <i>pam_setcred</i> are enabled by default on systems
    using PAM.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems that use PAM, the security policy's close function is
    responsible for closing the PAM session. It may also log the
    <i>command</i>'s exit status.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Signal_handling"><a class="permalink" href="#Signal_handling">Signal
  handling</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When the <i>command</i> is run as a child of the <b>sudo</b>
    process, <b>sudo</b> will relay signals it receives to the <i>command</i>.
    The SIGINT and SIGQUIT signals are only relayed when the <i>command</i> is
    being run in a new pty or when the signal was sent by a user process, not
    the kernel. This prevents the <i>command</i> from receiving SIGINT twice
    each time the user enters control-C. Some signals, such as SIGSTOP and
    SIGKILL, cannot be caught and thus will not be relayed to the
    <i>command</i>. As a general rule, SIGTSTP should be used instead of SIGSTOP
    when you wish to suspend a <i>command</i> being run by <b>sudo</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a special case, <b>sudo</b> will not relay signals that were
    sent by the <i>command</i> it is running. This prevents the <i>command</i>
    from accidentally killing itself. On some systems, the reboot(8) utility
    sends SIGTERM to all non-system processes other than itself before rebooting
    the system. This prevents <b>sudo</b> from relaying the SIGTERM signal it
    received back to reboot(8), which might then exit before the system was
    actually rebooted, leaving it in a half-dead state similar to single user
    mode. Note, however, that this check only applies to the <i>command</i> run
    by <b>sudo</b> and not any other processes that the <i>command</i> may
    create. As a result, running a script that calls reboot(8) or shutdown(8)
    via <b>sudo</b> may cause the system to end up in this undefined state
    unless the reboot(8) or shutdown(8) are run using the <b>exec</b>() family
    of functions instead of <b>system</b>() (which interposes a shell between
    the <i>command</i> and the calling process).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Plugins"><a class="permalink" href="#Plugins">Plugins</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Plugins may be specified via <i>Plugin</i> directives in the
    sudo.conf(5) file. They may be loaded as dynamic shared objects (on systems
    that support them), or compiled directly into the <b>sudo</b> binary. If no
    sudo.conf(5) file is present, or if it doesn't contain any <i>Plugin</i>
    lines, <b>sudo</b> will use sudoers(5) for the policy, auditing, and I/O
    logging plugins. See the sudo.conf(5) manual for details of the
    <i>/private/etc/sudo.conf</i> file and the sudo_plugin(5) manual for more
    information about the <b>sudo</b> plugin architecture.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXIT_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#EXIT_VALUE">EXIT
  VALUE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Upon successful execution of a <i>command</i>, the exit status
    from <b>sudo</b> will be the exit status of the program that was executed.
    If the <i>command</i> terminated due to receipt of a signal, <b>sudo</b>
    will send itself the same signal that terminated the <i>command</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-l</b> option was specified without a <i>command</i>,
    <b>sudo</b> will exit with a value of 0 if the user is allowed to run
    <b>sudo</b> and they authenticated successfully (as required by the security
    policy). If a <i>command</i> is specified with the <b>-l</b> option, the
    exit value will only be 0 if the <i>command</i> is permitted by the security
    policy, otherwise it will be 1.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there is an authentication failure, a configuration/permission
    problem, or if the given <i>command</i> cannot be executed, <b>sudo</b>
    exits with a value of 1. In the latter case, the error string is printed to
    the standard error. If <b>sudo</b> cannot stat(2) one or more entries in the
    user's PATH, an error is printed to the standard error. (If the directory
    does not exist or if it is not really a directory, the entry is ignored and
    no error is printed.) This should not happen under normal circumstances. The
    most common reason for stat(2) to return &#x201C;permission denied&#x201D;
    is if you are running an automounter and one of the directories in your PATH
    is on a machine that is currently unreachable.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SECURITY_NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#SECURITY_NOTES">SECURITY
  NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>sudo</b> tries to be safe when executing external
    <i>command</i>s.</p>
<p class="Pp">To prevent command spoofing, <b>sudo</b> checks &quot;.&quot; and
    &quot;&quot; (both denoting current directory) last when searching for a
    <i>command</i> in the user's PATH (if one or both are in the PATH).
    Depending on the security policy, the user's PATH environment variable may
    be modified, replaced, or passed unchanged to the program that <b>sudo</b>
    executes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Users should <i>never</i> be granted <b>sudo</b> privileges to
    execute files that are writable by the user or that reside in a directory
    that is writable by the user. If the user can modify or replace the
    <i>command</i> there is no way to limit what additional <i>command</i>s they
    can run.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, <b>sudo</b> will only log the <i>command</i> it
    explicitly runs. If a user runs a <i>command</i> such as &#x2018;sudo
    su&#x2019; or &#x2018;sudo sh&#x2019;, subsequent <i>command</i>s run from
    that shell are not subject to <b>sudo</b>'s security policy. The same is
    true for <i>command</i>s that offer shell escapes (including most editors).
    If I/O logging is enabled, subsequent <i>command</i>s will have their input
    and/or output logged, but there will not be traditional logs for those
    <i>command</i>s. Because of this, care must be taken when giving users
    access to <i>command</i>s via <b>sudo</b> to verify that the <i>command</i>
    does not inadvertently give the user an effective root shell. For
    information on ways to address this, see the <i>Preventing shell escapes</i>
    section in sudoers(5).</p>
<p class="Pp">To prevent the disclosure of potentially sensitive information,
    <b>sudo</b> disables core dumps by default while it is executing (they are
    re-enabled for the <i>command</i> that is run). This historical practice
    dates from a time when most operating systems allowed set-user-ID processes
    to dump core by default. To aid in debugging <b>sudo</b> crashes, you may
    wish to re-enable core dumps by setting &#x201C;disable_coredump&#x201D; to
    false in the sudo.conf(5) file as follows:</p>

<p class="Pp">There is no easy way to prevent a user from gaining a root shell
    if that user is allowed to run arbitrary <i>commands</i> via <b>sudo</b>.
    Also, many programs (such as editors) allow the user to run <i>command</i>s
    via shell escapes, thus avoiding <b>sudo</b>'s checks. However, on most
    systems it is possible to prevent shell escapes with the sudoers(5) plugin's
    <i>noexec</i> functionality.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is not meaningful to run the &#x2018;cd&#x2019; <i>command</i>
    directly via sudo, e.g.,</p>
<pre>
</pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ sudo cd /usr/local/protected</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<p class="Pp">since when the <i>command</i> exits the parent process (your
    shell) will still be the same. The <b>-D</b> option can be used to run a
    <i>command</i> in a specific <i>directory</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Running shell scripts via <b>sudo</b> can expose the same kernel
    bugs that make set-user-ID shell scripts unsafe on some operating systems
    (if your OS has a /dev/fd/ directory, set-user-ID shell scripts are
    generally safe).</p>
