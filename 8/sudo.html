<p class="Pp"><b>sudo</b> allows a permitted user to execute a <i>command</i> as
    the superuser or another user, as specified by the security policy. The
    invoking user's real (<i>not</i> effective) user-ID is used to determine the
    user name with which to query the security policy.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>sudo</b> supports a plugin architecture for security policies
    and input/output logging. Third parties can develop and distribute their own
    policy and I/O logging plugins to work seamlessly with the <b>sudo</b> front
    end. The default security policy is <i>sudoers</i>, which is configured via
    the file <i>/private/etc/sudoers</i>, or via LDAP. See the <i>Plugins</i>
    section for more information.</p>
<p class="Pp">The security policy determines what privileges, if any, a user has
    to run <b>sudo</b>. The policy may require that users authenticate
    themselves with a password or another authentication mechanism. If
    authentication is required, <b>sudo</b> will exit if the user's password is
    not entered within a configurable time limit. This limit is policy-specific;
    the default password prompt timeout for the <i>sudoers</i> security policy
    is unlimited.</p>
<p class="Pp">Security policies may support credential caching to allow the user
    to run <b>sudo</b> again for a period of time without requiring
    authentication. By default, the <i>sudoers</i> policy caches credentials on
    a per-terminal basis for 5 minutes. See the <i>timestamp_type</i> and
    <i>timestamp_timeout</i> options in sudoers(5) for more information. By
    running <b>sudo</b> with the <b>-v</b> option, a user can update the cached
    credentials without running a <i>command</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems where <b>sudo</b> is the primary method of gaining
    superuser privileges, it is imperative to avoid syntax errors in the
    security policy configuration files. For the default security policy,
    sudoers(5), changes to the configuration files should be made using the
    visudo(8) utility which will ensure that no syntax errors are
  introduced.</p>
<p class="Pp">When invoked as <b>sudoedit</b>, the <b>-e</b> option (described
    below), is implied.</p>
<p class="Pp">Security policies may log successful and failed attempts to use
    <b>sudo</b>. If an I/O plugin is configured, the running command's input and
    output may be logged as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="A"><a class="permalink" href="#A"><b>-A</b>, <b>--askpass</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Normally, if <b>sudo</b> requires a password, it will read it from the
      user's terminal. If the <b>-A</b> (<i>askpass</i>) option is specified, a
      (possibly graphical) helper program is executed to read the user's
      password and output the password to the standard output. If the
      SUDO_ASKPASS environment variable is set, it specifies the path to the
      helper program. Otherwise, if sudo.conf(5) contains a line specifying the
      askpass program, that value will be used. For example:
    <pre>
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre># Path to askpass helper program
Path askpass /usr/X11R6/bin/ssh-askpass</pre>
</div>
<pre></pre>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If no askpass program is available, <b>sudo</b> will exit with an
    error.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="B"><a class="permalink" href="#B"><b>-B</b>, <b>--bell</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Ring the bell as part of the password promp when a terminal is present.
      This option has no effect if an askpass program is used.</dd>
  <dt id="b"><a class="permalink" href="#b"><b>-b</b>,
    <b>--background</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Run the given command in the background. Note that it is not possible to
      use shell job control to manipulate background processes started by
      <b>sudo</b>. Most interactive commands will fail to work properly in
      background mode.</dd>
  <dt id="C"><a class="permalink" href="#C"><b>-C</b> <i>num</i>,
    <b>--close-from</b>=<i>num</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Close all file descriptors greater than or equal to <i>num</i> before
      executing a command. Values less than three are not permitted. By default,
      <b>sudo</b> will close all open file descriptors other than standard
      input, standard output and standard error when executing a command. The
      security policy may restrict the user's ability to use this option. The
      <i>sudoers</i> policy only permits use of the <b>-C</b> option when the
      administrator has enabled the <i>closefrom_override</i> option.</dd>
  <dt id="D"><a class="permalink" href="#D"><b>-D</b> <i>directory</i>,
    <b>--chdir</b>=<i>directory</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Run the command in the specified <i>directory</i> instead of the current
      working directory. The security policy may return an error if the user
      does not have permission to specify the working directory.</dd>
  <dt id="E"><a class="permalink" href="#E"><b>-E</b>,
    <b>--preserve-env</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to preserve their
      existing environment variables. The security policy may return an error if
      the user does not have permission to preserve the environment.</dd>
  <dt id="preserve_env=list"><a class="permalink" href="#preserve_env=list"><b>--preserve-env=list</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to add the
      comma-separated list of environment variables to those preserved from the
      user's environment. The security policy may return an error if the user
      does not have permission to preserve the environment. This option may be
      specified multiple times.</dd>
  <dt id="e"><a class="permalink" href="#e"><b>-e</b>, <b>--edit</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Edit one or more files instead of running a command. In lieu of a path
      name, the string &quot;sudoedit&quot; is used when consulting the security
      policy. If the user is authorized by the policy, the following steps are
      taken:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Temporary copies are made of the files to be edited with the owner set to
      the invoking user.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>The editor specified by the policy is run to edit the temporary files. The
      <i>sudoers</i> policy uses the SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL and EDITOR environment
      variables (in that order). If none of SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL or EDITOR are
      set, the first program listed in the <i>editor</i> sudoers(5) option is
      used.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>If they have been modified, the temporary files are copied back to their
      original location and the temporary versions are removed.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">To help prevent the editing of unauthorized files, the following
    restrictions are enforced unless explicitly allowed by the security
  policy:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>&#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>Symbolic links may not be edited (version 1.8.15 and higher).</dd>
  <dt><b>&#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>Symbolic links along the path to be edited are not followed when the
      parent directory is writable by the invoking user unless that user is root
      (version 1.8.16 and higher).</dd>
  <dt><b>&#x2022;</b></dt>
  <dd>Files located in a directory that is writable by the invoking user may not
      be edited unless that user is root (version 1.8.16 and higher).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Users are never allowed to edit device special files.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the specified file does not exist, it will be created. Note
    that unlike most commands run by <i>sudo</i>, the editor is run with the
    invoking user's environment unmodified. If the temporary file becomes empty
    after editing, the user will be prompted before it is installed. If, for
    some reason, <b>sudo</b> is unable to update a file with its edited version,
    the user will receive a warning and the edited copy will remain in a
    temporary file.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="g"><a class="permalink" href="#g"><b>-g</b> <i>group</i>,
    <b>--group</b>=<i>group</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Run the command with the primary group set to <i>group</i> instead of the
      primary group specified by the target user's password database entry. The
      <i>group</i> may be either a group name or a numeric group-ID (GID)
      prefixed with the &#x2018;#&#x2019; character (e.g., #0 for GID 0). When
      running a command as a GID, many shells require that the &#x2018;#&#x2019;
      be escaped with a backslash (&#x2018;\&#x2019;). If no <b>-u</b> option is
      specified, the command will be run as the invoking user. In either case,
      the primary group will be set to <i>group</i>. The <i>sudoers</i> policy
      permits any of the target user's groups to be specified via the <b>-g</b>
      option as long as the <b>-P</b> option is not in use.</dd>
  <dt id="H"><a class="permalink" href="#H"><b>-H</b>,
    <b>--set-home</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Request that the security policy set the HOME environment variable to the
      home directory specified by the target user's password database entry.
      Depending on the policy, this may be the default behavior.</dd>
  <dt id="h"><a class="permalink" href="#h"><b>-h</b>, <b>--help</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Display a short help message to the standard output and exit.</dd>
  <dt id="h~2"><a class="permalink" href="#h~2"><b>-h</b> <i>host</i>,
    <b>--host</b>=<i>host</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Run the command on the specified <i>host</i> if the security policy plugin
      supports remote commands. Note that the <i>sudoers</i> plugin does not
      currently support running remote commands. This may also be used in
      conjunction with the <b>-l</b> option to list a user's privileges for the
      remote host.</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><b>-i</b>, <b>--login</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Run the shell specified by the target user's password database entry as a
      login shell. This means that login-specific resource files such as
      <i>.profile</i>, <i>.bash_profile</i> or <i>.login</i> will be read by the
      shell. If a command is specified, it is passed to the shell for execution
      via the shell's <b>-c</b> option. If no command is specified, an
      interactive shell is executed. <b>sudo</b> attempts to change to that
      user's home directory before running the shell. The command is run with an
      environment similar to the one a user would receive at log in. Note that
      most shells behave differently when a command is specified as compared to
      an interactive session; consult the shell's manual for details. The
      <i>Command environment</i> section in the sudoers(5) manual documents how
      the <b>-i</b> option affects the environment in which a command is run
      when the <i>sudoers</i> policy is in use.</dd>
  <dt id="K"><a class="permalink" href="#K"><b>-K</b>,
    <b>--remove-timestamp</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Similar to the <b>-k</b> option, except that it removes the user's cached
      credentials entirely and may not be used in conjunction with a command or
      other option. This option does not require a password. Not all security
      policies support credential caching.</dd>
  <dt id="k"><a class="permalink" href="#k"><b>-k</b>,
    <b>--reset-timestamp</b></a></dt>
  <dd>When used without a command, invalidates the user's cached credentials. In
      other words, the next time <b>sudo</b> is run a password will be required.
      This option does not require a password and was added to allow a user to
      revoke <b>sudo</b> permissions from a <i>.logout</i> file.
    <p class="Pp">When used in conjunction with a command or an option that may
        require a password, this option will cause <b>sudo</b> to ignore the
        user's cached credentials. As a result, <b>sudo</b> will prompt for a
        password (if one is required by the security policy) and will not update
        the user's cached credentials.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Not all security policies support credential caching.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="l"><a class="permalink" href="#l"><b>-l</b>, <b>--list</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If no <i>command</i> is specified, list the allowed (and forbidden)
      commands for the invoking user (or the user specified by the <b>-U</b>
      option) on the current host. A longer list format is used if this option
      is specified multiple times and the security policy supports a verbose
      output format.
    <p class="Pp">If a <i>command</i> is specified and is permitted by the
        security policy, the fully-qualified path to the command is displayed
        along with any command line arguments. If a <i>command</i> is specified
        but not allowed by the policy, <b>sudo</b> will exit with a status value
        of 1.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><b>-n</b>,
    <b>--non-interactive</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Avoid prompting the user for input of any kind. If a password is required
      for the command to run, <b>sudo</b> will display an error message and
      exit.</dd>
  <dt id="P"><a class="permalink" href="#P"><b>-P</b>,
    <b>--preserve-groups</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Preserve the invoking user's group vector unaltered. By default, the
      <i>sudoers</i> policy will initialize the group vector to the list of
      groups the target user is a member of. The real and effective group-IDs,
      however, are still set to match the target user.</dd>
  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><b>-p</b> <i>prompt</i>,
    <b>--prompt</b>=<i>prompt</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Use a custom password prompt with optional escape sequences. The following

</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="R"><a class="permalink" href="#R"><b>-R</b> <i>directory</i>,

      does not have permission to specify the root directory.</dd>
  <dt id="S"><a class="permalink" href="#S"><b>-S</b>, <b>--stdin</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Write the prompt to the standard error and read the password from the
      standard input instead of using the terminal device.</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><b>-s</b>, <b>--shell</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Run the shell specified by the SHELL environment variable if it is set or
      the shell specified by the invoking user's password database entry. If a
      command is specified, it is passed to the shell for execution via the
      shell's <b>-c</b> option. If no command is specified, an interactive shell
      is executed. Note that most shells behave differently when a command is
      specified as compared to an interactive session; consult the shell's
      manual for details.</dd>
  <dt id="U"><a class="permalink" href="#U"><b>-U</b> <i>user</i>,
    <b>--other-user</b>=<i>user</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Used in conjunction with the <b>-l</b> option to list the privileges for
      <i>user</i> instead of for the invoking user. The security policy may
      restrict listing other users' privileges. The <i>sudoers</i> policy only
      allows root or a user with the ALL privilege on the current host to use
      this option.</dd>
  <dt id="T"><a class="permalink" href="#T"><b>-T</b> <i>timeout</i>,
    <b>--command-timeout</b>=<i>timeout</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Used to set a timeout for the command. If the timeout expires before the
      command has exited, the command will be terminated. The security policy
      may restrict the ability to set command timeouts. The <i>sudoers</i>
      policy requires that user-specified timeouts be explicitly enabled.</dd>
  <dt id="u"><a class="permalink" href="#u"><b>-u</b> <i>user</i>,
    <b>--user</b>=<i>user</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Run the command as a user other than the default target user (usually
      <i>root</i>). The <i>user</i> may be either a user name or a numeric
      user-ID (UID) prefixed with the &#x2018;#&#x2019; character (e.g., #0 for
      UID 0). When running commands as a UID, many shells require that the
      &#x2018;#&#x2019; be escaped with a backslash (&#x2018;\&#x2019;). Some
      security policies may restrict UIDs to those listed in the password
      database. The <i>sudoers</i> policy allows UIDs that are not in the
      password database as long as the <i>targetpw</i> option is not set. Other
      security policies may not support this.</dd>
  <dt id="V"><a class="permalink" href="#V"><b>-V</b>, <b>--version</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print the <b>sudo</b> version string as well as the version string of the
      security policy plugin and any I/O plugins. If the invoking user is
      already root the <b>-V</b> option will display the arguments passed to
      configure when <b>sudo</b> was built and plugins may display more verbose
      information such as default options.</dd>
  <dt id="v"><a class="permalink" href="#v"><b>-v</b>,
    <b>--validate</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Update the user's cached credentials, authenticating the user if
      necessary. For the <i>sudoers</i> plugin, this extends the <b>sudo</b>
      timeout for another 5 minutes by default, but does not run a command. Not
      all security policies support cached credentials.</dd>
  <dt><b>--</b></dt>
  <dd>The <b>--</b> option indicates that <b>sudo</b> should stop processing
      command line arguments.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Options that take a value may only be specified once unless
    otherwise indicated in the description. This is to help guard against
    problems caused by poorly written scripts that invoke <b>sudo</b> with
    user-controlled input.</p>
<p class="Pp">Environment variables to be set for the command may also be passed
    on the command line in the form of <i>VAR</i>=<i>value</i>, e.g.,
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<i>/usr/local/pkg/lib</i>. Variables passed on the command
    line are subject to restrictions imposed by the security policy plugin. The
    <i>sudoers</i> policy subjects variables passed on the command line to the
    same restrictions as normal environment variables with one important
    exception. If the <i>setenv</i> option is set in <i>sudoers</i>, the command
    to be run has the SETENV tag set or the command matched is ALL, the user may
    set variables that would otherwise be forbidden. See sudoers(5) for more

  model</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There are two distinct ways <b>sudo</b> can run a command.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an I/O logging plugin is configured or if the security policy
    explicitly requests it, a new pseudo-terminal (&#x201C;pty&#x201D;) is
    allocated and fork(2) is used to create a second <b>sudo</b> process,
    referred to as the <i>monitor</i>. The <i>monitor</i> creates a new terminal
    session with itself as the leader and the pty as its controlling terminal,
    calls fork(2), sets up the execution environment as described above, and
    then uses the execve(2) system call to run the command in the child process.
    The <i>monitor</i> exists to relay job control signals between the user's
    existing terminal and the pty the command is being run in. This makes it
    possible to suspend and resume the command. Without the monitor, the command
    would be in what POSIX terms an &#x201C;orphaned process group&#x201D; and
    it would not receive any job control signals from the kernel. When the
    command exits or is terminated by a signal, the <i>monitor</i> passes the
    command's exit status to the main <b>sudo</b> process and exits. After
    receiving the command's exit status, the main <b>sudo</b> passes the
    command's exit status to the security policy's close function and exits.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no pty is used, <b>sudo</b> calls fork(2), sets up the
    execution environment as described above, and uses the execve(2) system call
    to run the command in the child process. The main <b>sudo</b> process waits
    until the command has completed, then passes the command's exit status to
    the security policy's close function and exits. As a special case, if the
    policy plugin does not define a close function, <b>sudo</b> will execute the
    command directly instead of calling fork(2) first. The <i>sudoers</i> policy
    plugin will only define a close function when I/O logging is enabled, a pty
    is required, or the <i>pam_session</i> or <i>pam_setcred</i> options are
    enabled. Note that <i>pam_session</i> and <i>pam_setcred</i> are enabled by
    default on systems using PAM.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems that use PAM, the security policy's close function is
    responsible for closing the PAM session. It may also log the command's exit
    status.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Signal_handling"><a class="permalink" href="#Signal_handling">Signal
  handling</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When the command is run as a child of the <b>sudo</b> process,
    <b>sudo</b> will relay signals it receives to the command. The SIGINT and
    SIGQUIT signals are only relayed when the command is being run in a new pty
    or when the signal was sent by a user process, not the kernel. This prevents
    the command from receiving SIGINT twice each time the user enters control-C.
    Some signals, such as SIGSTOP and SIGKILL, cannot be caught and thus will
    not be relayed to the command. As a general rule, SIGTSTP should be used
    instead of SIGSTOP when you wish to suspend a command being run by
    <b>sudo</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a special case, <b>sudo</b> will not relay signals that were
    sent by the command it is running. This prevents the command from
    accidentally killing itself. On some systems, the reboot(8) command sends
    SIGTERM to all non-system processes other than itself before rebooting the
    system. This prevents <b>sudo</b> from relaying the SIGTERM signal it
    received back to reboot(8), which might then exit before the system was
    actually rebooted, leaving it in a half-dead state similar to single user
    mode. Note, however, that this check only applies to the command run by
    <b>sudo</b> and not any other processes that the command may create. As a
    result, running a script that calls reboot(8) or shutdown(8) via <b>sudo</b>
    may cause the system to end up in this undefined state unless the reboot(8)
    or shutdown(8) are run using the <b>exec</b>() family of functions instead
    of <b>system</b>() (which interposes a shell between the command and the
    calling process).</p>
<p class="Pp">If no I/O logging plugins are loaded and the policy plugin has not
    defined a <b>close</b>() function, set a command timeout or required that
    the command be run in a new pty, <b>sudo</b> may execute the command
    directly instead of running it as a child process.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Plugins"><a class="permalink" href="#Plugins">Plugins</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Plugins may be specified via Plugin directives in the sudo.conf(5)
    file. They may be loaded as dynamic shared objects (on systems that support
    them), or compiled directly into the <b>sudo</b> binary. If no sudo.conf(5)
    file is present, or if it doesn't contain any Plugin lines, <b>sudo</b> will
    use sudoers(5) for the policy, auditing and I/O logging plugins. See the
    sudo.conf(5) manual for details of the <i>/private/etc/sudo.conf</i> file
    and the sudo_plugin(5) manual for more information about the <b>sudo</b>
    plugin architecture.</p>

</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXIT_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#EXIT_VALUE">EXIT
  VALUE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Upon successful execution of a command, the exit status from
    <b>sudo</b> will be the exit status of the program that was executed. If the
    command terminated due to receipt of a signal, <b>sudo</b> will send itself
    the same signal that terminated the command.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-l</b> option was specified without a command,
    <b>sudo</b> will exit with a value of 0 if the user is allowed to run
    <b>sudo</b> and they authenticated successfully (as required by the security
    policy). If a command is specified with the <b>-l</b> option, the exit value
    will only be 0 if the command is permitted by the security policy, otherwise
    it will be 1.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there is an authentication failure, a configuration/permission
    problem or if the given command cannot be executed, <b>sudo</b> exits with a
    value of 1. In the latter case, the error string is printed to the standard
    error. If <b>sudo</b> cannot stat(2) one or more entries in the user's PATH,
    an error is printed to the standard error. (If the directory does not exist
    or if it is not really a directory, the entry is ignored and no error is
    printed.) This should not happen under normal circumstances. The most common
    reason for stat(2) to return &#x201C;permission denied&#x201D; is if you are
    running an automounter and one of the directories in your PATH is on a
    machine that is currently unreachable.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SECURITY_NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#SECURITY_NOTES">SECURITY
  NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>sudo</b> tries to be safe when executing external commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">To prevent command spoofing, <b>sudo</b> checks &quot;.&quot; and
    &quot;&quot; (both denoting current directory) last when searching for a
    command in the user's PATH (if one or both are in the PATH). Note, however,
    that the actual PATH environment variable is <i>not</i> modified and is
    passed unchanged to the program that <b>sudo</b> executes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Users should <i>never</i> be granted <b>sudo</b> privileges to
    execute files that are writable by the user or that reside in a directory
    that is writable by the user. If the user can modify or replace the command
    there is no way to limit what additional commands they can run.</p>
<p class="Pp">Please note that <b>sudo</b> will normally only log the command it
    explicitly runs. If a user runs a command such as sudo su or sudo sh,
    subsequent commands run from that shell are not subject to <b>sudo</b>'s
    security policy. The same is true for commands that offer shell escapes
    (including most editors). If I/O logging is enabled, subsequent commands
    will have their input and/or output logged, but there will not be
    traditional logs for those commands. Because of this, care must be taken
    when giving users access to commands via <b>sudo</b> to verify that the
    command does not inadvertently give the user an effective root shell. For
    more information, please see the <i>Preventing shell escapes</i> section in
    sudoers(5).</p>
<p class="Pp">To prevent the disclosure of potentially sensitive information,
    <b>sudo</b> disables core dumps by default while it is executing (they are
    re-enabled for the command that is run). This historical practice dates from
    a time when most operating systems allowed set-user-ID processes to dump
    core by default. To aid in debugging <b>sudo</b> crashes, you may wish to
    re-enable core dumps by setting &#x201C;disable_coredump&#x201D; to false in
    the sudo.conf(5) file as follows:</p>
<pre>
</pre>
