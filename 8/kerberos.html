<p class="Pp">Kerberos is a network authentication system. Its purpose is to
    securely authenticate users and services in an insecure network
  environment.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="principals">This is done with a Kerberos server acting as a
    trusted third party, keeping a database with secret keys for all users and
    services (collectively called
    <a class="permalink" href="#principals"><i class="Em">principals</i></a>).</p>
<p class="Pp" id="realm">Each principal belongs to exactly one
    <a class="permalink" href="#realm"><i class="Em">realm</i></a>, which is the
    administrative domain in Kerberos. A realm usually corresponds to an
    organisation, and the realm should normally be derived from that
    organisation's domain name. A realm is served by one or more Kerberos
    servers.</p>
<p class="Pp">The authentication process involves exchange of
    &#x2018;tickets&#x2019; and &#x2018;authenticators&#x2019; which together
    prove the principal's identity.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="ticket">When you login to the Kerberos system, either through
    the normal system login or with the
    <a class="Xr" href="../1/kinit">kinit(1)</a> program, you acquire a
    <a class="permalink" href="#ticket"><i class="Em">ticket granting
    ticket</i></a> which allows you to get new tickets for other services, such
    as <code class="Ic">telnet</code> or <code class="Ic">ftp</code>, without
    giving your password.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more information on how Kerberos works, and other general
    Kerberos questions see the Kerberos FAQ at
    <span class="Pa">https://www.cmf.nrl.navy.mil/krb/kerberos-faq.html</span>.</p>

<p class="Pp">The Kerberos authentication system was developed in the late
    1980's as part of the Athena Project at the Massachusetts Institute of
    Technology. Versions one through three never reached outside MIT, but
    version 4 was (and still is) quite popular, especially in the academic
    community, but is also used in commercial products like the AFS
  filesystem.</p>
<p class="Pp">The problems with version 4 are that it has many limitations, the
    code was not too well written (since it had been developed over a long
    time), and it has a number of known security problems. To resolve many of
    these issues work on version five started, and resulted in IETF RFC 1510 in
    1993. IETF RFC 1510 was obsoleted in 2005 with IETF RFC 4120, also known as
    Kerberos clarifications. With the arrival of IETF RFC 4120, the work on
    adding extensibility and internationalization have started (Kerberos
    extensions), and a new RFC will hopefully appear soon.</p>
<p class="Pp">This manual page is part of the <code class="Nm">Heimdal</code>
    Kerberos 5 distribution, which has been in development at the Royal
    Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, since about 1997.</p>
