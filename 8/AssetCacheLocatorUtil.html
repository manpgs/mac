<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> reports information
    related to macOS Content Caches running on the computer or on the local
    network.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some of the information that
    <code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> reports depends on the current
    network configuration, and on the user running it. It might produce
    different results for different users, on different client devices, or on
    different networks. Applications that use content caches might choose ones
    other than the ones <code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> reports
    due to factors beyond its knowledge, such as iCloud affinity.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> reports the
    following information separately for system daemons and for the current
    user:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Availability hint</dt>
  <dd>The system can temporarily save a hint about whether or not there might be
      content caches on the computer or on the local network.
      <code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> prints that saved hint if it
      is available.</dd>
  <dt>Saved content caches</dt>
  <dd>The system can temporarily save information about content caches it has
      previously found on the computer or on the local network.
      <code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> prints that saved
      information if it is available.</dd>
  <dt>Refreshed content caches</dt>
  <dd><code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> forces the system to search
      for content caches on the computer and on the local network and to refresh
      the saved information above. It then prints the results.</dd>
  <dt>Saved and refreshed public IP address ranges</dt>
  <dd>If your network administrator has configured public IP address ranges in
      DNS, which the system uses when looking up content caches,
      <code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> prints saved and refreshed
      information about those ranges.</dd>
  <dt>Saved and refreshed favored server ranges</dt>
  <dd>If your network administrator has configured favored server ranges in DNS,
      which the system uses when looking up content caches,
      <code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> prints saved and refreshed
      information about those ranges.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> then reports the
    reachability status of all of the content caches it found. If the computer
    cannot communicate with a content cache over the local network then it
    cannot request files from that content cache. However, just because the
    computer can &quot;ping&quot; a content cache does not imply that that
    content cache will serve requests sent from this computer.</p>
<p class="Pp">The --json option prints the results in machine-parseable JSON
    format to stdout.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="WARNINGS"><a class="permalink" href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> also reports
    warnings about potential issues it discovers.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Apple cloud service with which content caches register limits
    the number of content caches on a network. This limit can change at any
    time. If a larger number of content caches are available on a network than
    the cloud allows, client devices might not always choose the
    &quot;best&quot; content cache.
    <code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> warns when it detects this
    possibility. The number of content caches available on a network can be
    reduced by changing the settings of some of the content caches, using
    <code class="Ic">System Settings &gt; Sharing &gt; Content Caching &gt;
    press the option key &gt; Advanced Options... &gt; Clients &gt; Cache
    content for:</code>.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="ranks"><code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> warns
    when it detects content caches with different
    <a class="permalink" href="#ranks"><i class="Em">ranks</i></a>. The exact
    value and meaning of each rank is defined by the Apple cloud service with
    which content caches register, and can change at any time, but client
    devices use only the content caches with the lowest-numbered rank available
    to them. A content cache's rank can be changed by adjusting its settings,
    using <code class="Ic">System Settings &gt; Sharing &gt; Content Caching
    &gt; press the option key &gt; Advanced Options... &gt; Clients &gt; Cache
    content for:</code>. A content cache on the same computer as the client
    always has the lowest-numbered rank.</p>
<p class="Pp">Having content caches in different ranks can be intentional or
    accidental, depending on your organization.
    <code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> warns about mixed ranks in
    case it is accidental. An example of an intentional use of mixed ranks is
    when a school has a content cache that caches content for
    <code class="Ic">devices using the same local networks</code> and the
    school's district office has another content cache that caches content for
    <code class="Ic">devices using the same public IP address</code>. Client
    devices in the school use the school's content cache. Client devices in a
    different school in the same district use the district's content cache.</p>
<p class="Pp">Every content cache must have a unique GUID.
    <code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> warns when it finds content
    caches in your organization with duplicate GUIDs. A content cache's GUID can
    be changed by stopping the content cache, running the following command in
    Terminal as an admin user, and then restarting it: <code class="Ic">sudo -u
    _assetcache defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.AssetCache.plist
    ServerGUID = `uuidgen`</code></p>
<p class="Pp">When public IP address ranges are configured but the client
    device's public IP address is not in the configured ranges, this could
    prevent the device from using your organization's content caches.
    <code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> warns about this condition. To
    configure custom public IP address ranges use <code class="Ic">System
    Settings &gt; Sharing &gt; Content Caching &gt; press the option key &gt;
    Advanced Options... &gt; Clients &gt; My local networks:</code> and set DNS
    TXT records appropriately.</p>
<p class="Pp">Your network administrator can designate some content caches as
    &quot;favored.&quot; <code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> warns
    when it finds content caches that are not favored, with the exception of a
    content cache on the same computer as the client. Client devices use only
    favored content caches when any are available.</p>
<p class="Pp">The system can temporarily mark content caches as
    &quot;unhealthy&quot; after attempts to use a content cache fail due to
    either HTTP error responses or network errors. Each client device maintains
    its own health records for each content cache. Client devices use only
    healthy content caches. <code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> warns
    when any of the content caches it finds are unhealthy. Note that when
    <code class="Nm">AssetCacheLocatorUtil</code> refreshes the list of content
    caches, it also resets the health of every content cache it finds to
    &quot;healthy.&quot;</p>
