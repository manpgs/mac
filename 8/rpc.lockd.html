<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">rpc.lockd</code> utility provides monitored
    and unmonitored file and record locking services in an NFS environment. To
    monitor the status of hosts requesting locks, the locking daemon typically
    operates in conjunction with
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/rpc.statd">rpc.statd(8)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">rpc.lockd</code> utility runs whenever its
    services are needed to support either the NFS server (see
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/nfsd">nfsd(8)</a>) or the NFS client (an NFS file
    system on which file locking requests have been made). The daemon will
    remain running until a short time after its services are no longer needed to
    support either the NFS client or NFS server.
    <code class="Nm">rpc.lockd</code> will also make sure that the
    <code class="Cm">statd</code> service (on which it depends) is running.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following is a list of command line options that are
    available. However, since <code class="Nm">rpc.lockd</code> is normally
    started by <a class="Xr" href="../8/launchd">launchd(8)</a>, configuration
    of these options should be controlled using the equivalent settings in the
    NFS configuration file. See
    <a class="Xr" href="../5/nfs.conf">nfs.conf(5)</a> for a list of tunable
    parameters.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="d"><a class="permalink" href="#d"><code class="Fl">-d</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The <code class="Fl">-d</code> option causes debugging information to be
      written to syslog, recording all RPC transactions to the daemon. These
      messages are logged with level <code class="Dv">LOG_DEBUG</code> and
      facility <code class="Dv">LOG_DAEMON</code>. Specifying a
      <var class="Ar">debug_level</var> of 1 results in the generation of one
      log line per protocol operation. Higher debug levels can be specified,
      causing display of operation arguments and internal operations of the
      daemon.</dd>
  <dt id="g"><a class="permalink" href="#g"><code class="Fl">-g</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The <code class="Fl">-g</code> option allows to specify the
      <var class="Ar">grace period</var> (in seconds). During the grace period
      <code class="Nm">rpc.lockd</code> only accepts requests from hosts which
      are reinitialising locks which existed before the server restart. Default
      is 45 seconds.</dd>
  <dt id="x"><a class="permalink" href="#x"><code class="Fl">-x</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The <code class="Fl">-x</code> option tells rpc.lockd how long to cache
      state records for monitored hosts. Setting it to zero will disable the
      cache which will make lock and unlock requests from a single client more
      expensive because of additional interaction with the client's statd. The
      default cache time is 60 seconds.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Error conditions are logged to syslog, irrespective of the debug
    level, using log level <code class="Dv">LOG_ERR</code> and facility
    <code class="Dv">LOG_DAEMON</code>.</p>
