<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">halt</code> and
    <code class="Nm">reboot</code> utilities flush the file system cache to
    disk, send all running processes a <code class="Dv">SIGTERM</code> (and
    subsequently a <code class="Dv">SIGKILL</code>) and, respectively, halt or
    restart the system. The action is logged, including entering a shutdown
    record into the <a class="Xr" href="../5/wtmp">wtmp(5)</a> file.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the system is halted with the halt command, the system is
    powered off.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="l"><a class="permalink" href="#l"><code class="Fl">-l</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The halt or reboot is
      <a class="permalink" href="#not"><i class="Em" id="not">not</i></a>
      recorded in the system log. This option is intended for applications such
      as <a class="Xr" href="../8/shutdown">shutdown(8)</a>, that call
      <code class="Nm">reboot</code> or <code class="Nm">halt</code> and log
      this themselves.</dd>
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><code class="Fl">-n</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The file system cache is not flushed. This option should probably not be
      used.</dd>
  <dt id="q"><a class="permalink" href="#q"><code class="Fl">-q</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The system is halted or restarted quickly and ungracefully, and only the
      flushing of the file system cache is performed (if the
      <code class="Fl">-n</code> option is not specified). This option should
      probably not be used.</dd>
  <dt id="u"><a class="permalink" href="#u"><code class="Fl">-u</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The system is halted up until the point of removing system power, but
      waits before removing power for 5 minutes so that an external UPS
      (uninterruptible power supply) can forcibly remove power. This simulates a
      dirty shutdown to permit a later automatic power on. macOS uses this mode
      automatically with supported UPSs in emergency shutdowns.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Normally, the <a class="Xr" href="../8/shutdown">shutdown(8)</a>
    utility is used when the system needs to be halted or restarted, giving
    users advance warning of their impending doom and cleanly terminating
    specific programs.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SIGTERM_TO_SIGKILL_INTERVAL"><a class="permalink" href="#SIGTERM_TO_SIGKILL_INTERVAL">SIGTERM
  TO SIGKILL INTERVAL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Dv">SIGKILL</code> will follow the
    <code class="Dv">SIGTERM</code> by an intentionally indeterminate period of
    time. Programs are expected to take only enough time to flush all dirty data
    and exit. Developers are encouraged to file a bug with the OS vendor, should
    they encounter an issue with this functionality.</p>
