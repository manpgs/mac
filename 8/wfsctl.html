<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">wfsctl</code> utility allows administrators
    to start, stop, and check the status of the WebDAV File Sharing service
    (WFS). It also allows administrators to create and delete WebDAV share
    points. It operates by configuring the Apache httpd server. The
    <code class="Nm">wfsctl</code> command requires root privileges.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="start"><a class="permalink" href="#start"><code class="Ic">start</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Enable the WFS configuration, and either start or restart the Apache web
      server to pick it up. If necessary, this action will create an SSL
      Identity matching the machine's host name as determined by the hostname(1)
      command, and place it in the System keychain. It will also update, if
      necessary, environment variable definitions for use by parameterized httpd
      config files. (Note that starting the Apache web server is the equivalent
      of &quot;apachectl start&quot; which loads a launch job for the httpd
      process.)</dd>

<p class="Pp">WebDAV File Sharing operates by:</p>
<ol class="Bl-enum">
  <li>Recognizing WebDAV clients when they send OPTIONS or PROPFIND
    directives</li>
  <li>Requiring such clients to provide OD credentials</li>
  <li>Assigning those authenticated users an HTTP cookie to recognize them as
      WebDAV clients</li>
  <li>Launching an instance of the Apache httpd process on behalf of that user,
      configured as a WebDAV server</li>
  <li>Reverse-proxying HTTP traffic to that user-specific instance of httpd, so
      that the WebDAV client (typically an iWork app on iOS) can access the home
      directory and share points on the server machine with privileges of the
      authenticated user</li>
  <li>Recognizing share points that are marked as WebDAV share points.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Pp">Depending on how Apache is configured, this can coexist with other
    Apache web service functions.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>WebDAV File Sharing requires SSL, and uses Basic authentication, with
      credentials that would otherwise be sent in the clear over the network.
      Also note that it uses Apache modules mod_ssl for SSL, and
      mod_authnz_od_apple for Basic authentication with OpenDirectory
      credentials.</li>
  <li>The name &quot;webdav&quot; is reserved (it triggers special handling of
      URLs), so share point paths named &quot;/webdav&quot; or containing
      &quot;webdav&quot; as a subpath are not allowed. And folders named
      &quot;webdav&quot; within share points won't be usable. There are no
      restrictions on case variants such as &quot;WebDAV&quot;, or other
      variants such as &quot;webdav.d&quot;.</li>
  <li>DropBox folders cannot be accessed via WebDAV File Sharing.</li>

  SETTINGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Certain settings are kept in /etc/wfs/wfs.plist and are
    configurable by the administrator, including:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="ServerName"><a class="permalink" href="#ServerName"><code class="Ic">ServerName</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The host name the Apache web server should use, and also the Common Name
      of the identity certificate. If this is not configured, or set to an empty
      string, the hostname(1) of the machine is used.</dd>
  <dt id="ServerAddr"><a class="permalink" href="#ServerAddr"><code class="Ic">ServerAddr</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The IP address the Apache web server should use to listen for HTTPS
      requests. Default is &quot;*&quot;, which means all addresses.</dd>
  <dt id="ServerPort"><a class="permalink" href="#ServerPort"><code class="Ic">ServerPort</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The TCP port the Apache web server should use to listen for HTTPS
      requests. Default is the standard HTTPS port, 443.</dd>
  <dt id="AccessGroup"><a class="permalink" href="#AccessGroup"><code class="Ic">AccessGroup</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The Open Directory group allowed access to the WebDAV File Sharing
      service. The default is &quot;everyone&quot;, which gives access to any
      authenticated user. Administrators can change this setting to restrict
      access further. Authenticated users will have, at most, the privileges
      they are normally allowed by file system permissions. There is no
      provision for guest access, so unauthenticated users have no access.</dd>
  <dt id="SynthesizeSharePointForUserHomeDir"><a class="permalink" href="#SynthesizeSharePointForUserHomeDir"><code class="Ic">SynthesizeSharePointForUserHomeDir</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Whether to allow remote WebDAV clients to see their home directory as a
      share point. Default is True.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The Apache config file for WebDAV File Sharing is parameterized,
    and the httpd server is managed by the httpd-wrapper utility, which passes
    parameters to httpd. This is normally transparent, but note that to check
    the Apache config file syntax, do not use &quot;apachectl configtest&quot;
    or &quot;httpd -t&quot;. Instead, use &quot;httpd-wrapper -t&quot;.</p>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>WebDAV clients must be properly configured to access WebDAV Shares on a
      remote host.</li>
  <li>WebDAV clients include certain iOS apps, like Numbers, Keynote, and Pages,
      and the macOS Finder's Connect-to-Server. (Note that the iOS Files app
      does not find WebDAV File Sharing locations.)</li>
  <li>WebDAV clients must usually be configured with a full URL of the host,
      with a scheme of https (since an http-&gt;https redirect is not generally
      compatible with WebDAV operations). It's not necessary to specify /webdav
      in the path. So for example, the &quot;Server Name&quot; might be
      specified as:
    <pre>
https://hostname.example.com</pre>
  </li>
  <li>The configurable virtual host behavior once provided by macOS Server is
      not available, so WebDAV clients may not be able to use alternate host
      names in their URLs.</li>

<p class="Pp">When macOS Server is installed and promoted, and the Apache
    instance for Profile Manager is enabled, WebDAV File Sharing is reconfigured
    to support the WebDAV behaviors presented by Server:</p>
<ol class="Bl-enum">
  <li>macOS Server provides HTTP-based services (for Profile Manager) on
      standard HTTP/S TCP ports 80 and 443. So to avoid port conflict, the
      desktop Apache configuration (including the configuration for WebDAV File
      Sharing) is switched to port 81, on localhost only, and WFS traffic is
      reverse proxied to localhost:81.</li>
  <li>macOS Server manages its own SSL certificates, and provides the SSL
      endpoint. So the desktop Apache configuration for WebDAV File Sharing is
      switched to non-SSL.
    <p class="Pp">When macOS Server is installed and promoted, and the Apache
        instance for Profile Manager is enabled, it is still possible to use
        wfsctl to manage WebDAV share points, e. g.:</p>
    <pre>
    sudo wfsctl share /Volumes/Data/Share1</pre>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </li>
  <li>Any share points created in the UI on versions of macOS Server that
      predate High Sierra remain across updates, and those that were marked as
      WebDAV share points should continue to be available after the update to
      High Sierra or newer, whether or not macOS Server is installed.</li>
</ol>
<p class="Pp">When the Apache instance for Profile Manager is disabled, or when
    macOS Server is removed or demoted, the port changes and SSL changes
    described above are reversed.</p>
