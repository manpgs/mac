<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">nfsiod</code> is deprecated. See

    info.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">nfsiod</code> controls the maximum number of
    asynchronous I/O threads used for NFS mounts. Historically, it has consisted
    of a daemon that never exits. However, asynchronous I/O requests are now
    serviced by threads launched on demand in the kernel and the
    <code class="Nm">nfsiod</code> command simply sets the configuration
  limit.</p>
<p class="Pp">Having asynchronous I/O threads improves performance but is not
    required for correct operation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><code class="Fl">-n</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Specify maximum number of asynchronous I/O threads to be used.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If no maximum is specified, <code class="Nm">nfsiod</code>
    displays the current value. The default value is 16. A client should allow
    enough threads to handle its maximum level of concurrency.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">nfsiod</code> utility exits 0 on success, and
    &gt;0 if an error occurs.</p>
