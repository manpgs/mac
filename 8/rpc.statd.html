<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">rpc.statd</code> utility is a daemon which
    cooperates with <code class="Nm">rpc.statd</code> daemons on other hosts to
    provide a status monitoring service. The daemon accepts requests from
    programs running on the local host (typically,
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/rpc.lockd">rpc.lockd(8)</a>, the NFS file locking
    daemon) to monitor the status of specified hosts. If a monitored host
    crashes and restarts, the remote daemon will notify the local daemon, which
    in turn will notify the local program(s) which requested the monitoring
    service. Conversely, if this host crashes and restarts, the
    <code class="Cm">statd.notify</code> service will be started to notify all
    of the hosts which were being monitored at the time of the crash.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">rpc.statd</code> utility consists of two
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/launchd">launchd(8)</a>-controlled services. The
    <code class="Cm">statd.notify</code> service is run whenever the system
    needs to notify remote hosts of a restart. The <code class="Cm">statd</code>
    service is controlled by
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/rpc.lockd">rpc.lockd(8)</a> so that the
    <code class="Nm">rpc.statd</code> daemon is running whenever
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/rpc.lockd">rpc.lockd(8)</a> is running.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following is a list of command line options that are
    available. Note that since <code class="Nm">rpc.statd</code> is normally
    started by <a class="Xr" href="../8/launchd">launchd(8)</a>, configuration
    of these options should be controlled using the equivalent settings in the
    NFS configuration file. See
    <a class="Xr" href="../5/nfs.conf">nfs.conf(5)</a> for a list of tunable
    parameters.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="d"><a class="permalink" href="#d"><code class="Fl">-d</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Sets the logging level to the maximum. Note that finer grain control is
      available via the <code class="Cm">nfs.statd.verbose</code> option in
      <a class="Xr" href="../5/nfs.conf">nfs.conf(5)</a>.
    <p class="Pp">Logging is performed via
        <a class="Xr" href="../3/syslog">syslog(3)</a> using the LOG_DAEMON
        facility. By default, only messages up to priority LOG_WARNING are
        logged. Setting the verbose level to one will add LOG_NOTICE messages
        which includes logging failed mount attempts. A verbose level of two
        will increase the log level to LOG_INFO which includes logging
        successful mount attempts. A log level of three or more will add
        LOG_DEBUG messages and cause increasing amounts of debug information to
        be logged. The debug information exposes lots of information about
        <code class="Nm">rpc.statd</code>'s inner workings which is typically
        only useful to developers. Note: the
        <a class="Xr" href="../8/syslog">syslog(8)</a> configuration may need to
        be adjusted in order to see the increased verbosity.</p>

<p class="Pp">The following command line option causes the daemon to run in the
    <code class="Cm">statd.notify</code> notification service mode:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><code class="Fl">-n</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Send SM_NOTIFY messages to notify any hosts of a restart.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The remaining command line options may be useful for viewing or
    modifying the contents of the status file. They do not start up any daemon
    or service.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="l"><a class="permalink" href="#l"><code class="Fl">-l</code></a></dt>
  <dd>List each host (and its status) in the status file.</dd>
  <dt id="L"><a class="permalink" href="#L"><code class="Fl">-L</code></a></dt>
  <dd>List each host (and its status) in the status file and then continue to

  <dt id="N"><a class="permalink" href="#N"><code class="Fl">-N</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Clear the &quot;needs notification&quot; status for
      <var class="Ar">hostname</var> so the <code class="Cm">statd.notify</code>
      service will no longer try to notify it.</dd>

<p class="Pp">There is no means for the daemon to tell when a monitored host has
    disappeared permanently (eg. catastrophic hardware failure), as opposed to
    transient failure of the host or an intermediate router. At present, it will
    pause and re-try notification at frequent intervals for 10 minutes, then
    hourly, and finally gives up after 24 hours. The <code class="Fl">-N</code>
    option may be used to remove the &quot;needs notification&quot; status from
    such hosts.</p>
<p class="Pp">The protocol requires that symmetric monitor requests are made to
    both the local and remote daemon in order to establish a monitored
    relationship. This is convenient for the NFS locking protocol, but probably
    reduces the usefulness of the monitoring system for other applications.</p>
