<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">comsat</code> utility is the server process
    which receives reports of incoming mail and notifies users if they have
    requested this service. The <code class="Nm">comsat</code> utility receives
    messages on a datagram port associated with the &#x201C;biff&#x201D; service
    specification (see <a class="Xr" href="../5/services">services(5)</a> and
    <a class="Xr" href="../8/inetd">inetd(8)</a>). The one line messages are of
    the form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd
  Bd-indent"><var class="Ar">user</var>@<var class="Ar">mailbox</var>-<var class="Ar">offset</var>[:<var class="Ar">mailbox-name</var>]</div>
<p class="Pp">If the <var class="Ar">user</var> specified is logged in to the
    system and the associated terminal has the owner execute bit turned on (by a
    &#x201C;<code class="Nm">biff</code> <code class="Cm">y</code>&#x201D;), the
    <var class="Ar">offset</var> is used as a seek offset into the appropriate
    mailbox file and the first 7 lines or 560 characters of the message are
    printed on the user's terminal. Lines which appear to be part of the message
    header other than the &#x201C;<code class="Li">From</code>&#x201D;,
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">To</code>&#x201D;,
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">Date</code>&#x201D;, or
    &#x201C;<code class="Li">Subject</code>&#x201D; lines are not included in
    the displayed message.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <var class="Ar">user</var> specified is logged in to the
    system and the associated terminal has the group execute bit turned on (by a
    &#x201C;<code class="Nm">biff</code> <code class="Cm">b</code>&#x201D;), two
    bell characters (ASCII \007) are printed on the user's terminal.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <var class="Ar">mailbox-name</var> omitted, standard mailbox
    assumed.</p>

<p class="Pp">The message header filtering is prone to error. The density of the
    information presented is near the theoretical minimum.</p>
<p class="Pp">Users should be notified of mail which arrives on other machines
    than the one to which they are currently logged in.</p>
<p class="Pp">The notification should appear in a separate window so it does not
    mess up the screen.</p>
