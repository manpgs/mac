    causes creation of a new process. The new process (child process) is an
    exact copy of the calling process (parent process) except for the
  following:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet Bd-indent">
  <li>The child process has a unique process ID.</li>
  <li>The child process has a different parent process ID (i.e., the process ID
      of the parent process).</li>
  <li>The child process has its own copy of the parent's descriptors. These
      descriptors reference the same underlying objects, so that, for instance,
      file pointers in file objects are shared between the child and the parent,
      so that an <a class="Xr" href="../2/lseek">lseek(2)</a> on a descriptor in
      the child process can affect a subsequent
      <a class="Xr" href="../1/read">read</a> or
      <a class="Xr" href="../1/write">write</a> by the parent. This descriptor
      copying is also used by the shell to establish standard input and output
      for newly created processes as well as to set up pipes.</li>
  <li>The child processes resource utilizations are set to 0; see
      <a class="Xr" href="../2/setrlimit">setrlimit(2)</a>.</li>

<p class="Pp">There are limits to what you can do in the child process. To be
    totally safe you should restrict yourself to only executing async-signal
    safe operations until such time as one of the exec functions is called. All
    APIs, including global data symbols, in any framework or library should be
    assumed to be unsafe after a <code class="Fn">fork</code>() unless
    explicitly documented to be safe or async-signal safe. If you need to use
    these frameworks in the child process, you must exec. In this situation it
    is reasonable to exec yourself.</p>
