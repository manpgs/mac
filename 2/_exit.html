<p class="Pp">The
    <a class="permalink" href="#_exit"><code class="Fn" id="_exit">_exit</code></a>()
    function terminates a process, with the following consequences:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>All of the descriptors that were open in the calling process are closed.
      This may entail delays; for example, waiting for output to drain. A
      process in this state may not be killed, as it is already dying.</li>
  <li id="status">If the parent process of the calling process has an
      outstanding <a class="Xr" href="../1/wait">wait</a> call or catches the
      <code class="Dv">SIGCHLD</code> signal, it is notified of the calling
      process's termination; the
      <a class="permalink" href="#status"><i class="Em">status</i></a> is set as
      defined by <a class="Xr" href="../2/wait">wait(2)</a>.</li>
  <li>The parent process-ID of all of the calling process's existing child
      processes are set to 1; the initialization process (see the DEFINITIONS
      section of <a class="Xr" href="../2/intro">intro(2)</a>) inherits each of
      these processes.</li>
  <li>If the termination of the process causes any process group to become
      orphaned (usually because the parents of all members of the group have now
      exited; see &#x201C;orphaned process group&#x201D; in
      <a class="Xr" href="../2/intro">intro(2)</a>), and if any member of the
      orphaned group is stopped, the <code class="Dv">SIGHUP</code> signal and
      the <code class="Dv">SIGCONT</code> signal are sent to all members of the
      newly-orphaned process group.</li>
  <li>If the process is a controlling process (see
      <a class="Xr" href="../2/intro">intro(2)</a>), the
      <code class="Dv">SIGHUP</code> signal is sent to the foreground process
      group of the controlling terminal. All current access to the controlling
      terminal is revoked.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp" id="_exit~2">Most C programs call the library routine
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/exit">exit(3)</a>, which flushes buffers, closes
    streams, unlinks temporary files, etc., before calling
