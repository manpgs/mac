<p class="Pp">The
    <a class="permalink" href="#issetugid"><code class="Fn" id="issetugid">issetugid</code></a>()
    system call returns 1 if the process environment or memory address space is
    considered &#x201C;tainted&#x201D;, and returns 0 otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">A process is tainted if it was created as a result of an
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/execve">execve(2)</a> system call which had either
    of the setuid or setgid bits set (and extra privileges were given as a
    result) or if it has changed any of its real, effective or saved user or
    group ID's since it began execution.</p>
<p class="Pp">This system call exists so that library routines (eg: libc,
    libtermcap) can reliably determine if it is safe to use information that was
    obtained from the user, in particular the results from
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/getenv">getenv(3)</a> should be viewed with
    suspicion if it is used to control operation.</p>
<p class="Pp">A &#x201C;tainted&#x201D; status is inherited by child processes
    as a result of the <a class="Xr" href="../2/fork">fork(2)</a> system call
    (or other library code that calls fork, such as
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/popen">popen(3)</a>).</p>
<p class="Pp">It is assumed that a program that clears all privileges as it
    prepares to execute another will also reset the environment, hence the
    &#x201C;tainted&#x201D; status will not be passed on. This is important for
    programs such as <a class="Xr" href="../1/su">su(1)</a> which begin setuid
    but need to be able to create an untainted process.</p>
