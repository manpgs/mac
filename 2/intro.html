<p class="Pp">Nearly all of the system calls provide an error number in the
    external variable <var class="Va">errno</var>, which is defined as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">extern int errno</code></div>
<p class="Pp">When a system call detects an error, it returns an integer value
    indicating failure (usually -1) and sets the variable
    <var class="Va">errno</var> accordingly. &lt;This allows interpretation of
    the failure on receiving a -1 and to take action accordingly.&gt; Successful
    calls never set <var class="Va">errno</var>; once set, it remains until
    another error occurs. It should only be examined after an error. Note that a
    number of system calls overload the meanings of these error numbers, and
    that the meanings must be interpreted according to the type and
    circumstances of the call.</p>

      job control mechanisms of <a class="Xr" href="../1/csh">csh(1)</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Session</dt>
  <dd>A session is a set of one or more process groups. A session is created by

  <dd>A process that has created a new session by a successful call to

  <dd>A terminal may be acquired by a session leader as its controlling

      groups within the session may be placed into the foreground by setting the
      terminal process group ID to the ID of the process group. This facility is
      used to arbitrate between multiple jobs contending for the same terminal;

      group is orphaned when none of its members has a parent process that is in

      that when a process exits, the parent process for its children is changed
      to be <a class="Xr" href="../8/launchd">launchd(8)</a>, which is in a
      separate session. Not all members of an orphaned process group are
      necessarily orphaned processes (those whose creating process has exited).
      The process group of a session leader is orphaned by definition.</dd>
  <dt>Real User ID and Real Group ID</dt>
  <dd>Each user on the system is identified by a positive integer termed the
      real user ID.
    <p class="Pp">Each user is also a member of one or more groups. One of these
        groups is distinguished from others and used in implementing accounting
        facilities. The positive integer corresponding to this distinguished
        group is termed the real group ID.</p>
    <p class="Pp">All processes have a real user ID and real group ID. These are
        initialized from the equivalent attributes of the process that created
        it.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Effective User Id, Effective Group Id, and Group Access List</dt>
  <dd>Access to system resources is governed by two values: the effective user
      ID, and the group access list. The first member of the group access list
      is also known as the effective group ID. (In POSIX.1, the group access
      list is known as the set of supplementary group IDs, and it is unspecified
      whether the effective group ID is a member of the list.)
    <p class="Pp">The effective user ID and effective group ID are initially the
        process's real user ID and real group ID respectively. Either may be
        modified through execution of a set-user-ID or set-group-ID file
        (possibly by one its ancestors) (see
        <a class="Xr" href="../2/execve">execve(2)</a>). By convention, the
        effective group ID (the first member of the group access list) is
        duplicated, so that the execution of a set-group-ID program does not
        result in the loss of the original (real) group ID.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The group access list is a set of group IDs used only in
        determining resource accessibility. Access checks are performed as
        described below in ``File Access Permissions''.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Saved Set User ID and Saved Set Group ID</dt>
  <dd>When a process executes a new file, the effective user ID is set to the

      (first element of the group access list) is set to the group of the file
      if the file is set-group-ID. The effective user ID of the process is then
      recorded as the saved set-user-ID, and the effective group ID of the
      process is recorded as the saved set-group-ID. These values may be used to
      regain those values as the effective user or group ID after reverting to
      the real ID (see <a class="Xr" href="../2/setuid">setuid(2)</a>). (In
      POSIX.1, the saved set-user-ID and saved set-group-ID are optional, and
      are used in setuid and setgid, but this does not work as desired for the
      super-user.)</dd>

      respectively. Dot refers to the directory itself and dot-dot refers to its
      parent directory.</dd>
  <dt>Root Directory and Current Working Directory</dt>
  <dd>Each process has associated with it a concept of a root directory and a
      current working directory for the purpose of resolving path name searches.
      A process's root directory need not be the root directory of the root file
      system.</dd>
  <dt>File Access Permissions</dt>
  <dd>Every file in the file system has a set of access permissions. These
      permissions are used in determining whether a process may perform a
      requested operation on the file (such as opening a file for writing).
      Access permissions are established at the time a file is created. They may
      be changed at some later time through the
      <a class="Xr" href="../2/chmod">chmod(2)</a> call.
    <p class="Pp">File access is broken down according to whether a file may be:
        read, written, or executed. Directory files use the execute permission
        to control if the directory may be searched.</p>
    <p class="Pp">File access permissions are interpreted by the system as they
        apply to three different classes of users: the owner of the file, those
        users in the file's group, anyone else. Every file has an independent
        set of access permissions for each of these classes. When an access
        check is made, the system decides if permission should be granted by
        checking the access information applicable to the caller.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Read, write, and execute/search permissions on a file are
        granted to a process if:</p>
    <p class="Pp">The process's effective user ID is that of the super-user.
        (Note: even the super-user cannot execute a non-executable file.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">The process's effective user ID matches the user ID of the
        owner of the file and the owner permissions allow the access.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The process's effective user ID does not match the user ID of
        the owner of the file, and either the process's effective group ID
        matches the group ID of the file, or the group ID of the file is in the
        process's group access list, and the group permissions allow the
      access.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Neither the effective user ID nor effective group ID and group
        access list of the process match the corresponding user ID and group ID
        of the file, but the permissions for ``other users'' allow access.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Otherwise, permission is denied.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Sockets and Address Families</dt>
  <dd>
    <p class="Pp">A socket is an endpoint for communication between processes.
        Each socket has queues for sending and receiving data.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Sockets are typed according to their communications
        properties. These properties include whether messages sent and received
        at a socket require the name of the partner, whether communication is
        reliable, the format used in naming message recipients, etc.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Each instance of the system supports some collection of socket

        family in which the socket was created.</p>
