<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_next_ex</b>() reads the next packet and returns a
    success/failure indication. If the packet was read without problems, the
    pointer pointed to by the <i>pkt_header</i> argument is set to point to the
    <i>pcap_pkthdr</i> struct for the packet, and the pointer pointed to by the
    <i>pkt_data</i> argument is set to point to the data in the packet. The
    <i>struct pcap_pkthdr</i> and the packet data are not to be freed by the
    caller, and are not guaranteed to be valid after the next call to
    <b>pcap_next_ex</b>(), <b>pcap_next</b>(), <b>pcap_loop</b>(3PCAP), or
    <b>pcap_dispatch</b>(3PCAP); if the code needs them to remain valid, it must
    make a copy of them.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_next</b>() reads the next packet (by calling
    <b>pcap_dispatch</b>() with a <i>cnt</i> of 1) and returns a <i>u_char</i>
    pointer to the data in that packet. The packet data is not to be freed by
    the caller, and is not guaranteed to be valid after the next call to
    <b>pcap_next_ex</b>(), <b>pcap_next</b>(), <b>pcap_loop</b>(), or
    <b>pcap_dispatch</b>(); if the code needs it to remain valid, it must make a
    copy of it. The <i>pcap_pkthdr</i> structure pointed to by <i>h</i> is
    filled in with the appropriate values for the packet.</p>
<p class="Pp">The bytes of data from the packet begin with a link-layer header.
    The format of the link-layer header is indicated by the return value of the
    <b>pcap_datalink</b>(3PCAP) routine when handed the <b>pcap_t</b> value also
    passed to <b>pcap_loop</b>() or <b>pcap_dispatch</b>().
    <i>https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html</i> lists the values
    <b>pcap_datalink</b>() can return and describes the packet formats that
    correspond to those values. The value it returns will be valid for all
    packets received unless and until <b>pcap_set_datalink</b>(3PCAP) is called;
    after a successful call to <b>pcap_set_datalink</b>(), all subsequent
    packets will have a link-layer header of the type specified by the
    link-layer header type value passed to <b>pcap_set_datalink</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp">Do <b>NOT</b> assume that the packets for a given capture or
    ``savefile`` will have any given link-layer header type, such as
    <b>DLT_EN10MB</b> for Ethernet. For example, the &quot;any&quot; device on
    Linux will have a link-layer header type of <b>DLT_LINUX_SLL</b> or
    <b>DLT_LINUX_SLL2</b> even if all devices on the system at the time the
    &quot;any&quot; device is opened have some other data link type, such as
    <b>DLT_EN10MB</b> for Ethernet.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN
  VALUE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_next_ex</b>() returns <b>1</b> if the packet was read
    without problems, <b>0</b> if packets are being read from a live capture and
    the packet buffer timeout expired, <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> if an error occurred
    while reading the packet, and <b>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK</b> if packets are being
    read from a ``savefile'' and there are no more packets to read from the
    savefile. If <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> is returned, <b>pcap_geterr</b>(3PCAP) or
    <b>pcap_perror</b>(3PCAP) may be called with <i>p</i> as an argument to
    fetch or display the error text.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_next</b>() returns a pointer to the packet data on
    success, and returns <b>NULL</b> if an error occurred, or if no packets were
    read from a live capture (if, for example, they were discarded because they
    didn't pass the packet filter, or if, on platforms that support a packet
    buffer timeout that starts before any packets arrive, the timeout expires
    before any packets arrive, or if the file descriptor for the capture device
    is in non-blocking mode and no packets were available to be read), or if no
    more packets are available in a ``savefile.'' Unfortunately, there is no way
    to determine whether an error occurred or not.</p>
