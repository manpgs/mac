<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_set_immediate_mode</b>() sets whether immediate mode
    should be set on a capture handle when the handle is activated. In immediate
    mode, packets are always delivered as soon as they arrive, with no
    buffering. If <i>immediate_mode</i> is non-zero, immediate mode will be set,
    otherwise it will not be set.</p>

  <dd>on FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly BSD, macOS, and Solaris 11,
      immediate mode must be turned on with a <b>BIOCIMMEDIATE</b>
      <b>ioctl</b>(2), as documented in <b>bpf</b>(@MAN_DEVICES@), on the
      descriptor returned by <b>pcap_fileno</b>(3PCAP), after
      <b>pcap_activate</b>(3PCAP) is called;</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>on Solaris 10 and earlier versions of Solaris, immediate mode must be
      turned on by using a read timeout of 0 when opening the device (this will
      not provide immediate delivery of packets on other platforms, so don't
      assume it's sufficient);</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>on Digital UNIX/Tru64 UNIX, immediate mode must be turned on by doing a
      <b>BIOCMBIC</b> <b>ioctl</b>, as documented in <b>packetfilter</b>(7), to
      clear the <b>ENBATCH</b> flag on the descriptor returned by
      <b>pcap_fileno</b>(3PCAP), after <b>pcap_activate</b>(3PCAP) is
    called;</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>on Windows, immediate mode must be turned on by calling
      <b>pcap_setmintocopy</b>() with a size of 0.</dd>

<p class="Pp">On Linux, with previous releases of libpcap, capture devices are
    always in immediate mode; however, in 1.5.0 and later, they are, by default,
    <b>not</b> in immediate mode, so if <b>pcap_set_immediate_mode</b>() is
    available, it should be used.</p>
