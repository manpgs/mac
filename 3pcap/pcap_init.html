<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_init</b>() is used to initialize the Packet Capture
    library. <i>opts</i> specifies options for the library; currently, the
    options are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="PCAP_CHAR_ENC_LOCAL"><a class="permalink" href="#PCAP_CHAR_ENC_LOCAL"><b>PCAP_CHAR_ENC_LOCAL</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Treat all strings supplied as arguments, and return all strings to the
      caller, as being in the local character encoding.</dd>
  <dt id="PCAP_CHAR_ENC_UTF_8"><a class="permalink" href="#PCAP_CHAR_ENC_UTF_8"><b>PCAP_CHAR_ENC_UTF_8</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Treat all strings supplied as arguments, and return all strings to the
      caller, as being in UTF-8.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">On UNIX-like systems, the local character encoding is assumed to
    be UTF-8, so no character encoding transformations are done.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Windows, the local character encoding is the local ANSI code
    page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>pcap_init</b>() is not called, strings are treated as being
    in the local ANSI code page on Windows, <b>pcap_lookupdev</b>(3PCAP) will
    succeed if there is a device on which to capture, and
    <b>pcap_create</b>(3PCAP) makes an attempt to check whether the string
    passed as an argument is a UTF-16LE string - note that this attempt is
    unsafe, as it may run past the end of the string - to handle
    <b>pcap_lookupdev</b>() returning a UTF-16LE string. Programs that don't
    call <b>pcap_init</b>() should, on Windows, call <b>pcap_wsockinit</b>() to
    initialize Winsock; this is not necessary if <b>pcap_init</b>() is called,
    as <b>pcap_init</b>() will initialize Winsock itself on Windows.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN
  VALUE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_init</b>() returns <b>0</b> on success and <b>-1</b> on
    failure. If <b>-1</b> is returned, <i>errbuf</i> is filled in with an
    appropriate error message. <i>errbuf</i> is assumed to be able to hold at
    least <b>PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE</b> chars.</p>

<p class="Pp">This function became available in libpcap release 1.10.0. In
    previous releases, on Windows, all strings supplied as arguments, and all
    strings returned to the caller, are in the local character encoding.</p>
