<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_loop</b>() processes packets from a live capture or
    ``savefile'' until <i>cnt</i> packets are processed, the end of the
    ``savefile'' is reached when reading from a ``savefile'',
    <b>pcap_breakloop</b>(3PCAP) is called, or an error occurs. It does
    <b>not</b> return when live packet buffer timeouts occur. A value of
    <b>-1</b> or <b>0</b> for <i>cnt</i> is equivalent to infinity, so that
    packets are processed until another ending condition occurs.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_dispatch</b>() processes packets from a live capture or
    ``savefile'' until <i>cnt</i> packets are processed, the end of the current
    bufferful of packets is reached when doing a live capture, the end of the
    ``savefile'' is reached when reading from a ``savefile'',
    <b>pcap_breakloop</b>() is called, or an error occurs. Thus, when doing a
    live capture, <i>cnt</i> is the maximum number of packets to process before
    returning, but is not a minimum number; when reading a live capture, only
    one bufferful of packets is read at a time, so fewer than <i>cnt</i> packets
    may be processed. A value of <b>-1</b> or <b>0</b> for <i>cnt</i> causes all
    the packets received in one buffer to be processed when reading a live
    capture, and causes all the packets in the file to be processed when reading
    a ``savefile''.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that, when doing a live capture on some platforms, if the
    read timeout expires when there are no packets available,
    <b>pcap_dispatch</b>() will return 0, even when not in non-blocking mode, as
    there are no packets to process. Applications should be prepared for this to
    happen, but must not rely on it happening.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>callback</i> specifies a <i>pcap_handler</i> routine to be
    called with three arguments: a <i>u_char</i> pointer which is passed in the
    <i>user</i> argument to <b>pcap_loop</b>() or <b>pcap_dispatch</b>(), a
    <i>const struct pcap_pkthdr</i> pointer pointing to the packet time stamp
    and lengths, and a <i>const u_char</i> pointer to the first <b>caplen</b>
    (as given in the <i>struct pcap_pkthdr</i> a pointer to which is passed to
    the callback routine) bytes of data from the packet. The <i>struct
    pcap_pkthdr</i> and the packet data are not to be freed by the callback
    routine, and are not guaranteed to be valid after the callback routine
    returns; if the code needs them to be valid after the callback, it must make
    a copy of them.</p>
<p class="Pp">The bytes of data from the packet begin with a link-layer header.
    The format of the link-layer header is indicated by the return value of the
    <b>pcap_datalink</b>(3PCAP) routine when handed the <b>pcap_t</b> value also
    passed to <b>pcap_loop</b>() or <b>pcap_dispatch</b>().
    <i>https://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html</i> lists the values
    <b>pcap_datalink</b>() can return and describes the packet formats that
    correspond to those values. The value it returns will be valid for all
    packets received unless and until <b>pcap_set_datalink</b>(3PCAP) is called;
    after a successful call to <b>pcap_set_datalink</b>(), all subsequent
    packets will have a link-layer header of the type specified by the
    link-layer header type value passed to <b>pcap_set_datalink</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp">Do <b>NOT</b> assume that the packets for a given capture or
    ``savefile`` will have any given link-layer header type, such as
    <b>DLT_EN10MB</b> for Ethernet. For example, the &quot;any&quot; device on
    Linux will have a link-layer header type of <b>DLT_LINUX_SLL</b> or
    <b>DLT_LINUX_SLL2</b> even if all devices on the system at the time the
    &quot;any&quot; device is opened have some other data link type, such as
    <b>DLT_EN10MB</b> for Ethernet.</p>

  VALUE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_loop</b>() returns <b>0</b> if <i>cnt</i> is exhausted or
    if, when reading from a ``savefile'', no more packets are available. It
    returns <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> if an error occurs or <b>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK</b> if
    the loop terminated due to a call to <b>pcap_breakloop</b>() before any
    packets were processed. It does <b>not</b> return when live packet buffer
    timeouts occur; instead, it attempts to read more packets.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_dispatch</b>() returns the number of packets processed on
    success; this can be 0 if no packets were read from a live capture (if, for
    example, they were discarded because they didn't pass the packet filter, or
    if, on platforms that support a packet buffer timeout that starts before any
    packets arrive, the timeout expires before any packets arrive, or if the
    file descriptor for the capture device is in non-blocking mode and no
    packets were available to be read) or if no more packets are available in a
    ``savefile.'' It returns <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> if an error occurs or
    <b>PCAP_ERROR_BREAK</b> if the loop terminated due to a call to
    <b>pcap_breakloop</b>() before any packets were processed. <b>If your
    application uses pcap_breakloop(),</b> <b>make sure that you explicitly
    check for PCAP_ERROR and PCAP_ERROR_BREAK,</b> <b>rather than just checking
    for a return value &lt; 0.</b></p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> is returned, <b>pcap_geterr</b>(3PCAP) or
    <b>pcap_perror</b>(3PCAP) may be called with <i>p</i> as an argument to
    fetch or display the error text.</p>

  COMPATIBILITY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In libpcap versions before 1.5.0, the behavior when <i>cnt</i> was
    <b>0</b> was undefined; different platforms and devices behaved differently,
    so code that must work with these versions of libpcap should use <b>-1</b>,
    not <b>0</b>, as the value of <i>cnt</i>.</p>
