<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_setdirection()</b> is used to specify a direction that
    packets will be captured. <i>d</i> is one of the constants <b>PCAP_D_IN</b>,
    <b>PCAP_D_OUT</b> or <b>PCAP_D_INOUT</b>. <b>PCAP_D_IN</b> will only capture
    packets received by the device, <b>PCAP_D_OUT</b> will only capture packets
    sent by the device and <b>PCAP_D_INOUT</b> will capture packets received by
    or sent by the device. <b>PCAP_D_INOUT</b> is the default setting if this
    function is not called.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_setdirection()</b> isn't necessarily fully supported on
    all platforms; some platforms might return an error for all values, and some
    other platforms might not support <b>PCAP_D_OUT</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This operation is not supported if a ``savefile'' is being
  read.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_setdirection()</b> returns 0 on success and
    <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> on failure. If <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> is returned,
    <b>pcap_geterr(3PCAP)</b> or <b>pcap_perror(3PCAP)</b> may be called with
    <i>p</i> as an argument to fetch or display the error text.</p>
