<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_compile</b>() is used to compile the string <i>str</i>
    into a filter program. See <b>pcap-filter</b>(7) for the syntax of that
    string. <i>program</i> is a pointer to a <i>bpf_program</i> struct and is
    filled in by <b>pcap_compile</b>(). <i>optimize</i> controls whether
    optimization on the resulting code is performed. <i>netmask</i> specifies
    the IPv4 netmask of the network on which packets are being captured; it is
    used only when checking for IPv4 broadcast addresses in the filter program.
    If the netmask of the network on which packets are being captured isn't
    known to the program, or if packets are being captured on the Linux
    &quot;any&quot; pseudo-interface that can capture on more than one network,
    a value of <b>PCAP_NETMASK_UNKNOWN</b> can be supplied; tests for IPv4
    broadcast addresses will fail to compile, but all other tests in the filter
    program will be OK.</p>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: in libpcap 1.8.0 and later, <b>pcap_compile</b>() can be
    used in multiple threads within a single process. However, in earlier
    versions of libpcap, it is <i>not</i> safe to use <b>pcap_compile</b>() in
    multiple threads in a single process without some form of mutual exclusion
    allowing only one thread to call it at any given time.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN
  VALUE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_compile</b>() returns <b>0</b> on success and
    <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> on failure. If <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> is returned,
    <b>pcap_geterr</b>(3PCAP) or <b>pcap_perror</b>(3PCAP) may be called with
    <i>p</i> as an argument to fetch or display the error text.</p>
