<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_dump_open</b>() is called to open a ``savefile'' for
    writing. <i>fname</i> specifies the name of the file to open. The file will
    have the same format as those used by <b>tcpdump</b>(1) and
    <b>tcpslice</b>(1). If the file does not exist, it will be created; if the
    file exists, it will be truncated and overwritten. The name &quot;-&quot; is
    a synonym for <b>stdout</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_dump_fopen</b>() is called to write data to an existing
    open stream <i>fp</i>; this stream will be closed by a subsequent call to
    <b>pcap_dump_close</b>(3PCAP). The stream is assumed to be at the beginning
    of a file that has been newly created or truncated, so that writes will
    start at the beginning of the file. Note that on Windows, that stream should
    be opened in binary mode.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>p</i> is a capture or ``savefile'' handle returned by an
    earlier call to <b>pcap_create</b>(3PCAP) and activated by an earlier call
    to <b>pcap_activate</b>(3PCAP), or returned by an earlier call to
    <b>pcap_open_offline</b>(3PCAP), <b>pcap_open_live</b>(3PCAP), or
    <b>pcap_open_dead</b>(3PCAP). The time stamp precision, link-layer type, and
    snapshot length from <i>p</i> are used as the link-layer type and snapshot
    length of the output file.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_dump_open_append</b>() is like <b>pcap_dump_open</b>()
    but, if the file already exists, and is a pcap file with the same byte order
    as the host opening the file, and has the same time stamp precision,
    link-layer header type, and snapshot length as <i>p</i>, it will write new
    packets at the end of the file.</p>

<p class="Pp">A pointer to a <b>pcap_dumper_t</b> structure to use in subsequent
    <b>pcap_dump</b>(3PCAP) and <b>pcap_dump_close</b>(3PCAP) calls is returned
    on success. <b>NULL</b> is returned on failure. If <b>NULL</b> is returned,
    <b>pcap_geterr</b>(3PCAP) can be used to get the error text.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <b>pcap_dump_open_append</b>() function became available in
    libpcap release 1.7.2. In previous releases, there is no support for
    appending packets to an existing savefile.</p>
