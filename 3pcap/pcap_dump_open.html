<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_dump_open()</b> is called to open a ``savefile'' for
    writing. <i>fname</i> specifies the name of the file to open. The file will
    have the same format as those used by <b>tcpdump</b>(1) and
    <b>tcpslice</b>(1). The name &quot;-&quot; is a synonym for
  <b>stdout</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_dump_fopen()</b> is called to write data to an existing
    open stream <i>fp</i>; this stream will be closed by a subsequent call to
    <b>pcap_dump_close(3PCAP)</b>. Note that on Windows, that stream should be
    opened in binary mode.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>p</i> is a capture or ``savefile'' handle returned by an
    earlier call to <b>pcap_create(3PCAP)</b> and activated by an earlier call
    to <b>pcap_activate(3PCAP)</b>, or returned by an earlier call to
    <b>pcap_open_offline(3PCAP)</b>, <b>pcap_open_live(3PCAP)</b>, or
    <b>pcap_open_dead(3PCAP)</b>. The time stamp precision, link-layer type, and
    snapshot length from <i>p</i> are used as the link-layer type and snapshot
    length of the output file.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_dump_open_append()</b> is like <b>pcap_dump_open()</b> but
    does not create the file if it does not exist and, if it does already exist,
    and is a pcap file with the same byte order as the host opening the file,
    and has the same time stamp precision, link-layer header type, and snapshot
    length as <i>p</i>, it will write new packets at the end of the file.</p>

<p class="Pp">A pointer to a <b>pcap_dumper_t</b> structure to use in subsequent
    <b>pcap_dump(3PCAP)</b> and <b>pcap_dump_close(3PCAP)</b> calls is returned
    on success. <b>NULL</b> is returned on failure. If <b>NULL</b> is returned,
    <b>pcap_geterr(3PCAP)</b> can be used to get the error text.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <b>pcap_dump_open_append()</b> function became available in
    libpcap release 1.7.2. In previous releases, there is no support for
    appending packets to an existing savefile.</p>
