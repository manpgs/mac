<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_setnonblock()</b> puts a capture handle into
    ``non-blocking'' mode, or takes it out of ``non-blocking'' mode, depending
    on whether the <i>nonblock</i> argument is non-zero or zero. It has no
    effect on ``savefiles''. If there is an error, <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> is returned
    and <i>errbuf</i> is filled in with an appropriate error message; otherwise,
    0 is returned. In ``non-blocking'' mode, an attempt to read from the capture
    descriptor with <b>pcap_dispatch(3PCAP)</b> will, if no packets are
    currently available to be read, return 0 immediately rather than blocking
    waiting for packets to arrive. <b>pcap_loop(3PCAP)</b> and
    <b>pcap_next(3PCAP)</b> will not work in ``non-blocking'' mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">When first activated with <b>pcap_activate(3PCAP)</b> or opened
    with <b>pcap_open_live(3PCAP) ,</b> a capture handle is not in
    ``non-blocking mode''; a call to <b>pcap_setnonblock()</b> is required in
    order to put it into ``non-blocking'' mode.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_getnonblock()</b> returns the current ``non-blocking''
    state of the capture descriptor; it always returns 0 on ``savefiles''. If
    there is an error, <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> is returned and <i>errbuf</i> is filled
    in with an appropriate error message.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>errbuf</i> is assumed to be able to hold at least
    <b>PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE</b> chars.</p>
