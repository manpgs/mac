<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout</b>() returns, on UNIX, a
    pointer to a <b>struct timeval</b> containing a value that must be used as
    the minimum timeout in <b>select</b>(2), <b>poll</b>(2),
    <b>epoll_wait</b>(2), and <b>kevent</b>(2) calls, or <b>NULL</b> if there is
    no such timeout. If a non-<b>NULL</b> value is returned, it must be used
    regardless of whether <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd</b>(3PCAP) returns <b>-1</b>
    for any descriptor on which those calls are being done.
    <b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout</b>() should be called for all
    <b>pcap_t</b>s before a call to <b>select</b>(), <b>poll</b>(),
    <b>epoll_wait</b>(), or <b>kevent</b>(), and any timeouts used for those
    calls should be updated as appropriate given the new value of the
  timeout.</p>
<p class="Pp">For <b>kevent</b>(), one <b>EVFILT_TIMER</b> filter per selectable
    descriptor can be used, rather than using the timeout argument to
    <b>kevent</b>(); if the <b>EVFILT_TIMER</b> event for a particular
    selectable descriptor signals an event, <b>pcap_dispatch</b>(3PCAP) should
    be called for the corresponding <b>pcap_t</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Linux systems with <b>timerfd_create</b>(2), one timer object
    created by <b>timerfd_create</b>() per selectable descriptor can be used,
    rather than using the timeout argument to <b>epoll_wait</b>(); if the timer
    object for a particular selectable descriptor signals an event,
    <b>pcap_dispatch</b>(3PCAP) should be called for the corresponding
    <b>pcap_t</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Otherwise, a timeout value no larger than the smallest of all
    timeouts returned by <b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout</b>() for devices
    from which packets will be captured and any other timeouts to be used in the
    call should be used as the timeout for the call, and, when the call returns,
    <b>pcap_dispatch</b>(3PCAP) should be called for all <b>pcap_t</b>s for
    which a non-<b>NULL</b> timeout was returned, regardless of whether it's
    indicated as having anything to read from it or not.</p>
<p class="Pp">All devices with a non-<b>NULL</b> timeout must be put in
    non-blocking mode with <b>pcap_setnonblock</b>(3PCAP).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that a device on which a read can be done without blocking
    may, on some platforms, not have any packets to read if the packet buffer
    timeout has expired. A call to <b>pcap_dispatch</b>() or
    <b>pcap_next_ex</b>(3PCAP) will return <b>0</b> in this case, but will not
    block.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout</b>() is not available on
    Windows.</p>

<p class="Pp">A pointer to a <b>struct timeval</b> is returned if the timeout is

<h1 class="Sh">BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY</h1>
<p class="Pp">This function became available in libpcap release 1.9.0. In
    previous releases, <b>select</b>(), <b>poll</b>(), <b>epoll_wait</b>(), and
    <b>kevent</b>() cannot be used on any capture source for which
    <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd</b>() returns <b>-1</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In libpcap release 1.10.0 and later, the timeout value can change
    from call to call, so <b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout</b>() must be
    called before each call to <b>select</b>(), <b>poll</b>(),
    <b>epoll_wait</b>(), or <b>kevent</b>(), and the new value must be used to
    calculate timeouts for the call. Code that does that will also work with
    libpcap 1.9.x releases, so code using
    <b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout</b>() should be changed to call it for
    each call to <b>select</b>(), <b>poll</b>(), <b>epoll_wait</b>(), or
    <b>kevent</b>() even if the code must also work with libpcap 1.9.x.</p>
