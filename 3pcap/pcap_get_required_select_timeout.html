<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout()</b> returns, on UNIX, a
    pointer to a <b>struct timeval</b> containing a value that must be used as
    the minimum timeout in <b>select(2)</b>, <b>poll(2)</b>,
    <b>epoll_wait(2)</b>, and <b>kevent()</b> calls if
    <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd(3PCAP)</b> returns <b>PCAP_ERROR</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The timeout that should be used in those calls must be no larger
    than the smallest of all timeouts returned by
    <b>pcap_get_required_select_timeout()</b> for devices from which packets
    will be captured.</p>
<p class="Pp">The device for which <b>pcap_get_selectable_fd()</b> returned
    <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> must be put in non-blocking mode with
    <b>pcap_setnonblock(3PCAP)</b>, and an attempt must always be made to read
    packets from the device when the <b>select()</b>, <b>poll()</b>,
    <b>epoll_wait()</b>, or <b>kevent()</b> call returns.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that a device on which a read can be done without blocking
    may, on some platforms, not have any packets to read if the packet buffer
    timeout has expired. A call to <b>pcap_dispatch(3PCAP)</b> or
    <b>pcap_next_ex(3PCAP)</b> will return 0 in this case, but will not
  block.</p>

    Windows.</p>
