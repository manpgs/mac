<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_dump_ftell()</b> returns the current file position for the
    ``savefile'', representing the number of bytes written by
    <b>pcap_dump_open(3PCAP)</b> and <b>pcap_dump(3PCAP)</b>. <b>PCAP_ERROR</b>
    is returned on error. If the current file position does not fit in a
    <b>long</b>, it will be truncated; this can happen on 32-bit UNIX-like
    systems with large file support and on Windows. <b>pcap_dump_ftell64()</b>
    returns the current file position in a <b>int64_t</b>, so if file offsets
    that don't fit in a <b>long</b> but that fit in a <b>int64_t</b> are
    supported, this will return the file offset without truncation.
    <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> is returned on error.</p>
