<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_inject</b>() sends a raw packet through the network
    interface; <i>buf</i> points to the data of the packet, including the
    link-layer header, and <i>size</i> is the number of bytes in the packet.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that, even if you successfully open the network interface,
    you might not have permission to send packets on it, or it might not support
    sending packets; as <b>pcap_open_live</b>(3PCAP) doesn't have a flag to
    indicate whether to open for capturing, sending, or capturing and sending,
    you cannot request an open that supports sending and be notified at open
    time whether sending will be possible. Note also that some devices might not
    support sending packets.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that, on some platforms, the link-layer header of the packet
    that's sent might not be the same as the link-layer header of the packet
    supplied to <b>pcap_inject</b>(), as the source link-layer address, if the
    header contains such an address, might be changed to be the address assigned
    to the interface on which the packet it sent, if the platform doesn't
    support sending completely raw and unchanged packets. Even worse, some
    drivers on some platforms might change the link-layer type field to whatever
    value libpcap used when attaching to the device, even on platforms that
    <i>do</i> nominally support sending completely raw and unchanged
  packets.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_sendpacket</b>() is like <b>pcap_inject</b>(), but it
    returns <b>0</b> on success, rather than returning the number of bytes
    written. (<b>pcap_inject</b>() comes from OpenBSD; <b>pcap_sendpacket</b>()
    comes from WinPcap/Npcap. Both are provided for compatibility.)</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN

<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_inject</b>() returns the number of bytes written on
    success and <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> on failure.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>pcap_sendpacket</b>() returns <b>0</b> on success and
    <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> on failure.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>PCAP_ERROR</b> is returned, <b>pcap_geterr</b>(3PCAP) or
    <b>pcap_perror</b>(3PCAP) may be called with <i>p</i> as an argument to
    fetch or display the error text.</p>
