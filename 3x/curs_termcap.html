<p class="Pp">These routines are included as a conversion aid for programs that
    use the <i>termcap</i> library. Their parameters are the same and the
    routines are emulated using the <i>terminfo</i> database. Thus, they can
    only be used to query the capabilities of entries for which a terminfo entry
    has been compiled.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="INITIALIZATION"><a class="permalink" href="#INITIALIZATION">INITIALIZATION</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>tgetent</b> routine loads the entry for <i>name</i>. It
    returns:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1</dt>
  <dd>on success,</dd>
  <dt>0</dt>
  <dd>if there is no such entry (or that it is a generic type, having too little
      information for curses applications to run), and</dd>
  <dt>-1</dt>
  <dd>if the terminfo database could not be found.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This differs from the <i>termcap</i> library in two ways:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The emulation ignores the buffer pointer <i>bp</i>. The <i>termcap</i>
      library would store a copy of the terminal description in the area
      referenced by this pointer. However, ncurses stores its terminal
      descriptions in compiled binary form, which is not the same thing.</li>
  <li>There is a difference in return codes. The <i>termcap</i> library does not
      check if the terminal description is marked with the <i>generic</i>
      capability, or if the terminal description has cursor-addressing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="CAPABILITY_VALUES"><a class="permalink" href="#CAPABILITY_VALUES">CAPABILITY
  VALUES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>tgetflag</b> routine gets the boolean entry for <i>id</i>,
    or zero if it is not available.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>tgetnum</b> routine gets the numeric entry for <i>id</i>,
    or -1 if it is not available.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>tgetstr</b> routine returns the string entry for <i>id</i>,
    or zero if it is not available. Use <b>tputs</b> to output the returned
    string. The <i>area</i> parameter is used as follows:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>It is assumed to be the address of a pointer to a buffer managed by the
      calling application.</li>
  <li>However, ncurses checks to ensure that <b>area</b> is not NULL, and also
      that the resulting buffer pointer is not NULL. If either check fails, the
      <i>area</i> parameter is ignored.</li>
  <li>If the checks succeed, ncurses also copies the return value to the buffer
      pointed to by <i>area</i>, and the <i>area</i> value will be updated to
      point past the null ending this value.</li>
  <li>The return value itself is an address in the terminal description which is
      loaded into memory.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Only the first two characters of the <b>id</b> parameter of
    <b>tgetflag</b>, <b>tgetnum</b> and <b>tgetstr</b> are compared in
  lookups.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="FORMATTING_CAPABILITIES"><a class="permalink" href="#FORMATTING_CAPABILITIES">FORMATTING

<p class="Pp">The <b>tgoto</b> routine instantiates the parameters into the
    given capability. The output from this routine is to be passed to
    <b>tputs</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>tputs</b> routine is described on the
    <b>curs_terminfo</b>(3X) manual page. It can retrieve capabilities by either
    termcap or terminfo name.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="GLOBAL_VARIABLES"><a class="permalink" href="#GLOBAL_VARIABLES">GLOBAL
  VARIABLES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The variables <b>PC</b>, <b>UP</b> and <b>BC</b> are set by
    <b>tgetent</b> to the terminfo entry's data for <b>pad_char</b>,
    <b>cursor_up</b> and <b>backspace_if_not_bs</b>, respectively. <b>UP</b> is
    not used by ncurses. <b>PC</b> is used in the <b>tdelay_output</b> function.
    <b>BC</b> is used in the <b>tgoto</b> emulation. The variable <b>ospeed</b>
    is set by ncurses in a system-specific coding to reflect the terminal
  speed.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN
  VALUE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Except where explicitly noted, routines that return an integer
    return <b>ERR</b> upon failure and <b>OK</b> (SVr4 only specifies &quot;an
    integer value other than <b>ERR</b>&quot;) upon successful completion.</p>
<p class="Pp">Routines that return pointers return <b>NULL</b> on error.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If you call <b>tgetstr</b> to fetch <b>ca</b> or any other
    parameterized string, be aware that it will be returned in terminfo
    notation, not the older and not-quite-compatible termcap notation. This will
    not cause problems if all you do with it is call <b>tgoto</b> or
    <b>tparm</b>, which both expand terminfo-style strings as terminfo. (The
    <b>tgoto</b> function, if configured to support termcap, will check if the
    string is indeed terminfo-style by looking for &quot;%p&quot; parameters or
    &quot;$&lt;..&gt;&quot; delays, and invoke a termcap-style parser if the
    string does not appear to be terminfo).</p>
<p class="Pp">Because terminfo conventions for representing padding in string
    capabilities differ from termcap's, <b>tputs(&quot;50&quot;);</b> will put
    out a literal &quot;50&quot; rather than busy-waiting for 50 milliseconds.
    Cope with it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that termcap has nothing analogous to terminfo's <b>sgr</b>
    string. One consequence of this is that termcap applications assume me
    (terminfo <b>sgr0</b>) does not reset the alternate character set. This
    implementation checks for, and modifies the data shown to the termcap
    interface to accommodate termcap's limitation in this respect.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PORTABILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.
    However, they are marked TO BE WITHDRAWN and may be removed in future
    versions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Neither the XSI Curses standard nor the SVr4 man pages documented
    the return values of <b>tgetent</b> correctly, though all three were in fact
    returned ever since SVr1. In particular, an omission in the XSI Curses
    documentation has been misinterpreted to mean that <b>tgetent</b> returns
    <b>OK</b> or <b>ERR</b>. Because the purpose of these functions is to
    provide compatibility with the <i>termcap</i> library, that is a defect in
    XCurses, Issue 4, Version 2 rather than in ncurses.</p>
<p class="Pp">External variables are provided for support of certain termcap
    applications. However, termcap applications' use of those variables is
    poorly documented, e.g., not distinguishing between input and output. In
    particular, some applications are reported to declare and/or modify
    <b>ospeed</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The comment that only the first two characters of the <b>id</b>
    parameter are used escapes many application developers. The original BSD 4.2
    termcap library (and historical relics thereof) did not require a trailing
    null NUL on the parameter name passed to <b>tgetstr</b>, <b>tgetnum</b> and
    <b>tgetflag</b>. Some applications assume that the termcap interface does
    not require the trailing NUL for the parameter name. Taking into account
    these issues:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>As a special case, <b>tgetflag</b> matched against a single-character
      identifier provided that was at the end of the terminal description. You
      should not rely upon this behavior in portable programs. This
      implementation disallows matches against single-character capability
      names.</li>
  <li>This implementation disallows matches by the termcap interface against
      extended capability names which are longer than two characters.</li>
