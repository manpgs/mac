<p class="Pp">The <b>ncurses</b> library provides several functions which let an
    application change way input from the terminal is handled. Some are global,
    applying to all windows. Others apply only to a specific window.
    Window-specific settings are not automatically applied to new or derived
    windows. An application must apply these to each window, if the same
    behavior is needed.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="cbreak"><a class="permalink" href="#cbreak">cbreak</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Normally, the tty driver buffers typed characters until a newline
    or carriage return is typed. The <b>cbreak</b> routine disables line
    buffering and erase/kill character-processing (interrupt and flow control
    characters are unaffected), making characters typed by the user immediately
    available to the program. The <b>nocbreak</b> routine returns the terminal
    to normal (cooked) mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">Initially the terminal may or may not be in <b>cbreak</b> mode, as
    the mode is inherited; therefore, a program should call <b>cbreak</b> or
    <b>nocbreak</b> explicitly. Most interactive programs using <b>curses</b>
    set the <b>cbreak</b> mode. Note that <b>cbreak</b> overrides <b>raw</b>.
    [See <b>curs_getch</b>(3X) for a discussion of how these routines interact
    with <b>echo</b> and <b>noecho</b>.]</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="echo/noecho"><a class="permalink" href="#echo/noecho">echo/noecho</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>echo</b> and <b>noecho</b> routines control whether
    characters typed by the user are echoed by <b>getch</b> as they are typed.
    Echoing by the tty driver is always disabled, but initially <b>getch</b> is
    in echo mode, so characters typed are echoed. Authors of most interactive
    programs prefer to do their own echoing in a controlled area of the screen,
    or not to echo at all, so they disable echoing by calling <b>noecho</b>.
    [See <b>curs_getch</b>(3X) for a discussion of how these routines interact
    with <b>cbreak</b> and <b>nocbreak</b>.]</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="halfdelay"><a class="permalink" href="#halfdelay">halfdelay</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>halfdelay</b> routine is used for half-delay mode, which is
    similar to <b>cbreak</b> mode in that characters typed by the user are
    immediately available to the program. However, after blocking for
    <i>tenths</i> tenths of seconds, ERR is returned if nothing has been typed.
    The value of <b>tenths</b> must be a number between 1 and 255. Use
    <b>nocbreak</b> to leave half-delay mode.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="intrflush"><a class="permalink" href="#intrflush">intrflush</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>intrflush</b> option is enabled, (<i>bf</i> is
    <b>TRUE</b>), when an interrupt key is pressed on the keyboard (interrupt,
    break, quit) all output in the tty driver queue will be flushed, giving the
    effect of faster response to the interrupt, but causing <b>curses</b> to
    have the wrong idea of what is on the screen. Disabling (<i>bf</i> is
    <b>FALSE</b>), the option prevents the flush. The default for the option is
    inherited from the tty driver settings. The window argument is ignored.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="keypad"><a class="permalink" href="#keypad">keypad</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>keypad</b> option enables the keypad of the user's
    terminal. If enabled (<i>bf</i> is <b>TRUE</b>), the user can press a
    function key (such as an arrow key) and <b>wgetch</b> returns a single value
    representing the function key, as in <b>KEY_LEFT</b>. If disabled (<i>bf</i>
    is <b>FALSE</b>), <b>curses</b> does not treat function keys specially and
    the program has to interpret the escape sequences itself. If the keypad in
    the terminal can be turned on (made to transmit) and off (made to work
    locally), turning on this option causes the terminal keypad to be turned on
    when <b>wgetch</b> is called. The default value for keypad is
  <b>FALSE</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="meta"><a class="permalink" href="#meta">meta</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Initially, whether the terminal returns 7 or 8 significant bits on
    input depends on the control mode of the tty driver [see termio(7)]. To
    force 8 bits to be returned, invoke <b>meta</b>(<i>win</i>, <b>TRUE</b>);
    this is equivalent, under POSIX, to setting the CS8 flag on the terminal. To
    force 7 bits to be returned, invoke <b>meta</b>(<i>win</i>, <b>FALSE</b>);
    this is equivalent, under POSIX, to setting the CS7 flag on the terminal.
    The window argument, <i>win</i>, is always ignored. If the terminfo
    capabilities <b>smm</b> (meta_on) and <b>rmm</b> (meta_off) are defined for
    the terminal, <b>smm</b> is sent to the terminal when
    <b>meta</b>(<i>win</i>, <b>TRUE</b>) is called and <b>rmm</b> is sent when
    <b>meta</b>(<i>win</i>, <b>FALSE</b>) is called.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="nodelay"><a class="permalink" href="#nodelay">nodelay</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>nodelay</b> option causes <b>getch</b> to be a non-blocking
    call. If no input is ready, <b>getch</b> returns <b>ERR</b>. If disabled
    (<i>bf</i> is <b>FALSE</b>), <b>getch</b> waits until a key is pressed.</p>
<p class="Pp">While interpreting an input escape sequence, <b>wgetch</b> sets a
    timer while waiting for the next character. If <b>notimeout(</b><i>win</i>,
    <b>TRUE</b>) is called, then <b>wgetch</b> does not set a timer. The purpose
    of the timeout is to differentiate between sequences received from a
    function key and those typed by a user.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="raw/noraw"><a class="permalink" href="#raw/noraw">raw/noraw</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>raw</b> and <b>noraw</b> routines place the terminal into
    or out of raw mode. Raw mode is similar to <b>cbreak</b> mode, in that
    characters typed are immediately passed through to the user program. The
    differences are that in raw mode, the interrupt, quit, suspend, and flow
    control characters are all passed through uninterpreted, instead of
    generating a signal. The behavior of the BREAK key depends on other bits in
    the tty driver that are not set by <b>curses</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="noqiflush"><a class="permalink" href="#noqiflush">noqiflush</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>noqiflush</b> routine is used, normal flush of input
    and output queues associated with the <b>INTR</b>, <b>QUIT</b> and
    <b>SUSP</b> characters will not be done [see termio(7)]. When <b>qiflush</b>
    is called, the queues will be flushed when these control characters are
    read. You may want to call <b>noqiflush()</b> in a signal handler if you
    want output to continue as though the interrupt had not occurred, after the
    handler exits.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="timeout/wtimeout"><a class="permalink" href="#timeout/wtimeout">timeout/wtimeout</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>timeout</b> and <b>wtimeout</b> routines set blocking or
    non-blocking read for a given window. If <i>delay</i> is negative, blocking
    read is used (i.e., waits indefinitely for input). If <i>delay</i> is zero,
    then non-blocking read is used (i.e., read returns <b>ERR</b> if no input is
    waiting). If <i>delay</i> is positive, then read blocks for <i>delay</i>
    milliseconds, and returns <b>ERR</b> if there is still no input. Hence,
    these routines provide the same functionality as <b>nodelay</b>, plus the
    additional capability of being able to block for only <i>delay</i>
    milliseconds (where <i>delay</i> is positive).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="typeahead"><a class="permalink" href="#typeahead">typeahead</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>curses</b> library does &#x201C;line-breakout
    optimization&#x201D; by looking for typeahead periodically while updating
    the screen. If input is found, and it is coming from a tty, the current
    update is postponed until <b>refresh</b> or <b>doupdate</b> is called again.
    This allows faster response to commands typed in advance. Normally, the
    input FILE pointer passed to <b>newterm</b>, or <b>stdin</b> in the case
    that <b>initscr</b> was used, will be used to do this typeahead checking.
    The <b>typeahead</b> routine specifies that the file descriptor <i>fd</i> is
    to be used to check for typeahead instead. If <i>fd</i> is -1, then no
    typeahead checking is done.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN
  VALUE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">All routines that return an integer return <b>ERR</b> upon failure
    and OK (SVr4 specifies only &quot;an integer value other than
    <b>ERR</b>&quot;) upon successful completion, unless otherwise noted in the
    preceding routine descriptions.</p>
<p class="Pp">X/Open does not define any error conditions. In this
    implementation, functions with a window parameter will return an error if it
    is null. Any function will also return an error if the terminal was not
    initialized. Also,</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>halfdelay</b></dt>
  <dd>returns an error if its parameter is outside the range 1..255.</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PORTABILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue
  4.</p>
<p class="Pp">The ncurses library obeys the XPG4 standard and the historical
    practice of the AT&amp;T curses implementations, in that the echo bit is
    cleared when curses initializes the terminal state. BSD curses differed from
    this slightly; it left the echo bit on at initialization, but the BSD
    <b>raw</b> call turned it off as a side-effect. For best portability, set
    echo or noecho explicitly just after initialization, even if your program
    remains in cooked mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>keypad</b> is first enabled, ncurses loads the
    key-definitions for the current terminal description. If the terminal
    description includes extended string capabilities, e.g., from using the
    <b>-x</b> option of tic, then ncurses also defines keys for the capabilities
    whose names begin with &quot;k&quot;. The corresponding keycodes are
    generated and (depending on previous loads of terminal descriptions) may
    differ from one execution of a program to the next. The generated keycodes
    are recognized by the <b>keyname</b> function (which will then return a name
    beginning with &quot;k&quot; denoting the terminfo capability name rather
    than &quot;K&quot;, used for curses key-names). On the other hand, an
    application can use <b>define_key</b> to establish a specific keycode for a
    given string. This makes it possible for an application to check for an
    extended capability's presence with <i>tigetstr</i>, and reassign the
    keycode to match its own needs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Low-level applications can use <b>tigetstr</b> to obtain the
    definition of any particular string capability. Higher-level applications
    which use the curses <b>wgetch</b> and similar functions to return keycodes
    rely upon the order in which the strings are loaded. If more than one key
    definition has the same string value, then <b>wgetch</b> can return only one
    keycode. Most curses implementations (including ncurses) load key
    definitions in the order defined by the array of string capability names.
    The last key to be loaded determines the keycode which will be returned. In
    ncurses, you may also have extended capabilities interpreted as key
    definitions. These are loaded after the predefined keys, and if a
    capability's value is the same as a previously-loaded key definition, the
    later definition is the one used.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Note that <b>echo</b>, <b>noecho</b>, <b>halfdelay</b>,
    <b>intrflush</b>, <b>meta</b>, <b>nodelay</b>, <b>notimeout</b>,
    <b>noqiflush</b>, <b>qiflush</b>, <b>timeout</b>, and <b>wtimeout</b> may be
    macros.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>noraw</b> and <b>nocbreak</b> calls follow historical
    practice in that they attempt to restore to normal (`cooked') mode from raw
    and cbreak modes respectively. Mixing raw/noraw and cbreak/nocbreak calls
    leads to tty driver control states that are hard to predict or understand;
    it is not recommended.</p>
