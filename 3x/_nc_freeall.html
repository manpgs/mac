<p class="Pp">These functions are used to simplify analysis of memory leaks in
    the ncurses library. They are normally not available; they must be
    configured into the library at build time using the <b>--disable-leaks</b>
    option. That compiles-in code that frees memory that normally would not be
    freed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any implementation of curses must not free the memory associated
    with a screen, since (even after calling <b>endwin</b>), it must be
    available for use in the next call to <b>refresh</b>. There are also chunks
    of memory held for performance reasons. That makes it hard to analyze curses
    applications for memory leaks. To work around this, one can build a
    debugging version of the ncurses library which frees those chunks which it
    can, and provides these functions to free all of the memory allocated by the
    ncurses library.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>_nc_free_and_exit</b> function is the preferred one since
    some of the memory which is freed may be required for the application to
    continue running. Its parameter is the code to pass to the <b>exit</b>
    routine.</p>
