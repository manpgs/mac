<p class="Pp">The <b>scanw</b>, <b>wscanw</b> and <b>mvscanw</b> routines are
    analogous to <b>scanf</b> [see <b>scanf</b>(3)]. The effect of these
    routines is as though <b>wgetstr</b> were called on the window, and the
    resulting line used as input for <b>sscanf</b>(3). Fields which do not map
    to a variable in the <i>fmt</i> field are lost.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>vwscanw</b> and <b>vw_scanw</b> routines are analogous to
    <b>vscanf</b>. They perform a <b>wscanw</b> using a variable argument list.
    The third argument is a <i>va_list</i>, a pointer to a list of arguments, as
    defined in <b>&lt;stdarg.h&gt;</b>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN
  VALUE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>vwscanw</b> returns <b>ERR</b> on failure and an integer equal
    to the number of fields scanned on success.</p>
<p class="Pp">Applications may use the return value from the <b>scanw</b>,
    <b>wscanw</b>, <b>mvscanw</b> and <b>mvwscanw</b> routines to determine the
    number of fields which were mapped in the call.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PORTABILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions. The
    function <b>vwscanw</b> is marked TO BE WITHDRAWN, and is to be replaced by
    a function <b>vw_scanw</b> using the <b>&lt;stdarg.h&gt;</b> interface. The
    Single Unix Specification, Version 2 states that <b>vw_scanw</b> is
    preferred to <b>vwscanw</b> since the latter requires including
    <b>&lt;varargs.h&gt;</b>, which cannot be used in the same file as
    <b>&lt;stdarg.h&gt;</b>. This implementation uses <b>&lt;stdarg.h&gt;</b>
    for both, because that header is included in <b>&lt;curses.h</b>&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both XSI and The Single Unix Specification, Version 2 state that
    these functions return ERR or OK. Since the underlying <b>scanf</b> can
    return the number of items scanned, and the SVr4 code was documented to use
    this feature, this is probably an editing error which was introduced in XSI,
    rather than being done intentionally. Portable applications should only test
    if the return value is ERR, since the OK value (zero) is likely to be
    misleading. One possible way to get useful results would be to use a
    &quot;%n&quot; conversion at the end of the format string to ensure that
    something was processed.</p>
