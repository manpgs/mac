<p class="Pp"><b>initscr</b> is normally the first <b>curses</b> routine to call
    when initializing a program. A few special routines sometimes need to be
    called before it; these are <b>slk_init</b>, <b>filter</b>,
    <b>ripoffline</b>, <b>use_env</b>. For multiple-terminal applications,
    <b>newterm</b> may be called before <b>initscr</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The initscr code determines the terminal type and initializes all
    <b>curses</b> data structures. <b>initscr</b> also causes the first call to
    <b>refresh</b> to clear the screen. If errors occur, <b>initscr</b> writes
    an appropriate error message to standard error and exits; otherwise, a
    pointer is returned to <b>stdscr</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">A program that outputs to more than one terminal should use the
    <b>newterm</b> routine for each terminal instead of <b>initscr</b>. A
    program that needs to inspect capabilities, so it can continue to run in a
    line-oriented mode if the terminal cannot support a screen-oriented program,
    would also use <b>newterm</b>. The routine <b>newterm</b> should be called
    once for each terminal. It returns a variable of type <b>SCREEN *</b> which
    should be saved as a reference to that terminal. The arguments are the
    <i>type</i> of the terminal to be used in place of <b>$TERM</b>, a file
    pointer for output to the terminal, and another file pointer for input from
    the terminal (if <i>type</i> is <b>NULL</b>, <b>$TERM</b> will be used). The
    program must also call <b>endwin</b> for each terminal being used before
    exiting from <b>curses</b>. If <b>newterm</b> is called more than once for
    the same terminal, the first terminal referred to must be the last one for
    which <b>endwin</b> is called.</p>
<p class="Pp">A program should always call <b>endwin</b> before exiting or
    escaping from <b>curses</b> mode temporarily. This routine restores tty
    modes, moves the cursor to the lower left-hand corner of the screen and
    resets the terminal into the proper non-visual mode. Calling <b>refresh</b>
    or <b>doupdate</b> after a temporary escape causes the program to resume
    visual mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>isendwin</b> routine returns <b>TRUE</b> if <b>endwin</b>
    has been called without any subsequent calls to <b>wrefresh</b>, and
    <b>FALSE</b> otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>set_term</b> routine is used to switch between different
    terminals. The screen reference <b>new</b> becomes the new current terminal.
    The previous terminal is returned by the routine. This is the only routine
    which manipulates <b>SCREEN</b> pointers; all other routines affect only the
    current terminal.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>delscreen</b> routine frees storage associated with the
    <b>SCREEN</b> data structure. The <b>endwin</b> routine does not do this, so
    <b>delscreen</b> should be called after <b>endwin</b> if a particular
    <b>SCREEN</b> is no longer needed.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN
  VALUE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>endwin</b> returns the integer <b>ERR</b> upon failure and
    <b>OK</b> upon successful completion.</p>
<p class="Pp">Routines that return pointers always return <b>NULL</b> on
  error.</p>
<p class="Pp">X/Open defines no error conditions. In this implementation
    <b>endwin</b> returns an error if the terminal was not initialized.</p>

<p class="Pp">These functions are described in the XSI Curses standard, Issue 4.
    It specifies that portable applications must not call <b>initscr</b> more
    than once.</p>
<p class="Pp">Old versions of curses, e.g., BSD 4.4, may have returned a null
    pointer from <b>initscr</b> when an error is detected, rather than exiting.
    It is safe but redundant to check the return value of <b>initscr</b> in XSI
    Curses.</p>
