   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">Tcl defines three special channels that are used by various I/O
    related commands if no other channels are specified. The standard input
    channel has a channel name of <b>stdin</b> and is used by <b>read</b> and
    <b>gets</b>. The standard output channel is named <b>stdout</b> and is used
    by <b>puts</b>. The standard error channel is named <b>stderr</b> and is
    used for reporting errors. In addition, the standard channels are inherited
    by any child processes created using <b>exec</b> or <b>open</b> in the
    absence of any other redirections.</p>
<p class="Pp">The standard channels are actually aliases for other normal
    channels. The current channel associated with a standard channel can be
    retrieved by calling <b>Tcl_GetStdChannel</b> with one of <b>TCL_STDIN</b>,
    <b>TCL_STDOUT</b>, or <b>TCL_STDERR</b> as the <i>type</i>. The return value
    will be a valid channel, or NULL.</p>
<p class="Pp">A new channel can be set for the standard channel specified by
    <i>type</i> by calling <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b> with a new channel or NULL
    in the <i>channel</i> argument. If the specified channel is closed by a
    later call to <b>Tcl_Close</b>, then the corresponding standard channel will
    automatically be set to NULL.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a non-NULL value for <i>channel</i> is passed to
    <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b>, then that same value should be passed to
    <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b>, like so:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
Tcl_RegisterChannel(NULL, channel);
</pre>
</div>
This is a workaround for a misfeature in <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b> that it fails
  to do some reference counting housekeeping. This misfeature cannot be
  corrected without contradicting the assumptions of some existing code that
  calls <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b>.
<p class="Pp">If <b>Tcl_GetStdChannel</b> is called before
    <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b>, Tcl will construct a new channel to wrap the
    appropriate platform-specific standard file handle. If
    <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b> is called before <b>Tcl_GetStdChannel</b>, then the
    default channel will not be created.</p>
<p class="Pp">If one of the standard channels is set to NULL, either by calling
    <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b> with a NULL <i>channel</i> argument, or by calling
    <b>Tcl_Close</b> on the channel, then the next call to
    <b>Tcl_CreateChannel</b> will automatically set the standard channel with
    the newly created channel. If more than one standard channel is NULL, then
    the standard channels will be assigned starting with standard input,
    followed by standard output, with standard error being last.</p>
<p class="Pp">See <b>Tcl_StandardChannels</b> for a general treatise about
    standard channels and the behaviour of the Tcl library with regard to
  them.</p>
