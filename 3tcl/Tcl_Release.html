   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">These three procedures help implement a simple reference count
    mechanism for managing storage. They are designed to solve a problem having
    to do with widget deletion, but are also useful in many other situations.
    When a widget is deleted, its widget record (the structure holding
    information specific to the widget) must be returned to the storage
    allocator. However, it is possible that the widget record is in active use
    by one of the procedures on the stack at the time of the deletion. This can
    happen, for example, if the command associated with a button widget causes
    the button to be destroyed: an X event causes an event-handling C procedure
    in the button to be invoked, which in turn causes the button's associated
    Tcl command to be executed, which in turn causes the button to be deleted,
    which in turn causes the button's widget record to be de-allocated.
    Unfortunately, when the Tcl command returns, the button's event-handling
    procedure will need to reference the button's widget record. Because of
    this, the widget record must not be freed as part of the deletion, but must
    be retained until the event-handling procedure has finished with it. In
    other situations where the widget is deleted, it may be possible to free the
    widget record immediately.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Preserve</b> and <b>Tcl_Release</b> implement short-term
    reference counts for their <i>clientData</i> argument. The <i>clientData</i>
    argument identifies an object and usually consists of the address of a
    structure. The reference counts guarantee that an object will not be freed
    until each call to <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> for the object has been matched by
    calls to <b>Tcl_Release</b>. There may be any number of unmatched
    <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> calls in effect at once.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_EventuallyFree</b> is invoked to free up its
    <i>clientData</i> argument. It checks to see if there are unmatched
    <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> calls for the object. If not, then
    <b>Tcl_EventuallyFree</b> calls <i>freeProc</i> immediately. Otherwise
    <b>Tcl_EventuallyFree</b> records the fact that <i>clientData</i> needs
    eventually to be freed. When all calls to <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> have been
    matched with calls to <b>Tcl_Release</b> then <i>freeProc</i> will be called
    by <b>Tcl_Release</b> to do the cleanup.</p>
<p class="Pp">All the work of freeing the object is carried out by
    <i>freeProc</i>. <i>FreeProc</i> must have arguments and result that match
    the type <b>Tcl_FreeProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef void Tcl_FreeProc(char *<i>blockPtr</i>);</pre>
</div>
The <i>blockPtr</i> argument to <i>freeProc</i> will be the same as the
  <i>clientData</i> argument to <b>Tcl_EventuallyFree</b>. The type of
  <i>blockPtr</i> (<b>char *</b>) is different than the type of the
  <i>clientData</i> argument to <b>Tcl_EventuallyFree</b> for historical
  reasons, but the value is the same.
<p class="Pp">When the <i>clientData</i> argument to <b>Tcl_EventuallyFree</b>
    refers to storage allocated and returned by a prior call to
    <b>Tcl_Alloc</b>, <b>ckalloc</b>, or another function of the Tcl library,
    then the <i>freeProc</i> argument should be given the special value of
    <b>TCL_DYNAMIC</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This mechanism can be used to solve the problem described above by
    placing <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> and <b>Tcl_Release</b> calls around actions that
    may cause undesired storage re-allocation. The mechanism is intended only
    for short-term use (i.e. while procedures are pending on the stack); it will
    not work efficiently as a mechanism for long-term reference counts. The
    implementation does not depend in any way on the internal structure of the
    objects being freed; it keeps the reference counts in a separate
  structure.</p>
