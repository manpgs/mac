   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Tk_Font <i>tkfont</i> (in)</dt>
  <dd>Font to use when constructing and displaying a text layout. The
      <i>tkfont</i> must remain valid for the lifetime of the text layout. Must
      have been returned by a previous call to <b>Tk_GetFont</b>.</dd>
  <dt>const char <i>*string</i> (in)</dt>
  <dd>Potentially multi-line string whose dimensions are to be computed and
      stored in the text layout. The <i>string</i> must remain valid for the
      lifetime of the text layout.</dd>
  <dt>int <i>numChars</i> (in)</dt>
  <dd>The number of characters to consider from <i>string</i>. If
      <i>numChars</i> is less than 0, then assumes <i>string</i> is null
      terminated and uses <b>Tcl_NumUtfChars</b> to determine the length of
      <i>string</i>.</dd>
  <dt>int <i>wrapLength</i> (in)</dt>
  <dd>Longest permissible line length, in pixels. Lines in <i>string</i> will
      automatically be broken at word boundaries and wrapped when they reach
      this length. If <i>wrapLength</i> is too small for even a single character
      to fit on a line, it will be expanded to allow one character to fit on
      each line. If <i>wrapLength</i> is &lt;= 0, there is no automatic
      wrapping; lines will get as long as they need to be and only wrap if a
      newline/return character is encountered.</dd>
  <dt>Tk_Justify <i>justify</i> (in)</dt>
  <dd>How to justify the lines in a multi-line text layout. Possible values are
      <b>TK_JUSTIFY_LEFT</b>, <b>TK_JUSTIFY_CENTER</b>, or
      <b>TK_JUSTIFY_RIGHT</b>. If the text layout only occupies a single line,
      then <i>justify</i> is irrelevant.</dd>
  <dt>int <i>flags</i> (in)</dt>
  <dd>Various flag bits OR-ed together. <b>TK_IGNORE_TABS</b> means that tab
      characters should not be expanded to the next tab stop.
      <b>TK_IGNORE_NEWLINES</b> means that newline/return characters should not
      cause a line break. If either tabs or newlines/returns are ignored, then
      they will be treated as regular characters, being measured and displayed
      in a platform-dependent manner as described in <b>Tk_MeasureChars</b>, and
      will not have any special behaviors.</dd>
  <dt>int <i>*widthPtr</i> (out)</dt>
  <dd>If non-NULL, filled with either the width, in pixels, of the widest line
      in the text layout, or the width, in pixels, of the bounding box for the
      character specified by <i>index</i>.</dd>
  <dt>int <i>*heightPtr</i> (out)</dt>
  <dd>If non-NULL, filled with either the total height, in pixels, of all the

      for the character specified by <i>index</i>.</dd>
  <dt>Tk_TextLayout <i>layout</i> (in)</dt>
  <dd>A token that represents the cached layout information about the

  <dt>GC <i>gc</i> (in)</dt>
  <dd>Graphics context to use for drawing text layout. The font selected in this
      GC must correspond to the <i>tkfont</i> used when constructing the text
      layout.</dd>
  <dt>int <i>x, y</i> (in)</dt>
  <dd>Point, in pixels, at which to place the upper-left hand corner of the text
      layout when it is being drawn, or the coordinates of a point (with respect
      to the upper-left hand corner of the text layout) to check against the
      text layout.</dd>
  <dt>int <i>firstChar</i> (in)</dt>
  <dd>The index of the first character to draw from the given text layout. The
      number 0 means to draw from the beginning.</dd>
  <dt>int <i>lastChar</i> (in)</dt>
  <dd>The index of the last character up to which to draw. The character
      specified by <i>lastChar</i> itself will not be drawn. A number less than
      0 means to draw all characters in the text layout.</dd>
  <dt>int <i>underline</i> (in)</dt>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">These routines are for measuring and displaying single-font,
    multi-line, justified text. To measure and display simple single-font,
    single-line strings, refer to the documentation for <b>Tk_MeasureChars</b>.
    There is no programming interface in the core of Tk that supports
    multi-font, multi-line text; support for that behavior must be built on top
    of simpler layers. Note that unlike the lower level text display routines,
    the functions described here all operate on character-oriented lengths and
    indices rather than byte-oriented values. See the description of
    <b>Tcl_UtfAtIndex</b> for more details on converting between character and
    byte offsets.</p>
<p class="Pp">The routines described here are built on top of the programming
    interface described in the <b>Tk_MeasureChars</b> documentation. Tab
    characters and newline/return characters may be treated specially by these
    procedures, but all other characters are passed through to the lower
  level.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_ComputeTextLayout</b> computes the layout information needed
    to display a single-font, multi-line, justified <i>string</i> of text and
    returns a Tk_TextLayout token that holds this information. This token is
    used in subsequent calls to procedures such as <b>Tk_DrawTextLayout</b>,
    <b>Tk_DistanceToTextLayout</b>, and <b>Tk_FreeTextLayout</b>. The
    <i>string</i> and <i>tkfont</i> used when computing the layout must remain
    valid for the lifetime of this token.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_FreeTextLayout</b> is called to release the storage
    associated with <i>layout</i> when it is no longer needed. A <i>layout</i>
    should not be used in any other text layout procedures once it has been
    released.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_DrawTextLayout</b> uses the information in <i>layout</i> to
    display a single-font, multi-line, justified string of text at the specified
    location.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_UnderlineTextLayout</b> uses the information in
    <i>layout</i> to display an underline below an individual character. This
    procedure does not draw the text, just the underline. To produce natively
    underlined text, an underlined font should be constructed and used. All
    characters, including tabs, newline/return characters, and spaces at the
    ends of lines, can be underlined using this method. However, the underline
    will never be drawn outside of the computed width of <i>layout</i>; the
    underline will stop at the edge for any character that would extend
    partially outside of <i>layout</i>, and the underline will not be visible at
    all for any character that would be located completely outside of the
    layout.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_PointToChar</b> uses the information in <i>layout</i> to
    determine the character closest to the given point. The point is specified
    with respect to the upper-left hand corner of the <i>layout</i>, which is
    considered to be located at (0, 0). Any point whose <i>y</i>-value is less
    that 0 will be considered closest to the first character in the text layout;
    any point whose <i>y</i>-value is greater than the height of the text layout
    will be considered closest to the last character in the text layout. Any
    point whose <i>x</i>-value is less than 0 will be considered closest to the
    first character on that line; any point whose <i>x</i>-value is greater than
    the width of the text layout will be considered closest to the last
    character on that line. The return value is the index of the character that
    was closest to the point. Given a <i>layout</i> with no characters, the
    value 0 will always be returned, referring to a hypothetical zero-width
    placeholder character.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_CharBbox</b> uses the information in <i>layout</i> to return
    the bounding box for the character specified by <i>index</i>. The width of
    the bounding box is the advance width of the character, and does not include
    any left or right bearing. Any character that extends partially outside of
    <i>layout</i> is considered to be truncated at the edge. Any character that
    would be located completely outside of <i>layout</i> is considered to be
    zero-width and pegged against the edge. The height of the bounding box is
    the line height for this font, extending from the top of the ascent to the
    bottom of the descent; information about the actual height of individual
    letters is not available. For measurement purposes, a <i>layout</i> that
    contains no characters is considered to contain a single zero-width
    placeholder character at index 0. If <i>index</i> was not a valid character
    index, the return value is 0 and <i>*xPtr</i>, <i>*yPtr</i>,
    <i>*widthPtr</i>, and <i>*heightPtr</i> are unmodified. Otherwise, if
    <i>index</i> did specify a valid, the return value is non-zero, and
    <i>*xPtr</i>, <i>*yPtr</i>, <i>*widthPtr</i>, and <i>*heightPtr</i> are
    filled with the bounding box information for the character. If any of
    <i>xPtr</i>, <i>yPtr</i>, <i>widthPtr</i>, or <i>heightPtr</i> are NULL, the
    corresponding value is not calculated or stored.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_DistanceToTextLayout</b> computes the shortest distance in
    pixels from the given point (<i>x, y</i>) to the characters in
    <i>layout</i>. Newline/return characters and non-displaying space characters
    that occur at the end of individual lines in the text layout are ignored for
    hit detection purposes, but tab characters are not. The return value is 0 if
    the point actually hits the <i>layout</i>. If the point did not hit the
    <i>layout</i> then the return value is the distance in pixels from the point
    to the <i>layout</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_IntersectTextLayout</b> determines whether a <i>layout</i>
    lies entirely inside, entirely outside, or overlaps a given rectangle.
    Newline/return characters and non-displaying space characters that occur at
    the end of individual lines in the <i>layout</i> are ignored for
    intersection calculations. The return value is -1 if the <i>layout</i> is
    entirely outside of the rectangle, 0 if it overlaps, and 1 if it is entirely
    inside of the rectangle.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_TextLayoutToPostscript</b> outputs code consisting of a
    Postscript array of strings that represent the individual lines in
    <i>layout</i>. It is the responsibility of the caller to take the Postscript
    array of strings and add some Postscript function operate on the array to
    render each of the lines. The code that represents the Postscript array of
    strings is appended to <i>interp-&gt;result</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DISPLAY_MODEL"><a class="permalink" href="#DISPLAY_MODEL">DISPLAY
  MODEL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When measuring a text layout, space characters that occur at the
    end of a line are ignored. The space characters still exist and the
    insertion point can be positioned amongst them, but their additional width
    is ignored when justifying lines or returning the total width of a text
    layout. All end-of-line space characters are considered to be attached to
    the right edge of the line; this behavior is logical for left-justified text
    and reasonable for center-justified text, but not very useful when editing
    right-justified text. Spaces are considered variable width characters; the
    first space that extends past the edge of the text layout is clipped to the
    edge, and any subsequent spaces on the line are considered zero width and
    pegged against the edge. Space characters that occur in the middle of a line
    of text are not suppressed and occupy their normal space width.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tab characters are not ignored for measurement calculations. If
    wrapping is turned on and there are enough tabs on a line, the next tab will
    wrap to the beginning of the next line. There are some possible strange
    interactions between tabs and justification; tab positions are calculated
    and the line length computed in a left-justified world, and then the whole
    resulting line is shifted so it is centered or right-justified, causing the
    tab columns not to align any more.</p>
<p class="Pp">When wrapping is turned on, lines may wrap at word breaks (space
    or tab characters) or newline/returns. A dash or hyphen character in the
    middle of a word is not considered a word break. <b>Tk_ComputeTextLayout</b>
    always attempts to place at least one word on each line. If it cannot
    because the <i>wrapLength</i> is too small, the word will be broken and as
    much as fits placed on the line and the rest on subsequent line(s). If
    <i>wrapLength</i> is so small that not even one character can fit on a given
    line, the <i>wrapLength</i> is ignored for that line and one character will
    be placed on the line anyhow. When wrapping is turned off, only
    newline/return characters may cause a line break.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a text layout has been created using an underlined
    <i>tkfont</i>, then any space characters that occur at the end of individual
    lines, newlines/returns, and tabs will not be displayed underlined when
    <b>Tk_DrawTextLayout</b> is called, because those characters are never
    actually drawn - they are merely placeholders maintained in the
    <i>layout</i>.</p>
