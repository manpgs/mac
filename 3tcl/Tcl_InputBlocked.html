   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The Tcl channel mechanism provides a device-independent and
    platform-independent mechanism for performing buffered input and output
    operations on a variety of file, socket, and device types. The channel
    mechanism is extensible to new channel types, by providing a low-level
    channel driver for the new type; the channel driver interface is described
    in the manual entry for <b>Tcl_CreateChannel</b>. The channel mechanism
    provides a buffering scheme modeled after Unix's standard I/O, and it also
    allows for nonblocking I/O on channels.</p>
<p class="Pp">The procedures described in this manual entry comprise the C APIs
    of the generic layer of the channel architecture. For a description of the
    channel driver architecture and how to implement channel drivers for new
    types of channels, see the manual entry for <b>Tcl_CreateChannel</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TCL_OPENFILECHANNEL"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_OPENFILECHANNEL">TCL_OPENFILECHANNEL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_OpenFileChannel</b> opens a file specified by
    <i>fileName</i> and returns a channel handle that can be used to perform
    input and output on the file. This API is modeled after the <b>fopen</b>
    procedure of the Unix standard I/O library. The syntax and meaning of all
    arguments is similar to those given in the Tcl <b>open</b> command when
    opening a file. If an error occurs while opening the channel,
    <b>Tcl_OpenFileChannel</b> returns NULL and records a POSIX error code that
    can be retrieved with <b>Tcl_GetErrno</b>. In addition, if <i>interp</i> is
    non-NULL, <b>Tcl_OpenFileChannel</b> leaves an error message in
    <i>interp</i>'s result after any error. As of Tcl 8.4, the object-based API
    <b>Tcl_FSOpenFileChannel</b> should be used in preference to
    <b>Tcl_OpenFileChannel</b> wherever possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied
    interpreter; to register it, use <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b>, described
    below. If one of the standard channels, <b>stdin, stdout</b> or
    <b>stderr</b> was previously closed, the act of creating the new channel
    also assigns it as a replacement for the standard channel.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TCL_OPENCOMMANDCHANNEL"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_OPENCOMMANDCHANNEL">TCL_OPENCOMMANDCHANNEL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_OpenCommandChannel</b> provides a C-level interface to the
    functions of the <b>exec</b> and <b>open</b> commands. It creates a sequence
    of subprocesses specified by the <i>argv</i> and <i>argc</i> arguments and
    returns a channel that can be used to communicate with these subprocesses.
    The <i>flags</i> argument indicates what sort of communication will exist
    with the command pipeline.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>TCL_STDIN</b> flag is set then the standard input for
    the first subprocess will be tied to the channel: writing to the channel
    will provide input to the subprocess. If <b>TCL_STDIN</b> is not set, then
    standard input for the first subprocess will be the same as this
    application's standard input. If <b>TCL_STDOUT</b> is set then standard
    output from the last subprocess can be read from the channel; otherwise it
    goes to this application's standard output. If <b>TCL_STDERR</b> is set,
    standard error output for all subprocesses is returned to the channel and
    results in an error when the channel is closed; otherwise it goes to this
    application's standard error. If <b>TCL_ENFORCE_MODE</b> is not set, then
    <i>argc</i> and <i>argv</i> can redirect the stdio handles to override
    <b>TCL_STDIN</b>, <b>TCL_STDOUT</b>, and <b>TCL_STDERR</b>; if it is set,
    then it is an error for argc and argv to override stdio channels for which
    <b>TCL_STDIN</b>, <b>TCL_STDOUT</b>, and <b>TCL_STDERR</b> have been
  set.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an error occurs while opening the channel,
    <b>Tcl_OpenCommandChannel</b> returns NULL and records a POSIX error code
    that can be retrieved with <b>Tcl_GetErrno</b>. In addition,
    <b>Tcl_OpenCommandChannel</b> leaves an error message in the interpreter's
    result if <i>interp</i> is not NULL.</p>
<p class="Pp">The newly created channel is not registered in the supplied
    interpreter; to register it, use <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b>, described
    below. If one of the standard channels, <b>stdin, stdout</b> or
    <b>stderr</b> was previously closed, the act of creating the new channel
    also assigns it as a replacement for the standard channel.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="TCL_MAKEFILECHANNEL"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_MAKEFILECHANNEL">TCL_MAKEFILECHANNEL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_MakeFileChannel</b> makes a <b>Tcl_Channel</b> from an
    existing, platform-specific, file handle. The newly created channel is not
    registered in the supplied interpreter; to register it, use
    <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b>, described below. If one of the standard
    channels, <b>stdin, stdout</b> or <b>stderr</b> was previously closed, the
    act of creating the new channel also assigns it as a replacement for the

<h1 class="Sh" id="TCL_GETCHANNEL"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_GETCHANNEL">TCL_GETCHANNEL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_GetChannel</b> returns a channel given the
    <i>channelName</i> used to create it with <b>Tcl_CreateChannel</b> and a
    pointer to a Tcl interpreter in <i>interp</i>. If a channel by that name is
    not registered in that interpreter, the procedure returns NULL. If the
    <i>modePtr</i> argument is not NULL, it points at an integer variable that
    will receive an OR-ed combination of <b>TCL_READABLE</b> and
    <b>TCL_WRITABLE</b> describing whether the channel is open for reading and
    writing.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_GetChannelNames</b> and <b>Tcl_GetChannelNamesEx</b> write
    the names of the registered channels to the interpreter's result as a list
    object. <b>Tcl_GetChannelNamesEx</b> will filter these names according to
    the <i>pattern</i>. If <i>pattern</i> is NULL, then it will not do any
    filtering. The return value is <b>TCL_OK</b> if no errors occurred writing
    to the result, otherwise it is <b>TCL_ERROR</b>, and the error message is
    left in the interpreter's result.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TCL_REGISTERCHANNEL"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_REGISTERCHANNEL">TCL_REGISTERCHANNEL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b> adds a channel to the set of channels
    accessible in <i>interp</i>. After this call, Tcl programs executing in that
    interpreter can refer to the channel in input or output operations using the
    name given in the call to <b>Tcl_CreateChannel</b>. After this call, the
    channel becomes the property of the interpreter, and the caller should not
    call <b>Tcl_Close</b> for the channel; the channel will be closed
    automatically when it is unregistered from the interpreter.</p>
<p class="Pp">Code executing outside of any Tcl interpreter can call
    <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b> with <i>interp</i> as NULL, to indicate that it
    wishes to hold a reference to this channel. Subsequently, the channel can be
    registered in a Tcl interpreter and it will only be closed when the matching
    number of calls to <b>Tcl_UnregisterChannel</b> have been made. This allows
    code executing outside of any interpreter to safely hold a reference to a
    channel that is also registered in a Tcl interpreter.</p>
<p class="Pp">This procedure interacts with the code managing the standard
    channels. If no standard channels were initialized before the first call to
    <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b>, they will get initialized by that call. See
    <b>Tcl_StandardChannels</b> for a general treatise about standard channels
    and the behaviour of the Tcl library with regard to them.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_UnregisterChannel</b> removes a channel from the set of
    channels accessible in <i>interp</i>. After this call, Tcl programs will no
    longer be able to use the channel's name to refer to the channel in that
    interpreter. If this operation removed the last registration of the channel
    in any interpreter, the channel is also closed and destroyed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Code not associated with a Tcl interpreter can call
    <b>Tcl_UnregisterChannel</b> with <i>interp</i> as NULL, to indicate to Tcl
    that it no longer holds a reference to that channel. If this is the last
    reference to the channel, it will now be closed.
    <b>Tcl_UnregisterChannel</b> is very similar to <b>Tcl_DetachChannel</b>

<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Close</b> destroys the channel <i>channel</i>, which must
    denote a currently open channel. The channel should not be registered in any
    interpreter when <b>Tcl_Close</b> is called. Buffered output is flushed to
    the channel's output device prior to destroying the channel, and any
    buffered input is discarded. If this is a blocking channel, the call does
    not return until all buffered data is successfully sent to the channel's
    output device. If this is a nonblocking channel and there is buffered output
    that cannot be written without blocking, the call returns immediately;
    output is flushed in the background and the channel will be closed once all
    of the buffered data has been output. In this case errors during flushing
    are not reported.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the channel was closed successfully, <b>Tcl_Close</b> returns
    <b>TCL_OK</b>. If an error occurs, <b>Tcl_Close</b> returns <b>TCL_ERROR</b>
    and records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with
    <b>Tcl_GetErrno</b>. If the channel is being closed synchronously and an
    error occurs during closing of the channel and <i>interp</i> is not NULL, an
    error message is left in the interpreter's result.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: it is not safe to call <b>Tcl_Close</b> on a channel that
    has been registered using <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b>; see the documentation
    for <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b>, above, for details. If the channel has ever
    been given as the <b>chan</b> argument in a call to
    <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b>, you should instead use
    <b>Tcl_UnregisterChannel</b>, which will internally call <b>Tcl_Close</b>
    when all calls to <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b> have been matched by
    corresponding calls to <b>Tcl_UnregisterChannel</b>.</p>

  AND TCL_READ</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ReadChars</b> consumes bytes from <i>channel</i>,
    converting the bytes to UTF-8 based on the channel's encoding and storing
    the produced data in <i>readObjPtr</i>'s string representation. The return
    value of <b>Tcl_ReadChars</b> is the number of characters, up to
    <i>charsToRead</i>, that were stored in <i>readObjPtr</i>. If an error
    occurs while reading, the return value is -1 and <b>Tcl_ReadChars</b>
    records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with
  <b>Tcl_GetErrno</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Setting <i>charsToRead</i> to <b>-1</b> will cause the command to
    read all characters currently available (non-blocking) or everything until
    eof (blocking mode).</p>
<p class="Pp">The return value may be smaller than the value to read, indicating
    that less data than requested was available. This is called a <i>short
    read</i>. In blocking mode, this can only happen on an end-of-file. In
    nonblocking mode, a short read can also occur if there is not enough input
    currently available: <b>Tcl_ReadChars</b> returns a short count rather than
    waiting for more data.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the channel is in blocking mode, a return value of zero
    indicates an end-of-file condition. If the channel is in nonblocking mode, a
    return value of zero indicates either that no input is currently available
    or an end-of-file condition. Use <b>Tcl_Eof</b> and <b>Tcl_InputBlocked</b>
    to tell which of these conditions actually occurred.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ReadChars</b> translates the various end-of-line
    representations into the canonical <b>\n</b> internal representation
    according to the current end-of-line recognition mode. End-of-line
    recognition and the various platform-specific modes are described in the
    manual entry for the Tcl <b>fconfigure</b> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a performance optimization, when reading from a channel with
    the encoding <b>binary</b>, the bytes are not converted to UTF-8 as they are
    read. Instead, they are stored in <i>readObjPtr</i>'s internal
    representation as a byte-array object. The string representation of this
    object will only be constructed if it is needed (e.g., because of a call to
    <b>Tcl_GetStringFromObj</b>). In this way, byte-oriented data can be read
    from a channel, manipulated by calling <b>Tcl_GetByteArrayFromObj</b> and
    related functions, and then written to a channel without the expense of ever
    converting to or from UTF-8.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Read</b> is similar to <b>Tcl_ReadChars</b>, except that it
    does not do encoding conversions, regardless of the channel's encoding. It
    is deprecated and exists for backwards compatibility with
    non-internationalized Tcl extensions. It consumes bytes from <i>channel</i>
    and stores them in <i>readBuf</i>, performing end-of-line translations on
    the way. The return value of <b>Tcl_Read</b> is the number of bytes, up to
    <i>bytesToRead</i>, written in <i>readBuf</i>. The buffer produced by
    <b>Tcl_Read</b> is not null-terminated. Its contents are valid from the
    zeroth position up to and excluding the position indicated by the return
    value.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ReadRaw</b> is the same as <b>Tcl_Read</b> but does not
    compensate for stacking. While <b>Tcl_Read</b> (and the other functions in
    the API) always get their data from the topmost channel in the stack the
    supplied channel is part of, <b>Tcl_ReadRaw</b> does not. Thus this function
    is <b>only</b> usable for transformational channel drivers, i.e. drivers
    used in the middle of a stack of channels, to move data from the channel
    below into the transformation.</p>

  AND TCL_GETS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_GetsObj</b> consumes bytes from <i>channel</i>, converting
    the bytes to UTF-8 based on the channel's encoding, until a full line of
    input has been seen. If the channel's encoding is <b>binary</b>, each byte
    read from the channel is treated as an individual Unicode character. All of
    the characters of the line except for the terminating end-of-line
    character(s) are appended to <i>lineObjPtr</i>'s string representation. The
    end-of-line character(s) are read and discarded.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a line was successfully read, the return value is greater than
    or equal to zero and indicates the number of bytes stored in
    <i>lineObjPtr</i>. If an error occurs, <b>Tcl_GetsObj</b> returns -1 and
    records a POSIX error code that can be retrieved with <b>Tcl_GetErrno</b>.
    <b>Tcl_GetsObj</b> also returns -1 if the end of the file is reached; the
    <b>Tcl_Eof</b> procedure can be used to distinguish an error from an
    end-of-file condition.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the channel is in nonblocking mode, the return value can also
    be -1 if no data was available or the data that was available did not
    contain an end-of-line character. When -1 is returned, the
    <b>Tcl_InputBlocked</b> procedure may be invoked to determine if the channel
    is blocked because of input unavailability.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Gets</b> is the same as <b>Tcl_GetsObj</b> except the
    resulting characters are appended to the dynamic string given by
    <i>lineRead</i> rather than a Tcl object.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Ungets</b> is used to add data to the input queue of a
    channel, at either the head or tail of the queue. The pointer <i>input</i>
    points to the data that is to be added. The length of the input to add is
    given by <i>inputLen</i>. A non-zero value of <i>addAtEnd</i> indicates that
    the data is to be added at the end of queue; otherwise it will be added at
    the head of the queue. If <i>channel</i> has a &#x201C;sticky&#x201D; EOF
    set, no data will be added to the input queue. <b>Tcl_Ungets</b> returns
    <i>inputLen</i> or -1 if an error occurs.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_WriteChars</b> accepts <i>bytesToWrite</i> bytes of
    character data at <i>charBuf</i>. The UTF-8 characters in the buffer are
    converted to the channel's encoding and queued for output to <i>channel</i>.
    If <i>bytesToWrite</i> is negative, <b>Tcl_WriteChars</b> expects
    <i>charBuf</i> to be null-terminated and it outputs everything up to the
    null.</p>
<p class="Pp">Data queued for output may not appear on the output device
    immediately, due to internal buffering. If the data should appear
    immediately, call <b>Tcl_Flush</b> after the call to <b>Tcl_WriteChars</b>,
    or set the <b>-buffering</b> option on the channel to <b>none</b>. If you
    wish the data to appear as soon as a complete line is accepted for output,
    set the <b>-buffering</b> option on the channel to <b>line</b> mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">The return value of <b>Tcl_WriteChars</b> is a count of how many
    bytes were accepted for output to the channel. This is either greater than
    zero to indicate success or -1 to indicate that an error occurred. If an
    error occurs, <b>Tcl_WriteChars</b> records a POSIX error code that may be
    retrieved with <b>Tcl_GetErrno</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Newline characters in the output data are translated to
    platform-specific end-of-line sequences according to the <b>-translation</b>
    option for the channel. This is done even if the channel has no
  encoding.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_WriteObj</b> is similar to <b>Tcl_WriteChars</b> except it
    accepts a Tcl object whose contents will be output to the channel. The UTF-8
    characters in <i>writeObjPtr</i>'s string representation are converted to
    the channel's encoding and queued for output to <i>channel</i>. As a
    performance optimization, when writing to a channel with the encoding
    <b>binary</b>, UTF-8 characters are not converted as they are written.
    Instead, the bytes in <i>writeObjPtr</i>'s internal representation as a
    byte-array object are written to the channel. The byte-array representation
    of the object will be constructed if it is needed. In this way,

<h1 class="Sh" id="TCL_FLUSH"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_FLUSH">TCL_FLUSH</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Flush</b> causes all of the buffered output data for
    <i>channel</i> to be written to its underlying file or device as soon as
    possible. If the channel is in blocking mode, the call does not return until
    all the buffered data has been sent to the channel or some error occurred.
    The call returns immediately if the channel is nonblocking; it starts a
    background flush that will write the buffered data to the channel
    eventually, as fast as the channel is able to absorb it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The return value is normally <b>TCL_OK</b>. If an error occurs,

<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_GetChannelOption</b> retrieves, in <i>optionValue</i>, the
    value of one of the options currently in effect for a channel, or a list of

    <i>optionValue</i>. If <i>optionName</i> is NULL, the function stores an
    alternating list of option names and their values in <i>optionValue</i>,
    using a series of calls to <b>Tcl_DStringAppendElement</b>. The various
