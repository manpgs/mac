   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b> defines a new command in <i>interp</i>
    and associates it with procedure <i>proc</i> such that whenever
    <i>cmdName</i> is invoked as a Tcl command (via a call to <b>Tcl_Eval</b>)
    the Tcl interpreter will call <i>proc</i> to process the command. It differs
    from <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b> in that a new string-based command is
    defined; that is, a command procedure is defined that takes an array of
    argument strings instead of objects. The object-based command procedures
    registered by <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b> can execute significantly faster
    than the string-based command procedures defined by
    <b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b>. This is because they take Tcl objects as arguments
    and those objects can retain an internal representation that can be
    manipulated more efficiently. Also, Tcl's interpreter now uses objects
    internally. In order to invoke a string-based command procedure registered
    by <b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b>, it must generate and fetch a string
    representation from each argument object before the call and create a new
    Tcl object to hold the string result returned by the string-based command
    procedure. New commands should be defined using <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b>.
    We support <b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b> for backwards compatibility.</p>
<p class="Pp">The procedures <b>Tcl_DeleteCommand</b>,
    <b>Tcl_GetCommandInfo</b>, and <b>Tcl_SetCommandInfo</b> are used in
    conjunction with <b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b> will delete an existing command
    <i>cmdName</i>, if one is already associated with the interpreter. It
    returns a token that may be used to refer to the command in subsequent calls
    to <b>Tcl_GetCommandName</b>. If <i>cmdName</i> contains any <b>::</b>
    namespace qualifiers, then the command is added to the specified namespace;
    otherwise the command is added to the global namespace. If
    <b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b> is called for an interpreter that is in the process
    of being deleted, then it does not create a new command and it returns NULL.
    <i>Proc</i> should have arguments and result that match the type
    <b>Tcl_CmdProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef int Tcl_CmdProc(
<br/>
        ClientData <i>clientData</i>,
<br/>
        Tcl_Interp *<i>interp</i>,
<br/>
        int <i>argc</i>,
<br/>
        const char *<i>argv</i>[]);
</pre>
</div>
When <i>proc</i> is invoked the <i>clientData</i> and <i>interp</i> parameters
  will be copies of the <i>clientData</i> and <i>interp</i> arguments given to
  <b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b>. Typically, <i>clientData</i> points to an
  application-specific data structure that describes what to do when the command
  procedure is invoked. <i>Argc</i> and <i>argv</i> describe the arguments to
  the command, <i>argc</i> giving the number of arguments (including the command
  name) and <i>argv</i> giving the values of the arguments as strings. The
  <i>argv</i> array will contain <i>argc</i>+1 values; the first <i>argc</i>
  values point to the argument strings, and the last value is NULL. Note that
  the argument strings should not be modified as they may point to constant
  strings or may be shared with other parts of the interpreter.
<p class="Pp">Note that the argument strings are encoded in normalized UTF-8
    since version 8.1 of Tcl.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Proc</i> must return an integer code that is expected to be one
    of <b>TCL_OK</b>, <b>TCL_ERROR</b>, <b>TCL_RETURN</b>, <b>TCL_BREAK</b>, or
    <b>TCL_CONTINUE</b>. See the Tcl overview man page for details on what these
    codes mean. Most normal commands will only return <b>TCL_OK</b> or
    <b>TCL_ERROR</b>. In addition, <i>proc</i> must set the interpreter result
    to point to a string value; in the case of a <b>TCL_OK</b> return code this
    gives the result of the command, and in the case of <b>TCL_ERROR</b> it
    gives an error message. The <b>Tcl_SetResult</b> procedure provides an easy
    interface for setting the return value; for complete details on how the
    interpreter result field is managed, see the <b>Tcl_Interp</b> man page.
    Before invoking a command procedure, <b>Tcl_Eval</b> sets the interpreter
    result to point to an empty string, so simple commands can return an empty
    result by doing nothing at all.</p>
<p class="Pp">The contents of the <i>argv</i> array belong to Tcl and are not
    guaranteed to persist once <i>proc</i> returns: <i>proc</i> should not
    modify them, nor should it set the interpreter result to point anywhere
    within the <i>argv</i> values. Call <b>Tcl_SetResult</b> with status
    <b>TCL_VOLATILE</b> if you want to return something from the <i>argv</i>
    array.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>DeleteProc</i> will be invoked when (if) <i>cmdName</i> is
    deleted. This can occur through a call to <b>Tcl_DeleteCommand</b> or
    <b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b>, or by replacing <i>cmdName</i> in another call to
    <b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b>. <i>DeleteProc</i> is invoked before the command is
    deleted, and gives the application an opportunity to release any structures
    associated with the command. <i>DeleteProc</i> should have arguments and
    result that match the type <b>Tcl_CmdDeleteProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef void Tcl_CmdDeleteProc(
<br/>
        ClientData <i>clientData</i>);
</pre>
</div>
The <i>clientData</i> argument will be the same as the <i>clientData</i>
  argument passed to <b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b>.
