   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b> defines a new command in <i>interp</i>
    and associates it with procedure <i>proc</i> such that whenever <i>name</i>
    is invoked as a Tcl command (e.g., via a call to <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b>) the
    Tcl interpreter will call <i>proc</i> to process the command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b> deletes any existing command
    <i>name</i> already associated with the interpreter (however see below for
    an exception where the existing command is not deleted). It returns a token
    that may be used to refer to the command in subsequent calls to
    <b>Tcl_GetCommandName</b>. If <i>name</i> contains any <b>::</b> namespace
    qualifiers, then the command is added to the specified namespace; otherwise
    the command is added to the global namespace. If <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b>
    is called for an interpreter that is in the process of being deleted, then
    it does not create a new command and it returns NULL. <i>proc</i> should
    have arguments and result that match the type <b>Tcl_ObjCmdProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef int Tcl_ObjCmdProc(
        ClientData <i>clientData</i>,
        Tcl_Interp *<i>interp</i>,
        int <i>objc</i>,
        Tcl_Obj *const <i>objv</i>[]);</pre>
</div>
When <i>proc</i> is invoked, the <i>clientData</i> and <i>interp</i> parameters
  will be copies of the <i>clientData</i> and <i>interp</i> arguments given to
  <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b>. Typically, <i>clientData</i> points to an
  application-specific data structure that describes what to do when the command
  procedure is invoked. <i>Objc</i> and <i>objv</i> describe the arguments to
  the command, <i>objc</i> giving the number of argument objects (including the
  command name) and <i>objv</i> giving the values of the arguments. The
  <i>objv</i> array will contain <i>objc</i> values, pointing to the argument
  objects. Unlike <i>argv</i>[<i>argv</i>] used in a string-based command
  procedure, <i>objv</i>[<i>objc</i>] will not contain NULL.
<p class="Pp">Additionally, when <i>proc</i> is invoked, it must not modify the
    contents of the <i>objv</i> array by assigning new pointer values to any
    element of the array (for example, <i>objv</i>[<b>2</b>] = <b>NULL</b>)
    because this will cause memory to be lost and the runtime stack to be
    corrupted. The <b>const</b> in the declaration of <i>objv</i> will cause
    ANSI-compliant compilers to report any such attempted assignment as an
    error. However, it is acceptable to modify the internal representation of
    any individual object argument. For instance, the user may call
    <b>Tcl_GetIntFromObj</b> on <i>objv</i>[<b>2</b>] to obtain the integer
    representation of that object; that call may change the type of the object
    that <i>objv</i>[<b>2</b>] points at, but will not change where
    <i>objv</i>[<b>2</b>] points.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>proc</i> must return an integer code that is either
    <b>TCL_OK</b>, <b>TCL_ERROR</b>, <b>TCL_RETURN</b>, <b>TCL_BREAK</b>, or
    <b>TCL_CONTINUE</b>. See the Tcl overview man page for details on what these
    codes mean. Most normal commands will only return <b>TCL_OK</b> or
    <b>TCL_ERROR</b>. In addition, if <i>proc</i> needs to return a non-empty
    result, it can call <b>Tcl_SetObjResult</b> to set the interpreter's result.
    In the case of a <b>TCL_OK</b> return code this gives the result of the
    command, and in the case of <b>TCL_ERROR</b> this gives an error message.
    Before invoking a command procedure, <b>Tcl_EvalObjEx</b> sets interpreter's
    result to point to an object representing an empty string, so simple
    commands can return an empty result by doing nothing at all.</p>
<p class="Pp">The contents of the <i>objv</i> array belong to Tcl and are not
    guaranteed to persist once <i>proc</i> returns: <i>proc</i> should not
    modify them. Call <b>Tcl_SetObjResult</b> if you want to return something
    from the <i>objv</i> array.</p>
<p class="Pp">Ordinarily, <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b> deletes any existing
    command <i>name</i> already associated with the interpreter. However, if the
    existing command was created by a previous call to <b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b>,
    <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b> does not delete the command but instead arranges
    for the Tcl interpreter to call the <b>Tcl_ObjCmdProc</b> <i>proc</i> in the
    future. The old string-based <b>Tcl_CmdProc</b> associated with the command
    is retained and its address can be obtained by subsequent
    <b>Tcl_GetCommandInfo</b> calls. This is done for backwards
  compatibility.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>DeleteProc</i> will be invoked when (if) <i>name</i> is
    deleted. This can occur through a call to <b>Tcl_DeleteCommand</b>,
    <b>Tcl_DeleteCommandFromToken</b>, or <b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b>, or by
    replacing <i>name</i> in another call to <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b>.
    <i>DeleteProc</i> is invoked before the command is deleted, and gives the
    application an opportunity to release any structures associated with the
    command. <i>DeleteProc</i> should have arguments and result that match the
    type <b>Tcl_CmdDeleteProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef void Tcl_CmdDeleteProc(
        ClientData <i>clientData</i>);</pre>
</div>
The <i>clientData</i> argument will be the same as the <i>clientData</i>
  argument passed to <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b>.
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DeleteCommand</b> deletes a command from a command
    interpreter. Once the call completes, attempts to invoke <i>cmdName</i> in
    <i>interp</i> will result in errors. If <i>cmdName</i> is not bound as a
    command in <i>interp</i> then <b>Tcl_DeleteCommand</b> does nothing and
    returns -1; otherwise it returns 0. There are no restrictions on
    <i>cmdName</i>: it may refer to a built-in command, an application-specific
    command, or a Tcl procedure. If <i>name</i> contains any <b>::</b> namespace
    qualifiers, the command is deleted from the specified namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">Given a token returned by <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b>,
    <b>Tcl_DeleteCommandFromToken</b> deletes the command from a command
    interpreter. It will delete a command even if that command has been renamed.
    Once the call completes, attempts to invoke the command in <i>interp</i>
    will result in errors. If the command corresponding to <i>token</i> has
    already been deleted from <i>interp</i> then <b>Tcl_DeleteCommand</b> does
    nothing and returns -1; otherwise it returns 0.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_GetCommandInfo</b> checks to see whether its <i>cmdName</i>
    argument exists as a command in <i>interp</i>. <i>cmdName</i> may include
    <b>::</b> namespace qualifiers to identify a command in a particular
    namespace. If the command is not found, then it returns 0. Otherwise it
    places information about the command in the <b>Tcl_CmdInfo</b> structure
    pointed to by <i>infoPtr</i> and returns 1. A <b>Tcl_CmdInfo</b> structure
    has the following fields:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef struct Tcl_CmdInfo {
    int <i>isNativeObjectProc</i>;
    Tcl_ObjCmdProc *<i>objProc</i>;
    ClientData <i>objClientData</i>;
    Tcl_CmdProc *<i>proc</i>;
    ClientData <i>clientData</i>;
    Tcl_CmdDeleteProc *<i>deleteProc</i>;
    ClientData <i>deleteData</i>;
    Tcl_Namespace *<i>namespacePtr</i>;
} Tcl_CmdInfo;</pre>
</div>
The <i>isNativeObjectProc</i> field has the value 1 if
  <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b> was called to register the command; it is 0 if
  only <b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b> was called. It allows a program to determine
  whether it is faster to call <i>objProc</i> or <i>proc</i>: <i>objProc</i> is
  normally faster if <i>isNativeObjectProc</i> has the value 1. The fields
  <i>objProc</i> and <i>objClientData</i> have the same meaning as the
  <i>proc</i> and <i>clientData</i> arguments to <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b>;
  they hold information about the object-based command procedure that the Tcl
  interpreter calls to implement the command. The fields <i>proc</i> and
  <i>clientData</i> hold information about the string-based command procedure
  that implements the command. If <b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b> was called for this
  command, this is the procedure passed to it; otherwise, this is a
  compatibility procedure registered by <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b> that simply
  calls the command's object-based procedure after converting its string
  arguments to Tcl objects. The field <i>deleteData</i> is the ClientData value
  to pass to <i>deleteProc</i>; it is normally the same as <i>clientData</i> but
  may be set independently using the <b>Tcl_SetCommandInfo</b> procedure. The
  field <i>namespacePtr</i> holds a pointer to the Tcl_Namespace that contains
  the command.
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_GetCommandInfoFromToken</b> is identical to
    <b>Tcl_GetCommandInfo</b> except that it uses a command token returned from
    <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b> in place of the command name. If the
    <i>token</i> parameter is NULL, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns 1 and
    fills in the structure designated by <i>infoPtr</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_SetCommandInfo</b> is used to modify the procedures and
    ClientData values associated with a command. Its <i>cmdName</i> argument is
    the name of a command in <i>interp</i>. <i>cmdName</i> may include <b>::</b>
    namespace qualifiers to identify a command in a particular namespace. If
    this command does not exist then <b>Tcl_SetCommandInfo</b> returns 0.
    Otherwise, it copies the information from <i>*infoPtr</i> to Tcl's internal
    structure for the command and returns 1.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_SetCommandInfoFromToken</b> is identical to
    <b>Tcl_SetCommandInfo</b> except that it takes a command token as returned
    by <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b> instead of the command name. If the
    <i>token</i> parameter is NULL, it returns 0. Otherwise, it copies the
    information from <i>*infoPtr</i> to Tcl's internal structure for the command
    and returns 1.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that <b>Tcl_SetCommandInfo</b> and
    <b>Tcl_SetCommandInfoFromToken</b> both allow the ClientData for a command's
    deletion procedure to be given a different value than the ClientData for its
    command procedure.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that neither <b>Tcl_SetCommandInfo</b> nor
    <b>Tcl_SetCommandInfoFromToken</b> will change a command's namespace. Use
    <b>Tcl_Eval</b> to call the <b>rename</b> command to do that.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_GetCommandName</b> provides a mechanism for tracking
    commands that have been renamed. Given a token returned by
    <b>Tcl_CreateObjCommand</b> when the command was created,
    <b>Tcl_GetCommandName</b> returns the string name of the command. If the
    command has been renamed since it was created, then
    <b>Tcl_GetCommandName</b> returns the current name. This name does not
    include any <b>::</b> namespace qualifiers. The command corresponding to
    <i>token</i> must not have been deleted. The string returned by
    <b>Tcl_GetCommandName</b> is in dynamic memory owned by Tcl and is only
    guaranteed to retain its value as long as the command is not deleted or
    renamed; callers should copy the string if they need to keep it for a long
    time.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_GetCommandFullName</b> produces the fully qualified name of
    a command from a command token. The name, including all namespace prefixes,
    is appended to the object specified by <i>objPtr</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_GetCommandFromObj</b> returns a token for the command
    specified by the name in a <b>Tcl_Obj</b>. The command name is resolved
    relative to the current namespace. Returns NULL if the command is not
  found.</p>
