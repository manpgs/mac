   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">These procedures may be used to disassemble and reassemble Tcl
    lists. <b>Tcl_SplitList</b> breaks a list up into its constituent elements,
    returning an array of pointers to the elements using <i>argcPtr</i> and
    <i>argvPtr</i>. While extracting the arguments, <b>Tcl_SplitList</b> obeys
    the usual rules for backslash substitutions and braces. The area of memory
    pointed to by <i>*argvPtr</i> is dynamically allocated; in addition to the
    array of pointers, it also holds copies of all the list elements. It is the
    caller's responsibility to free up all of this storage. For example, suppose
    that you have called <b>Tcl_SplitList</b> with the following code:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
int argc, code;
char *string;
char **argv;
...
code = Tcl_SplitList(interp, string, &amp;argc, &amp;argv);</pre>
</div>
Then you should eventually free the storage with a call like the following:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
Tcl_Free((char *) argv);</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_SplitList</b> normally returns <b>TCL_OK</b>, which means
    the list was successfully parsed. If there was a syntax error in
    <i>list</i>, then <b>TCL_ERROR</b> is returned and the interpreter's result
    will point to an error message describing the problem (if <i>interp</i> was
    not NULL). If <b>TCL_ERROR</b> is returned then no memory is allocated and
    <i>*argvPtr</i> is not modified.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Merge</b> is the inverse of <b>Tcl_SplitList</b>: it takes
    a collection of strings given by <i>argc</i> and <i>argv</i> and generates a
    result string that has proper list structure. This means that commands like
    <b>index</b> may be used to extract the original elements again. In
    addition, if the result of <b>Tcl_Merge</b> is passed to <b>Tcl_Eval</b>, it
    will be parsed into <i>argc</i> words whose values will be the same as the
    <i>argv</i> strings passed to <b>Tcl_Merge</b>. <b>Tcl_Merge</b> will modify
    the list elements with braces and/or backslashes in order to produce proper
    Tcl list structure. The result string is dynamically allocated using
    <b>Tcl_Alloc</b>; the caller must eventually release the space using
    <b>Tcl_Free</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the result of <b>Tcl_Merge</b> is passed to
    <b>Tcl_SplitList</b>, the elements returned by <b>Tcl_SplitList</b> will be
    identical to those passed into <b>Tcl_Merge</b>. However, the converse is
    not true: if <b>Tcl_SplitList</b> is passed a given string, and the
    resulting <i>argc</i> and <i>argv</i> are passed to <b>Tcl_Merge</b>, the
    resulting string may not be the same as the original string passed to
    <b>Tcl_SplitList</b>. This is because <b>Tcl_Merge</b> may use backslashes
    and braces differently than the original string.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ScanElement</b> and <b>Tcl_ConvertElement</b> are the
    procedures that do all of the real work of <b>Tcl_Merge</b>.
    <b>Tcl_ScanElement</b> scans its <i>src</i> argument and determines how to
    use backslashes and braces when converting it to a list element. It returns
    an overestimate of the number of characters required to represent <i>src</i>
    as a list element, and it stores information in <i>*flagsPtr</i> that is
    needed by <b>Tcl_ConvertElement</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ConvertElement</b> is a companion procedure to
    <b>Tcl_ScanElement</b>. It does the actual work of converting a string to a
    list element. Its <i>flags</i> argument must be the same as the value
    returned by <b>Tcl_ScanElement</b>. <b>Tcl_ConvertElement</b> writes a
    proper list element to memory starting at *<i>dst</i> and returns a count of
    the total number of characters written, which will be no more than the
    result returned by <b>Tcl_ScanElement</b>. <b>Tcl_ConvertElement</b> writes
    out only the actual list element without any leading or trailing spaces: it
    is up to the caller to include spaces between adjacent list elements.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ConvertElement</b> uses one of two different approaches to
    handle the special characters in <i>src</i>. Wherever possible, it handles
    special characters by surrounding the string with braces. This produces
    clean-looking output, but cannot be used in some situations, such as when
    <i>src</i> contains unmatched braces. In these situations,
    <b>Tcl_ConvertElement</b> handles special characters by generating backslash
    sequences for them. The caller may insist on the second approach by OR-ing
    the flag value returned by <b>Tcl_ScanElement</b> with
    <b>TCL_DONT_USE_BRACES</b>. Although this will produce an uglier result, it
    is useful in some special situations, such as when <b>Tcl_ConvertElement</b>
    is being used to generate a portion of an argument for a Tcl command. In
    this case, surrounding <i>src</i> with curly braces would cause the command
    not to be parsed correctly.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, <b>Tcl_ConvertElement</b> will use quoting in its
    output to be sure the first character of an element is not the hash
    character (&#x201C;#&#x201D;.) This is to be sure the first element of any
    list passed to <b>eval</b> is not mis-parsed as the beginning of a comment.
    When a list element is not the first element of a list, this quoting is not
    necessary. When the caller can be sure that the element is not the first
    element of a list, it can disable quoting of the leading hash character by
    OR-ing the flag value returned by <b>Tcl_ScanElement</b> with
    <b>TCL_DONT_QUOTE_HASH</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ScanCountedElement</b> and <b>Tcl_ConvertCountedElement</b>
    are the same as <b>Tcl_ScanElement</b> and <b>Tcl_ConvertElement</b>, except
    the length of string <i>src</i> is specified by the <i>length</i> argument,
    and the string may contain embedded nulls.</p>
