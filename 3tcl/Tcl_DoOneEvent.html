   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">This procedure is the entry point to Tcl's event loop; it is
    responsible for waiting for events and dispatching event handlers created
    with procedures such as <b>Tk_CreateEventHandler</b>,
    <b>Tcl_CreateFileHandler</b>, <b>Tcl_CreateTimerHandler</b>, and
    <b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b>. <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> checks to see if events are
    already present on the Tcl event queue; if so, it calls the handler(s) for
    the first (oldest) event, removes it from the queue, and returns. If there
    are no events ready to be handled, then <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> checks for new
    events from all possible sources. If any are found, it puts all of them on
    Tcl's event queue, calls handlers for the first event on the queue, and
    returns. If no events are found, <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> checks for
    <b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b> callbacks; if any are found, it invokes all of them
    and returns. Finally, if no events or idle callbacks have been found, then
    <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> sleeps until an event occurs; then it adds any new
    events to the Tcl event queue, calls handlers for the first event, and
    returns. The normal return value is 1 to signify that some event was
    processed (see below for other alternatives).</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>flags</i> argument to <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> is non-zero,
    it restricts the kinds of events that will be processed by
    <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>. <i>Flags</i> may be an OR-ed combination of any of
    the following bits:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="TCL_WINDOW_EVENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_WINDOW_EVENTS"><b>TCL_WINDOW_EVENTS</b>
    -</a></dt>
  <dd>Process window system events.</dd>
  <dt id="TCL_FILE_EVENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_FILE_EVENTS"><b>TCL_FILE_EVENTS</b>
    -</a></dt>
  <dd>Process file events.</dd>
  <dt id="TCL_TIMER_EVENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_TIMER_EVENTS"><b>TCL_TIMER_EVENTS</b>
    -</a></dt>
  <dd>Process timer events.</dd>
  <dt id="TCL_IDLE_EVENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_IDLE_EVENTS"><b>TCL_IDLE_EVENTS</b>
    -</a></dt>
  <dd>Process idle callbacks.</dd>
  <dt id="TCL_ALL_EVENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_ALL_EVENTS"><b>TCL_ALL_EVENTS</b>
    -</a></dt>
  <dd>Process all kinds of events: equivalent to OR-ing together all of the
      above flags or specifying none of them.</dd>
  <dt id="TCL_DONT_WAIT"><a class="permalink" href="#TCL_DONT_WAIT"><b>TCL_DONT_WAIT</b>
    -</a></dt>
  <dd>Do not sleep: process only events that are ready at the time of the
    call.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If any of the flags <b>TCL_WINDOW_EVENTS</b>,
    <b>TCL_FILE_EVENTS</b>, <b>TCL_TIMER_EVENTS</b>, or <b>TCL_IDLE_EVENTS</b>
    is set, then the only events that will be considered are those for which
    flags are set. Setting none of these flags is equivalent to the value
    <b>TCL_ALL_EVENTS</b>, which causes all event types to be processed. If an
    application has defined additional event sources with
    <b>Tcl_CreateEventSource</b>, then additional <i>flag</i> values may also be
    valid, depending on those event sources.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>TCL_DONT_WAIT</b> flag causes <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> not to
    put the process to sleep: it will check for events but if none are found
    then it returns immediately with a return value of 0 to indicate that no
    work was done. <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> will also return 0 without doing
    anything if the only alternative is to block forever (this can happen, for
    example, if <i>flags</i> is <b>TCL_IDLE_EVENTS</b> and there are no
    <b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b> callbacks pending, or if no event handlers or timer
    handlers exist).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> may be invoked recursively. For example, it
    is possible to invoke <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> recursively from a handler
    called by <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b>. This sort of operation is useful in some
    modal situations, such as when a notification dialog has been popped up and
    an application wishes to wait for the user to click a button in the dialog
    before doing anything else.</p>
