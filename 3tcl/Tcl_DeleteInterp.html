   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_CreateInterp</b> creates a new interpreter structure and
    returns a token for it. The token is required in calls to most other Tcl
    procedures, such as <b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b>, <b>Tcl_Eval</b>, and
    <b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b>. Clients are only allowed to access a few of the
    fields of Tcl_Interp structures; see the <b>Tcl_Interp</b> and
    <b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b> man pages for details. The new interpreter is
    initialized with the built-in Tcl commands and with the variables documented
    in tclvars(n). To bind in additional commands, call
    <b>Tcl_CreateCommand</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b> marks an interpreter as deleted; the
    interpreter will eventually be deleted when all calls to <b>Tcl_Preserve</b>
    for it have been matched by calls to <b>Tcl_Release</b>. At that time, all
    of the resources associated with it, including variables, procedures, and
    application-specific command bindings, will be deleted. After
    <b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b> returns any attempt to use <b>Tcl_Eval</b> on the
    interpreter will fail and return <b>TCL_ERROR</b>. After the call to
    <b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b> it is safe to examine the interpreter's result,
    query or set the values of variables, define, undefine or retrieve
    procedures, and examine the runtime evaluation stack. See below, in the
    section <b>INTERPRETERS AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT</b> for details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_InterpDeleted</b> returns nonzero if
    <b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b> was called with <i>interp</i> as its argument; this
    indicates that the interpreter will eventually be deleted, when the last
    call to <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> for it is matched by a call to
    <b>Tcl_Release</b>. If nonzero is returned, further calls to <b>Tcl_Eval</b>
    in this interpreter will return <b>TCL_ERROR</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_InterpDeleted</b> is useful in deletion callbacks to
    distinguish between when only the memory the callback is responsible for is
    being deleted and when the whole interpreter is being deleted. In the former
    case the callback may recreate the data being deleted, but this would lead
    to an infinite loop if the interpreter were being deleted.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="INTERPRETERS_AND_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#INTERPRETERS_AND_MEMORY_MANAGEMENT">INTERPRETERS
  AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b> can be called at any time on an
    interpreter that may be used by nested evaluations and C code in various
    extensions. Tcl implements a simple mechanism that allows callers to use
    interpreters without worrying about the interpreter being deleted in a
    nested call, and without requiring special code to protect the interpreter,
    in most cases. This mechanism ensures that nested uses of an interpreter can
    safely continue using it even after <b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b> is called.</p>
<p class="Pp">The mechanism relies on matching up calls to <b>Tcl_Preserve</b>
    with calls to <b>Tcl_Release</b>. If <b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b> has been
    called, only when the last call to <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> is matched by a call
    to <b>Tcl_Release</b>, will the interpreter be freed. See the manual entry
    for <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> for a description of these functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The rules for when the user of an interpreter must call
    <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> and <b>Tcl_Release</b> are simple:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Interpreters"><a class="permalink" href="#Interpreters">Interpreters
    Passed As Arguments</a></dt>
  <dd>Functions that are passed an interpreter as an argument can safely use the
      interpreter without any special protection. Thus, when you write an
      extension consisting of new Tcl commands, no special code is needed to
      protect interpreters received as arguments. This covers the majority of
      all uses.</dd>
  <dt id="Interpreter"><a class="permalink" href="#Interpreter">Interpreter
    Creation And Deletion</a></dt>
  <dd>When a new interpreter is created and used in a call to <b>Tcl_Eval</b>,
      <b>Tcl_VarEval</b>, <b>Tcl_GlobalEval</b>, <b>Tcl_SetVar</b>, or
      <b>Tcl_GetVar</b>, a pair of calls to <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> and
      <b>Tcl_Release</b> should be wrapped around all uses of the interpreter.
      Remember that it is unsafe to use the interpreter once <b>Tcl_Release</b>
      has been called. To ensure that the interpreter is properly deleted when
      it is no longer needed, call <b>Tcl_InterpDeleted</b> to test if some
      other code already called <b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b>; if not, call
      <b>Tcl_DeleteInterp</b> before calling <b>Tcl_Release</b> in your own
      code.</dd>
  <dt id="Retrieving"><a class="permalink" href="#Retrieving">Retrieving An
    Interpreter From A Data Structure</a></dt>
  <dd>When an interpreter is retrieved from a data structure (e.g. the client
      data of a callback) for use in <b>Tcl_Eval</b>, <b>Tcl_VarEval</b>,
      <b>Tcl_GlobalEval</b>, <b>Tcl_SetVar</b>, or <b>Tcl_GetVar</b>, a pair of
      calls to <b>Tcl_Preserve</b> and <b>Tcl_Release</b> should be wrapped
      around all uses of the interpreter; it is unsafe to reuse the interpreter
      once <b>Tcl_Release</b> has been called. If an interpreter is stored
      inside a callback data structure, an appropriate deletion cleanup
      mechanism should be set up by the code that creates the data structure so
      that the interpreter is removed from the data structure (e.g. by setting
      the field to NULL) when the interpreter is deleted. Otherwise, you may be
      using an interpreter that has been freed and whose memory may already have
      been reused.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">All uses of interpreters in Tcl and Tk have already been
    protected. Extension writers should ensure that their code also properly
    protects any additional interpreters used, as described above.</p>
