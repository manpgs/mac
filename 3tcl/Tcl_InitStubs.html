   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">The Tcl stubs mechanism defines a way to dynamically bind
    extensions to a particular Tcl implementation at run time. This provides two
    significant benefits to Tcl users:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1)</dt>
  <dd>Extensions that use the stubs mechanism can be loaded into multiple
      versions of Tcl without being recompiled or relinked.</dd>
  <dt>2)</dt>
  <dd>Extensions that use the stubs mechanism can be dynamically loaded into
      statically-linked Tcl applications.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The stubs mechanism accomplishes this by exporting function tables
    that define an interface to the Tcl API. The extension then accesses the Tcl
    API through offsets into the function table, so there are no direct
    references to any of the Tcl library's symbols. This redirection is
    transparent to the extension, so an extension writer can continue to use all
    public Tcl functions as documented.</p>
<p class="Pp">The stubs mechanism requires no changes to applications
    incorporating Tcl interpreters. Only developers creating C-based Tcl
    extensions need to take steps to use the stubs mechanism with their
    extensions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Enabling the stubs mechanism for an extension requires the
    following steps:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1)</dt>
  <dd>Call <b>Tcl_InitStubs</b> in the extension before calling any other Tcl
      functions.</dd>
  <dt>2)</dt>
  <dd>Define the <b>USE_TCL_STUBS</b> symbol. Typically, you would include the
      <b>-DUSE_TCL_STUBS</b> flag when compiling the extension.</dd>
  <dt>3)</dt>
  <dd>Link the extension with the Tcl stubs library instead of the standard Tcl
      library. On Unix platforms, the library name is <i>libtclstub8.1.a</i>; on
      Windows platforms, the library name is <i>tclstub81.lib</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If the extension also requires the Tk API, it must also call
    <b>Tk_InitStubs</b> to initialize the Tk stubs interface and link with the
    Tk stubs libraries. See the <b>Tk_InitStubs</b> page for more
  information.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_InitStubs</b> attempts to initialize the stub table
    pointers and ensure that the correct version of Tcl is loaded. In addition
    to an interpreter handle, it accepts as arguments a version number and a
    Boolean flag indicating whether the extension requires an exact version
    match or not. If <i>exact</i> is 0, then the extension is indicating that
    newer versions of Tcl are acceptable as long as they have the same major
    version number as <i>version</i>; non-zero means that only the specified
    <i>version</i> is acceptable. <b>Tcl_InitStubs</b> returns a string
    containing the actual version of Tcl satisfying the request, or NULL if the
    Tcl version is not acceptable, does not support stubs, or any other error
    condition occurred.</p>
