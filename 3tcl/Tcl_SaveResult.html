   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">These routines allows a C procedure to take a snapshot of the
    current state of an interpreter so that it can be restored after a call to
    <b>Tcl_Eval</b> or some other routine that modifies the interpreter state.
    There are two triplets of routines meant to work together.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first triplet stores the snapshot of interpreter state in an
    opaque token returned by <b>Tcl_SaveInterpState</b>. That token value may
    then be passed back to one of <b>Tcl_RestoreInterpState</b> or
    <b>Tcl_DiscardInterpState</b>, depending on whether the interp state is to
    be restored. So long as one of the latter two routines is called, Tcl will
    take care of memory management.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second triplet stores the snapshot of only the interpreter
    result (not its complete state) in memory allocated by the caller. These
    routines are passed a pointer to a <b>Tcl_SavedResult</b> structure that is
    used to store enough information to restore the interpreter result. This
    structure can be allocated on the stack of the calling procedure. These
    routines do not save the state of any error information in the interpreter
    (e.g. the <b>-errorcode</b> or <b>-errorinfo</b> return options, when an
    error is in progress).</p>
<p class="Pp">Because the routines <b>Tcl_SaveInterpState</b>,
    <b>Tcl_RestoreInterpState</b>, and <b>Tcl_DiscardInterpState</b> perform a
    superset of the functions provided by the other routines, any new code
    should only make use of the more powerful routines. The older, weaker
    routines <b>Tcl_SaveResult</b>, <b>Tcl_RestoreResult</b>, and
    <b>Tcl_DiscardResult</b> continue to exist only for the sake of existing
    programs that may already be using them.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_SaveInterpState</b> takes a snapshot of those portions of
    interpreter state that make up the full result of script evaluation. This
    include the interpreter result, the return code (passed in as the
    <i>status</i> argument, and any return options, including <b>-errorinfo</b>
    and <b>-errorcode</b> when an error is in progress. This snapshot is
    returned as an opaque token of type <b>Tcl_InterpState</b>. The call to
    <b>Tcl_SaveInterpState</b> does not itself change the state of the
    interpreter. Unlike <b>Tcl_SaveResult</b>, it does not reset the
    interpreter.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_RestoreInterpState</b> accepts a <b>Tcl_InterpState</b>
    token previously returned by <b>Tcl_SaveInterpState</b> and restores the
    state of the interp to the state held in that snapshot. The return value of
    <b>Tcl_RestoreInterpState</b> is the status value originally passed to
    <b>Tcl_SaveInterpState</b> when the snapshot token was created.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DiscardInterpState</b> is called to release a
    <b>Tcl_InterpState</b> token previously returned by
    <b>Tcl_SaveInterpState</b> when that snapshot is not to be restored to an
    interp.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>Tcl_InterpState</b> token returned by
    <b>Tcl_SaveInterpState</b> must eventually be passed to either
    <b>Tcl_RestoreInterpState</b> or <b>Tcl_DiscardInterpState</b> to avoid a
    memory leak. Once the <b>Tcl_InterpState</b> token is passed to one of them,
    the token is no longer valid and should not be used anymore.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_SaveResult</b> moves the string and object results of
    <i>interp</i> into the location specified by <i>statePtr</i>.
    <b>Tcl_SaveResult</b> clears the result for <i>interp</i> and leaves the
    result in its normal empty initialized state.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_RestoreResult</b> moves the string and object results from
    <i>statePtr</i> back into <i>interp</i>. Any result or error that was
    already in the interpreter will be cleared. The <i>statePtr</i> is left in
    an uninitialized state and cannot be used until another call to
    <b>Tcl_SaveResult</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DiscardResult</b> releases the saved interpreter state
    stored at <b>statePtr</b>. The state structure is left in an uninitialized
    state and cannot be used until another call to <b>Tcl_SaveResult</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once <b>Tcl_SaveResult</b> is called to save the interpreter
    result, either <b>Tcl_RestoreResult</b> or <b>Tcl_DiscardResult</b> must be
    called to properly clean up the memory associated with the saved state.</p>
