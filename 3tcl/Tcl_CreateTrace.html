   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_CreateObjTrace</b> arranges for command tracing. After it
    is called, <i>objProc</i> will be invoked before the Tcl interpreter calls
    any command procedure when evaluating commands in <i>interp</i>. The return
    value from <b>Tcl_CreateObjTrace</b> is a token for the trace, which may be
    passed to <b>Tcl_DeleteTrace</b> to remove the trace. There may be many
    traces in effect simultaneously for the same interpreter.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>objProc</i> should have arguments and result that match the
    type, <b>Tcl_CmdObjTraceProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef int <b>Tcl_CmdObjTraceProc</b>( 
        <b>ClientData</b> <i>clientData</i>,
        <b>Tcl_Interp</b>* <i>interp</i>,
        int <i>level</i>,
        const char *<i>command</i>,
        <b>Tcl_Command</b> <i>commandToken</i>,
        int <i>objc</i>,
        <b>Tcl_Obj</b> *const <i>objv</i>[] );</pre>
</div>
The <i>clientData</i> and <i>interp</i> parameters are copies of the
  corresponding arguments given to <b>Tcl_CreateTrace</b>. <i>ClientData</i>
  typically points to an application-specific data structure that describes what
  to do when <i>objProc</i> is invoked. The <i>level</i> parameter gives the
  nesting level of the command (1 for top-level commands passed to
  <b>Tcl_Eval</b> by the application, 2 for the next-level commands passed to
  <b>Tcl_Eval</b> as part of parsing or interpreting level-1 commands, and so
  on). The <i>command</i> parameter points to a string containing the text of
  the command, before any argument substitution. The <i>commandToken</i>
  parameter is a Tcl command token that identifies the command to be invoked.
  The token may be passed to <b>Tcl_GetCommandName</b>,
  <b>Tcl_GetCommandInfoFromToken</b>, or <b>Tcl_SetCommandInfoFromToken</b> to
  manipulate the definition of the command. The <i>objc</i> and <i>objv</i>
  parameters designate the final parameter count and parameter vector that will
  be passed to the command, and have had all substitutions performed.
<p class="Pp">The <i>objProc</i> callback is expected to return a standard Tcl
    status return code. If this code is <b>TCL_OK</b> (the normal case), then
    the Tcl interpreter will invoke the command. Any other return code is
    treated as if the command returned that status, and the command is
    <i>not</i> invoked.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>objProc</i> callback must not modify <i>objv</i> in any
    way. It is, however, permissible to change the command by calling
    <b>Tcl_SetCommandTokenInfo</b> prior to returning. Any such change takes
    effect immediately, and the command is invoked with the new information.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tracing will only occur for commands at nesting level less than or
    equal to the <i>level</i> parameter (i.e. the <i>level</i> parameter to
    <i>objProc</i> will always be less than or equal to the <i>level</i>
    parameter to <b>Tcl_CreateTrace</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Tracing has a significant effect on runtime performance because it
    causes the bytecode compiler to refrain from generating in-line code for Tcl
    commands such as <b>if</b> and <b>while</b> in order that they may be
    traced. If traces for the built-in commands are not required, the
    <i>flags</i> parameter may be set to the constant value
    <b>TCL_ALLOW_INLINE_COMPILATION</b>. In this case, traces on built-in
    commands may or may not result in trace callbacks, depending on the state of
    the interpreter, but run-time performance will be improved significantly.
    (This functionality is desirable, for example, when using
    <b>Tcl_CreateObjTrace</b> to implement an execution time profiler.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Calls to <i>objProc</i> will be made by the Tcl parser immediately
    before it calls the command procedure for the command (<i>cmdProc</i>). This
    occurs after argument parsing and substitution, so tracing for substituted
    commands occurs before tracing of the commands containing the substitutions.
    If there is a syntax error in a command, or if there is no command procedure
    associated with a command name, then no tracing will occur for that command.
    If a string passed to Tcl_Eval contains multiple commands (bracketed, or on
    different lines) then multiple calls to <i>objProc</i> will occur, one for
    each command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DeleteTrace</b> removes a trace, so that no future calls
    will be made to the procedure associated with the trace. After
    <b>Tcl_DeleteTrace</b> returns, the caller should never again use the
    <i>trace</i> token.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>Tcl_DeleteTrace</b> is called, the interpreter invokes the
    <i>deleteProc</i> that was passed as a parameter to
    <b>Tcl_CreateObjTrace</b>. The <i>deleteProc</i> must match the type,
    <b>Tcl_CmdObjTraceDeleteProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef void <b>Tcl_CmdObjTraceDeleteProc</b>( 
        <b>ClientData</b> <i>clientData</i>);</pre>
</div>
The <i>clientData</i> parameter will be the same as the <i>clientData</i>
  parameter that was originally passed to <b>Tcl_CreateObjTrace</b>.
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_CreateTrace</b> is an alternative interface for command
    tracing, <i>not recommended for new applications</i>. It is provided for
    backward compatibility with code that was developed for older versions of
    the Tcl interpreter. It is similar to <b>Tcl_CreateObjTrace</b>, except that
    its <i>proc</i> parameter should have arguments and result that match the
    type <b>Tcl_CmdTraceProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef void Tcl_CmdTraceProc(
        ClientData <i>clientData</i>,
        Tcl_Interp *<i>interp</i>,
        int <i>level</i>,
        char *<i>command</i>,
        Tcl_CmdProc *<i>cmdProc</i>,
        ClientData <i>cmdClientData</i>,
        int <i>argc</i>,
        const char *<i>argv</i>[]);</pre>
</div>
The parameters to the <i>proc</i> callback are similar to those of the
  <i>objProc</i> callback above. The <i>commandToken</i> is replaced with
  <i>cmdProc</i>, a pointer to the (string-based) command procedure that will be
  invoked; and <i>cmdClientData</i>, the client data that will be passed to the
  procedure. The <i>objc</i> parameter is replaced with an <i>argv</i>
  parameter, that gives the arguments to the command as character strings.
  <i>Proc</i> must not modify the <i>command</i> or <i>argv</i> strings.
<p class="Pp">If a trace created with <b>Tcl_CreateTrace</b> is in effect,
    inline compilation of Tcl commands such as <b>if</b> and <b>while</b> is
    always disabled. There is no notification when a trace created with
    <b>Tcl_CreateTrace</b> is deleted. There is no way to be notified when the
    trace created by <b>Tcl_CreateTrace</b> is deleted. There is no way for the
    <i>proc</i> associated with a call to <b>Tcl_CreateTrace</b> to abort
    execution of <i>command</i>.</p>
