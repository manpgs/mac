   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">This page explains the initialization and use of standard channels
    in the Tcl library.</p>
<p class="Pp">The term <i>standard channels</i> comes out of the Unix world and
    refers to the three channels automatically opened by the OS for each new
    application. They are <b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout</b> and <b>stderr</b>. The
    first is the standard input an application can read from, the other two
    refer to writable channels, one for regular output and the other for error
    messages.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tcl generalizes this concept in a cross-platform way and exposes
    standard channels to the script level.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="APPLICATION_PROGRAMMING_INTERFACES"><a class="permalink" href="#APPLICATION_PROGRAMMING_INTERFACES">APPLICATION
  PROGRAMMING INTERFACES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The public API procedures dealing directly with standard channels
    are <b>Tcl_GetStdChannel</b> and <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b>. Additional public
    APIs to consider are <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b>, <b>Tcl_CreateChannel</b>
    and <b>Tcl_GetChannel</b>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="INITIALIZATION_OF_TCL_STANDARD_CHANNELS"><a class="permalink" href="#INITIALIZATION_OF_TCL_STANDARD_CHANNELS">INITIALIZATION
  OF TCL STANDARD CHANNELS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Standard channels are initialized by the Tcl library in three
    cases: when explicitly requested, when implicitly required before returning
    channel information, or when implicitly required during registration of a
    new channel.</p>
<p class="Pp">These cases differ in how they handle unavailable platform-
    specific standard channels. (A channel is not &#x201C;available&#x201D; if
    it could not be successfully opened; for example, in a Tcl application run
    as a Windows NT service.)</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1)</dt>
  <dd>A single standard channel is initialized when it is explicitly specified
      in a call to <b>Tcl_SetStdChannel</b>. The states of the other standard
      channels are unaffected.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Missing platform-specific standard channels do not matter here.
    This approach is not available at the script level.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>2)</dt>
  <dd>All uninitialized standard channels are initialized to platform-specific
      default values:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(a)</dt>
  <dd>when open channels are listed with <b>Tcl_GetChannelNames</b> (or the
      <b>file channels</b> script command), or</dd>
  <dt>(b)</dt>
  <dd>when information about any standard channel is requested with a call to
      <b>Tcl_GetStdChannel</b>, or with a call to <b>Tcl_GetChannel</b> which
      specifies one of the standard names (<b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout</b> and
      <b>stderr</b>).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In case of missing platform-specific standard channels, the Tcl
    standard channels are considered as initialized and then immediately closed.
    This means that the first three Tcl channels then opened by the application
    are designated as the Tcl standard channels.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>3)</dt>
  <dd>All uninitialized standard channels are initialized to platform-specific
      default values when a user-requested channel is registered with
      <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In case of unavailable platform-specific standard channels the
    channel whose creation caused the initialization of the Tcl standard
    channels is made a normal channel. The next three Tcl channels opened by the
    application are designated as the Tcl standard channels. In other words, of
    the first four Tcl channels opened by the application the second to fourth
    are designated as the Tcl standard channels.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RE-INITIALIZATION_OF_TCL_STANDARD_CHANNELS"><a class="permalink" href="#RE-INITIALIZATION_OF_TCL_STANDARD_CHANNELS">RE-INITIALIZATION
  OF TCL STANDARD CHANNELS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Once a Tcl standard channel is initialized through one of the
    methods above, closing this Tcl standard channel will cause the next call to
    <b>Tcl_CreateChannel</b> to make the new channel the new standard channel,
    too. If more than one Tcl standard channel was closed
    <b>Tcl_CreateChannel</b> will fill the empty slots in the order
    <b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout</b> and <b>stderr</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_CreateChannel</b> will not try to reinitialize an empty
    slot if that slot was not initialized before. It is this behavior which
    enables an application to employ method 1 of initialization, i.e. to create
    and designate their own Tcl standard channels.</p>
