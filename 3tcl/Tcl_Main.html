   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Main</b> can serve as the main program for Tcl-based shell
    applications. A &#x201C;shell application&#x201D; is a program like tclsh or
    wish that supports both interactive interpretation of Tcl and evaluation of
    a script contained in a file given as a command line argument.
    <b>Tcl_Main</b> is offered as a convenience to developers of shell
    applications, so they do not have to reproduce all of the code for proper
    initialization of the Tcl library and interactive shell operation. Other
    styles of embedding Tcl in an application are not supported by
    <b>Tcl_Main</b>. Those must be achieved by calling lower level functions in
    the Tcl library directly.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>Tcl_Main</b> function has been offered by the Tcl library
    since release Tcl 7.4. In older releases of Tcl, the Tcl library itself
    defined a function <b>main</b>, but that lacks flexibility of embedding
    style and having a function <b>main</b> in a library (particularly a shared
    library) causes problems on many systems. Having <b>main</b> in the Tcl
    library would also make it hard to use Tcl in C++ programs, since C++
    programs must have special C++ <b>main</b> functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Normally each shell application contains a small <b>main</b>
    function that does nothing but invoke <b>Tcl_Main</b>. <b>Tcl_Main</b> then
    does all the work of creating and running a <b>tclsh</b>-like
  application.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Main</b> is not provided by the public interface of Tcl's
    stub library. Programs that call <b>Tcl_Main</b> must be linked against the
    standard Tcl library. Extensions (stub-enabled or not) are not intended to
    call <b>Tcl_Main</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Main</b> is not thread-safe. It should only be called by a
    single master thread of a multi-threaded application. This restriction is
    not a problem with normal use described above.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Main</b> and therefore all applications based upon it, like
    <b>tclsh</b>, use <b>Tcl_GetStdChannel</b> to initialize the standard
    channels to their default values. See <b>Tcl_StandardChannels</b> for more
    information.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Main</b> supports two modes of operation, depending on the
    values of <i>argc</i> and <i>argv</i>. If the first few arguments in
    <i>argv</i> match ?<b>-encoding </b><i>name</i>? <i>fileName</i>, where
    <i>fileName</i> does not begin with the character <i>-</i>, then
    <i>fileName</i> is taken to be the name of a file containing a <i>startup
    script</i>, and <i>name</i> is taken to be the name of the encoding of the
    contents of that file, which <b>Tcl_Main</b> will attempt to evaluate.
    Otherwise, <b>Tcl_Main</b> will enter an interactive mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">In either mode, <b>Tcl_Main</b> will define in its master
    interpreter the Tcl variables <i>argc</i>, <i>argv</i>, <i>argv0</i>, and
    <i>tcl_interactive</i>, as described in the documentation for
  <b>tclsh</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When it has finished its own initialization, but before it
    processes commands, <b>Tcl_Main</b> calls the procedure given by the
    <i>appInitProc</i> argument. This procedure provides a &#x201C;hook&#x201D;
    for the application to perform its own initialization of the interpreter
    created by <b>Tcl_Main</b>, such as defining application-specific commands.
    The procedure must have an interface that matches the type
    <b>Tcl_AppInitProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef int Tcl_AppInitProc(Tcl_Interp *<i>interp</i>);</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>AppInitProc</i> is almost always a pointer to
    <b>Tcl_AppInit</b>; for more details on this procedure, see the
    documentation for <b>Tcl_AppInit</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the <i>appInitProc</i> is finished, <b>Tcl_Main</b> enters
    one of its two modes. If a startup script has been provided, <b>Tcl_Main</b>
    attempts to evaluate it. Otherwise, interactive mode begins with examination
    of the variable <i>tcl_rcFileName</i> in the master interpreter. If that
    variable exists and holds the name of a readable file, the contents of that
    file are evaluated in the master interpreter. Then interactive operations
    begin, with prompts and command evaluation results written to the standard
    output channel, and commands read from the standard input channel and then
    evaluated. The prompts written to the standard output channel may be
    customized by defining the Tcl variables <i>tcl_prompt1</i> and
    <i>tcl_prompt2</i> as described in the documentation for <b>tclsh</b>. The
    prompts and command evaluation results are written to the standard output
    channel only if the Tcl variable <i>tcl_interactive</i> in the master
    interpreter holds a non-zero integer value.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_SetMainLoop</b> allows setting an event loop procedure to
    be run. This allows, for example, Tk to be dynamically loaded and set its
    event loop. The event loop will run following the startup script. If you are
    in interactive mode, setting the main loop procedure will cause the prompt
    to become fileevent based and then the loop procedure is called. When the
    loop procedure returns in interactive mode, interactive operation will
    continue. The main loop procedure must have an interface that matches the
    type <b>Tcl_MainLoopProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef void Tcl_MainLoopProc(void);</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_Main</b> does not return. Normally a program based on
    <b>Tcl_Main</b> will terminate when the <b>exit</b> command is evaluated. In
    interactive mode, if an EOF or channel error is encountered on the standard
    input channel, then <b>Tcl_Main</b> itself will evaluate the <b>exit</b>
    command after the main loop procedure (if any) returns. In non-interactive
    mode, after <b>Tcl_Main</b> evaluates the startup script, and the main loop
    procedure (if any) returns, <b>Tcl_Main</b> will also evaluate the
    <b>exit</b> command.</p>
