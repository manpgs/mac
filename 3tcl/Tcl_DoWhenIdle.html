   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b> arranges for <i>proc</i> to be invoked when
    the application becomes idle. The application is considered to be idle when
    <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> has been called, could not find any events to handle,
    and is about to go to sleep waiting for an event to occur. At this point all
    pending <b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b> handlers are invoked. For each call to
    <b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b> there will be a single call to <i>proc</i>; after
    <i>proc</i> is invoked the handler is automatically removed.
    <b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b> is only usable in programs that use
    <b>Tcl_DoOneEvent</b> to dispatch events.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Proc</i> should have arguments and result that match the type
    <b>Tcl_IdleProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef void Tcl_IdleProc(ClientData <i>clientData</i>);
</pre>
</div>
The <i>clientData</i> parameter to <i>proc</i> is a copy of the
  <i>clientData</i> argument given to <b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b>. Typically,
  <i>clientData</i> points to a data structure containing application-specific
  information about what <i>proc</i> should do.
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_CancelIdleCall</b> may be used to cancel one or more
    previous calls to <b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b>: if there is a <b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b>
    handler registered for <i>proc</i> and <i>clientData</i>, then it is removed
    without invoking it. If there is more than one handler on the idle list that
    refers to <i>proc</i> and <i>clientData</i>, all of the handlers are
    removed. If no existing handlers match <i>proc</i> and <i>clientData</i>
    then nothing happens.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b> is most useful in situations where (a) a
    piece of work will have to be done but (b) it is possible that something
    will happen in the near future that will change what has to be done or
    require something different to be done. <b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b> allows the
    actual work to be deferred until all pending events have been processed. At
    this point the exact work to be done will presumably be known and it can be
    done exactly once.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, <b>Tcl_DoWhenIdle</b> might be used by an editor to
    defer display updates until all pending commands have been processed.
    Without this feature, redundant redisplays might occur in some situations,
    such as the processing of a command file.</p>

<p class="Pp">At present it is not safe for an idle callback to reschedule
    itself continuously. This will interact badly with certain features of Tk
    that attempt to wait for all idle callbacks to complete. If you would like
    for an idle callback to reschedule itself continuously, it is better to use
    a timer handler with a zero timeout period.</p>
