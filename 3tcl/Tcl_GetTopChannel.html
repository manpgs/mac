   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">These functions are for use by extensions that add processing
    layers to Tcl I/O channels. Examples include compression and encryption
    modules. These functions transparently stack and unstack a new channel on
    top of an existing one. Any number of channels can be stacked together.</p>
<p class="Pp">The implementation of the Tcl channel code was rewritten in 8.3.2
    to correct some problems with the previous implementation with regard to
    stacked channels. Anyone using stacked channels or creating stacked channel
    drivers should update to the new <b>TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_2</b>
    <b>Tcl_ChannelType</b> structure. See <b>Tcl_CreateChannel</b> for
  details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_StackChannel</b> stacks a new <i>channel</i> on an existing
    channel with the same name that was registered for <i>channel</i> by
    <b>Tcl_RegisterChannel</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_StackChannel</b> works by creating a new channel structure
    and placing itself on top of the channel stack. EOL translation, encoding
    and buffering options are shared between all channels in the stack. The
    hidden channel does no buffering, newline translations, or character set
    encoding. Instead, the buffering, newline translations, and encoding
    functions all remain at the top of the channel stack. A pointer to the new
    top channel structure is returned. If an error occurs when stacking the
    channel, NULL is returned instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>mask</i> parameter specifies the operations that are
    allowed on the new channel. These can be a subset of the operations allowed
    on the original channel. For example, a read-write channel may become
    read-only after the <b>Tcl_StackChannel</b> call.</p>
<p class="Pp">Closing a channel closes the channels stacked below it. The close
    of stacked channels is executed in a way that allows buffered data to be
    properly flushed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_UnstackChannel</b> reverses the process. The old channel is
    associated with the channel name, and the processing module added by
    <b>Tcl_StackChannel</b> is destroyed. If there is no old channel, then
    <b>Tcl_UnstackChannel</b> is equivalent to <b>Tcl_Close</b>. If an error
    occurs unstacking the channel, <b>TCL_ERROR</b> is returned, otherwise
    <b>TCL_OK</b> is returned.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_GetTopChannel</b> returns the top channel in the stack of
    channels the supplied channel is part of.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_GetStackedChannel</b> returns the channel in the stack of
    channels which is just below the supplied channel.</p>
