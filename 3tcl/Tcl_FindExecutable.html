   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">The <b>Tcl_FindExecutable</b> procedure computes the full path
    name of the executable file from which the application was invoked and saves
    it for Tcl's internal use. The executable's path name is needed for several
    purposes in Tcl. For example, it is needed on some platforms in the
    implementation of the <b>load</b> command. It is also returned by the
    <b>info nameofexecutable</b> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">On UNIX platforms this procedure is typically invoked as the very
    first thing in the application's main program; it must be passed
    <i>argv[0]</i> as its argument. It is important not to change the working
    directory before the invocation. <b>Tcl_FindExecutable</b> uses <i>argv0</i>
    along with the <b>PATH</b> environment variable to find the application's
    executable, if possible. If it fails to find the binary, then future calls
    to <b>info nameofexecutable</b> will return an empty string.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_GetNameOfExecutable</b> simply returns a pointer to the
    internal full path name of the executable file as computed by
    <b>Tcl_FindExecutable</b>. This procedure call is the C API equivalent to
    the <b>info nameofexecutable</b> command. NULL is returned if the internal
    full path name has not been computed or unknown.</p>
