   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">The <b>Tcl_CreateInterp</b> procedure returns a pointer to a
    Tcl_Interp structure. This pointer is then passed into other Tcl procedures
    to process commands in the interpreter and perform other operations on the
    interpreter. Interpreter structures contain many fields that are used by
    Tcl, but only three that may be accessed by clients: <i>result</i>,
    <i>freeProc</i>, and <i>errorLine</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note that access to all three fields, </b><i>result</i><b>,
    </b><i>freeProc</i><b> and</b> <b></b><i>errorLine</i><b> is deprecated.</b>
    Use <b>Tcl_SetResult</b>, <b>Tcl_GetResult</b>, and
    <b>Tcl_GetReturnOptions</b> instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>result</i> and <i>freeProc</i> fields are used to return
    results or error messages from commands. This information is returned by
    command procedures back to <b>Tcl_Eval</b>, and by <b>Tcl_Eval</b> back to
    its callers. The <i>result</i> field points to the string that represents
    the result or error message, and the <i>freeProc</i> field tells how to
    dispose of the storage for the string when it is not needed anymore. The
    easiest way for command procedures to manipulate these fields is to call
    procedures like <b>Tcl_SetResult</b> or <b>Tcl_AppendResult</b>; they will
    hide all the details of managing the fields. The description below is for
    those procedures that manipulate the fields directly.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whenever a command procedure returns, it must ensure that the
    <i>result</i> field of its interpreter points to the string being returned
    by the command. The <i>result</i> field must always point to a valid string.
    If a command wishes to return no result then <i>interp-&gt;result</i> should
    point to an empty string. Normally, results are assumed to be statically
    allocated, which means that the contents will not change before the next
    time <b>Tcl_Eval</b> is called or some other command procedure is invoked.
    In this case, the <i>freeProc</i> field must be zero. Alternatively, a
    command procedure may dynamically allocate its return value (e.g. using
    <b>Tcl_Alloc</b>) and store a pointer to it in <i>interp-&gt;result</i>. In
    this case, the command procedure must also set <i>interp-&gt;freeProc</i> to
    the address of a procedure that can free the value, or <b>TCL_DYNAMIC</b> if
    the storage was allocated directly by Tcl or by a call to <b>Tcl_Alloc</b>.
    If <i>interp-&gt;freeProc</i> is non-zero, then Tcl will call
    <i>freeProc</i> to free the space pointed to by <i>interp-&gt;result</i>
    before it invokes the next command. If a client procedure overwrites
    <i>interp-&gt;result</i> when <i>interp-&gt;freeProc</i> is non-zero, then
    it is responsible for calling <i>freeProc</i> to free the old
    <i>interp-&gt;result</i> (the <b>Tcl_FreeResult</b> macro should be used for
    this purpose).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>FreeProc</i> should have arguments and result that match the
    <b>Tcl_FreeProc</b> declaration above: it receives a single argument which
    is a pointer to the result value to free. In most applications
    <b>TCL_DYNAMIC</b> is the only non-zero value ever used for <i>freeProc</i>.
    However, an application may store a different procedure address in
    <i>freeProc</i> in order to use an alternate memory allocator or in order to
    do other cleanup when the result memory is freed.</p>
<p class="Pp">As part of processing each command, <b>Tcl_Eval</b> initializes
    <i>interp-&gt;result</i> and <i>interp-&gt;freeProc</i> just before calling
    the command procedure for the command. The <i>freeProc</i> field will be
    initialized to zero, and <i>interp-&gt;result</i> will point to an empty
    string. Commands that do not return any value can simply leave the fields
    alone. Furthermore, the empty string pointed to by <i>result</i> is actually
    part of an array of <b>TCL_RESULT_SIZE</b> characters (approximately 200).
    If a command wishes to return a short string, it can simply copy it to the
    area pointed to by <i>interp-&gt;result</i>. Or, it can use the sprintf
    procedure to generate a short result string at the location pointed to by
    <i>interp-&gt;result</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is a general convention in Tcl-based applications that the
    result of an interpreter is normally in the initialized state described in
    the previous paragraph. Procedures that manipulate an interpreter's result
    (e.g. by returning an error) will generally assume that the result has been
    initialized when the procedure is called. If such a procedure is to be
    called after the result has been changed, then <b>Tcl_ResetResult</b> should
    be called first to reset the result to its initialized state. The direct use
    of <i>interp-&gt;result</i> is strongly deprecated (see
    <b>Tcl_SetResult</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>errorLine</i> field is valid only after <b>Tcl_Eval</b>
    returns a <b>TCL_ERROR</b> return code. In this situation the
    <i>errorLine</i> field identifies the line number of the command being
    executed when the error occurred. The line numbers are relative to the
    command being executed: 1 means the first line of the command passed to
    <b>Tcl_Eval</b>, 2 means the second line, and so on. The <i>errorLine</i>
    field is typically used in conjunction with <b>Tcl_AddErrorInfo</b> to
    report information about where an error occurred. <i>ErrorLine</i> should
    not normally be modified except by <b>Tcl_Eval</b>.</p>
