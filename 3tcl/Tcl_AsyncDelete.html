   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">These procedures provide a safe mechanism for dealing with
    asynchronous events such as signals. If an event such as a signal occurs
    while a Tcl script is being evaluated then it is not safe to take any
    substantive action to process the event. For example, it is not safe to
    evaluate a Tcl script since the interpreter may already be in the middle of
    evaluating a script; it may not even be safe to allocate memory, since a
    memory allocation could have been in progress when the event occurred. The
    only safe approach is to set a flag indicating that the event occurred, then
    handle the event later when the world has returned to a clean state, such as
    after the current Tcl command completes.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_AsyncCreate</b>, <b>Tcl_AsyncDelete</b>, and
    <b>Tcl_AsyncReady</b> are thread sensitive. They access and/or set a
    thread-specific data structure in the event of a core built with
    <i>--enable-threads</i>. The token created by <b>Tcl_AsyncCreate</b>
    contains the needed thread information it was called from so that calling
    <b>Tcl_AsyncMark</b>(<i>token</i>) will only yield the origin thread into
    the asynchronous handler.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_AsyncCreate</b> creates an asynchronous handler and returns
    a token for it. The asynchronous handler must be created before any
    occurrences of the asynchronous event that it is intended to handle (it is
    not safe to create a handler at the time of an event). When an asynchronous
    event occurs the code that detects the event (such as a signal handler)
    should call <b>Tcl_AsyncMark</b> with the token for the handler.
    <b>Tcl_AsyncMark</b> will mark the handler as ready to execute, but it will
    not invoke the handler immediately. Tcl will call the <i>proc</i> associated
    with the handler later, when the world is in a safe state, and <i>proc</i>
    can then carry out the actions associated with the asynchronous event.
    <i>Proc</i> should have arguments and result that match the type
    <b>Tcl_AsyncProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef int Tcl_AsyncProc(
        ClientData <i>clientData</i>,
        Tcl_Interp *<i>interp</i>,
        int <i>code</i>);
</pre>
</div>
The <i>clientData</i> will be the same as the <i>clientData</i> argument passed
  to <b>Tcl_AsyncCreate</b> when the handler was created. If <i>proc</i> is
  invoked just after a command has completed execution in an interpreter, then
  <i>interp</i> will identify the interpreter in which the command was evaluated
  and <i>code</i> will be the completion code returned by that command. The
  command's result will be present in the interpreter's result. When <i>proc</i>
  returns, whatever it leaves in the interpreter's result will be returned as
  the result of the command and the integer value returned by <i>proc</i> will
  be used as the new completion code for the command.
<p class="Pp">It is also possible for <i>proc</i> to be invoked when no
    interpreter is active. This can happen, for example, if an asynchronous
    event occurs while the application is waiting for interactive input or an X
    event. In this case <i>interp</i> will be NULL and <i>code</i> will be 0,
    and the return value from <i>proc</i> will be ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">The procedure <b>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</b> is called to invoke all of
    the handlers that are ready. The procedure <b>Tcl_AsyncReady</b> will return
    non-zero whenever any asynchronous handlers are ready; it can be checked to
    avoid calls to <b>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</b> when there are no ready handlers. Tcl
    calls <b>Tcl_AsyncReady</b> after each command is evaluated and calls
    <b>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</b> if needed. Applications may also call
    <b>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</b> at interesting times for that application. For
    example, Tcl's event handler calls <b>Tcl_AsyncReady</b> after each event
    and calls <b>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</b> if needed. The <i>interp</i> and
    <i>code</i> arguments to <b>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</b> have the same meaning as for
    <i>proc</i>: they identify the active interpreter, if any, and the
    completion code from the command that just completed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_AsyncDelete</b> removes an asynchronous handler so that its
    <i>proc</i> will never be invoked again. A handler can be deleted even when
    ready, and it will still not be invoked.</p>
<p class="Pp">If multiple handlers become active at the same time, the handlers
    are invoked in the order they were created (oldest handler first). The
    <i>code</i> and the interpreter's result for later handlers reflect the
    values returned by earlier handlers, so that the most recently created
    handler has last say about the interpreter's result and completion code. If
    new handlers become ready while handlers are executing,
    <b>Tcl_AsyncInvoke</b> will invoke them all; at each point it invokes the
    highest-priority (oldest) ready handler, repeating this over and over until
    there are no longer any ready handlers.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="WARNING"><a class="permalink" href="#WARNING">WARNING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">It is almost always a bad idea for an asynchronous event handler
    to modify the interpreter's result or return a code different from its
    <i>code</i> argument. This sort of behavior can disrupt the execution of
    scripts in subtle ways and result in bugs that are extremely difficult to
    track down. If an asynchronous event handler needs to evaluate Tcl scripts
    then it should first save the interpreter's state by calling
    <b>Tcl_SaveInterpState</b>, passing in the <i>code</i> argument. When the
    asynchronous handler is finished it should restore the interpreter's state
    by calling <b>Tcl_RestoreInterpState</b>, and then returning the <i>code</i>
    argument.</p>
