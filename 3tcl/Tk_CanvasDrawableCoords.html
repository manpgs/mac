   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">These procedures are called by canvas type managers to perform
    various utility functions.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_CanvasTkwin</b> returns the Tk_Window associated with a
    particular canvas.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_CanvasGetCoord</b> translates a string specification of a
    coordinate (such as <b>2p</b> or <b>1.6c</b>) into a double-precision canvas
    coordinate. If <i>string</i> is a valid coordinate description then
    <b>Tk_CanvasGetCoord</b> stores the corresponding canvas coordinate at
    *<i>doublePtr</i> and returns <b>TCL_OK</b>. Otherwise it stores an error
    message in <i>interp-&gt;result</i> and returns <b>TCL_ERROR</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_CanvasDrawableCoords</b> is called by type managers during
    redisplay to compute where to draw things. Given <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>
    coordinates in the space of the canvas, <b>Tk_CanvasDrawableCoords</b>
    computes the corresponding pixel in the drawable that is currently being
    used for redisplay; it returns those coordinates in *<i>drawableXPtr</i> and
    *<i>drawableYPtr</i>. This procedure should not be invoked except during
    redisplay.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_CanvasSetStippleOrigin</b> is also used during redisplay. It
    sets the stipple origin in <i>gc</i> so that stipples drawn with <i>gc</i>
    in the current offscreen pixmap will line up with stipples drawn with origin
    (0,0) in the canvas's actual window. <b>Tk_CanvasSetStippleOrigin</b> is
    needed in order to guarantee that stipple patterns line up properly when the
    canvas is redisplayed in small pieces. Redisplays are carried out in
    double-buffered fashion where a piece of the canvas is redrawn in an
    offscreen pixmap and then copied back onto the screen. In this approach the
    stipple origins in graphics contexts need to be adjusted during each
    redisplay to compensate for the position of the off-screen pixmap relative
    to the window. If an item is being drawn with stipples, its type manager
    typically calls <b>Tk_CanvasSetStippleOrigin</b> just before using <i>gc</i>
    to draw something; after it is finished drawing, the type manager calls
    <b>XSetTSOrigin</b> to restore the origin in <i>gc</i> back to (0,0) (the
    restore is needed because graphics contexts are shared, so they cannot be
    modified permanently).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_CanvasWindowCoords</b> is similar to
    <b>Tk_CanvasDrawableCoords</b> except that it returns coordinates in the
    canvas's window on the screen, instead of coordinates in an off-screen
    pixmap.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_CanvasEventuallyRedraw</b> may be invoked by a type manager
    to inform Tk that a portion of a canvas needs to be redrawn. The <i>x1</i>,
    <i>y1</i>, <i>x2</i>, and <i>y2</i> arguments specify the region that needs
    to be redrawn, in canvas coordinates. Type managers rarely need to invoke
    <b>Tk_CanvasEventuallyRedraw</b>, since Tk can normally figure out when an
    item has changed and make the redisplay request on its behalf (this happens,
    for example whenever Tk calls a <i>configureProc</i> or <i>scaleProc</i>).
    The only time that a type manager needs to call
    <b>Tk_CanvasEventuallyRedraw</b> is if an item has changed on its own
    without being invoked through one of the procedures in its Tk_ItemType; this
    could happen, for example, in an image item if the image is modified using
    image commands.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_CanvasTagsParseProc</b> and <b>Tk_CanvasTagsPrintProc</b>
    are procedures that handle the <b>-tags</b> option for canvas items. The
    code of a canvas type manager will not call these procedures directly, but
    will use their addresses to create a <b>Tk_CustomOption</b> structure for
    the <b>-tags</b> option. The code typically looks like this:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
static Tk_CustomOption tagsOption = {Tk_CanvasTagsParseProc,
<br/>
    Tk_CanvasTagsPrintProc, (ClientData) NULL
};
static Tk_ConfigSpec configSpecs[] = {
<br/>
    ...
<br/>
    {TK_CONFIG_CUSTOM, &quot;-tags&quot;, (char *) NULL, (char *) NULL,
<br/>
        (char *) NULL, 0, TK_CONFIG_NULL_OK, &amp;tagsOption},
<br/>
    ...
};
