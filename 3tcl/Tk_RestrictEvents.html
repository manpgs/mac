   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">This procedure is useful in certain situations where applications
    are only prepared to receive certain X events. After
    <b>Tk_RestrictEvents</b> is called, <b>Tk_DoOneEvent</b> (and hence
    <b>Tk_MainLoop</b>) will filter X input events through <i>proc</i>.
    <i>Proc</i> indicates whether a given event is to be processed immediately,
    deferred until some later time (e.g. when the event restriction is lifted),
    or discarded. <i>Proc</i> is a procedure with arguments and result that
    match the type <b>Tk_RestrictProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef Tk_RestrictAction Tk_RestrictProc(
    ClientData <i>clientData</i>,
    XEvent *<i>eventPtr</i>);
</pre>
</div>
The <i>clientData</i> argument is a copy of the <i>clientData</i> passed to
  <b>Tk_RestrictEvents</b>; it may be used to provide <i>proc</i> with
  information it needs to filter events. The <i>eventPtr</i> points to an event
  under consideration. <i>Proc</i> returns a restrict action (enumerated type
  <b>Tk_RestrictAction</b>) that indicates what <b>Tk_DoOneEvent</b> should do
  with the event. If the return value is <b>TK_PROCESS_EVENT</b>, then the event
  will be handled immediately. If the return value is <b>TK_DEFER_EVENT</b>,
  then the event will be left on the event queue for later processing. If the
  return value is <b>TK_DISCARD_EVENT</b>, then the event will be removed from
  the event queue and discarded without being processed.
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_RestrictEvents</b> uses its return value and
    <i>prevClientDataPtr</i> to return information about the current event
    restriction procedure (a NULL return value means there are currently no
    restrictions). These values may be used to restore the previous restriction
    state when there is no longer any need for the current restriction.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are very few places where <b>Tk_RestrictEvents</b> is
    needed. In most cases, the best way to restrict events is by changing the
    bindings with the <b>bind</b> Tcl command or by calling
    <b>Tk_CreateEventHandler</b> and <b>Tk_DeleteEventHandler</b> from C. The
    main place where <b>Tk_RestrictEvents</b> must be used is when performing
    synchronous actions (for example, if you need to wait for a particular event
    to occur on a particular window but you do not want to invoke any handlers
    for any other events). The &#x201C;obvious&#x201D; solution in these
    situations is to call <b>XNextEvent</b> or <b>XWindowEvent</b>, but these
    procedures cannot be used because Tk keeps its own event queue that is
    separate from the X event queue. Instead, call <b>Tk_RestrictEvents</b> to
    set up a filter, then call <b>Tk_DoOneEvent</b> to retrieve the desired
    event(s).</p>
