   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_CreateGenericHandler</b> arranges for <i>proc</i> to be
    invoked in the future whenever any X event occurs. This mechanism is
    <i>not</i> intended for dispatching X events on windows managed by Tk (you
    should use <b>Tk_CreateEventHandler</b> for this purpose).
    <b>Tk_CreateGenericHandler</b> is intended for other purposes, such as
    tracing X events, monitoring events on windows not owned by Tk, accessing
    X-related libraries that were not originally designed for use with Tk, and
    so on.</p>
<p class="Pp">The callback to <i>proc</i> will be made by <b>Tk_HandleEvent</b>;
    this mechanism only works in programs that dispatch events through
    <b>Tk_HandleEvent</b> (or through other Tk procedures that call
    <b>Tk_HandleEvent</b>, such as <b>Tk_DoOneEvent</b> or
  <b>Tk_MainLoop</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Proc</i> should have arguments and result that match the type
    <b>Tk_GenericProc</b>:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef int Tk_GenericProc(
    ClientData <i>clientData</i>,
    XEvent *<i>eventPtr</i>);</pre>
</div>
The <i>clientData</i> parameter to <i>proc</i> is a copy of the
  <i>clientData</i> argument given to <b>Tk_CreateGenericHandler</b> when the
  callback was created. Typically, <i>clientData</i> points to a data structure
  containing application-specific information about how to handle events.
  <i>EventPtr</i> is a pointer to the X event.
<p class="Pp">Whenever an X event is processed by <b>Tk_HandleEvent</b>,
    <i>proc</i> is called. The return value from <i>proc</i> is normally 0. A
    non-zero return value indicates that the event is not to be handled further;
    that is, <i>proc</i> has done all processing that is to be allowed for the
    event.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there are multiple generic event handlers, each one is called
    for each event, in the order in which they were established.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tk_DeleteGenericHandler</b> may be called to delete a
    previously-created generic event handler: it deletes each handler it finds
    that matches the <i>proc</i> and <i>clientData</i> arguments. If no such
    handler exists, then <b>Tk_DeleteGenericHandler</b> returns without doing
    anything. Although Tk supports it, it's probably a bad idea to have more
    than one callback with the same <i>proc</i> and <i>clientData</i>
  arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">Establishing a generic event handler does nothing to ensure that
    the process will actually receive the X events that the handler wants to
    process. For example, it is the caller's responsibility to invoke
    <b>XSelectInput</b> to select the desired events, if that is necessary.</p>
