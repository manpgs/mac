   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DetachPids</b> and <b>Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs</b> provide a
    mechanism for managing subprocesses that are running in background. These
    procedures are needed because the parent of a process must eventually invoke
    the <b>waitpid</b> kernel call (or one of a few other similar kernel calls)
    to wait for the child to exit. Until the parent waits for the child, the
    child's state cannot be completely reclaimed by the system. If a parent
    continually creates children and doesn't wait on them, the system's process
    table will eventually overflow, even if all the children have exited.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_DetachPids</b> may be called to ask Tcl to take
    responsibility for one or more processes whose process ids are contained in
    the <i>pidPtr</i> array passed as argument. The caller presumably has
    started these processes running in background and does not want to have to
    deal with them again.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs</b> invokes the <b>waitpid</b> kernel
    call on each of the background processes so that its state can be cleaned up
    if it has exited. If the process has not exited yet,
    <b>Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs</b> does not wait for it to exit; it will check
    again the next time it is invoked. Tcl automatically calls
    <b>Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs</b> each time the <b>exec</b> command is executed,
    so in most cases it is not necessary for any code outside of Tcl to invoke
    <b>Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs</b>. However, if you call <b>Tcl_DetachPids</b> in
    situations where the <b>exec</b> command may never get executed, you may
    wish to call <b>Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs</b> from time to time so that
    background processes can be cleaned up.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tcl_WaitPid</b> is a thin wrapper around the facilities
    provided by the operating system to wait on the end of a spawned process and
    to check a whether spawned process is still running. It is used by
    <b>Tcl_ReapDetachedProcs</b> and the channel system to portably access the
    operating system.</p>
