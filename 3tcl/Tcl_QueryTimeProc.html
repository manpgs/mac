   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<p class="Pp">The <b>Tcl_GetTime</b> function retrieves the current time as a
    <i>Tcl_Time</i> structure in memory the caller provides. This structure has
    the following definition:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
typedef struct Tcl_Time {
    long sec;
    long usec;
} Tcl_Time;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">On return, the <i>sec</i> member of the structure is filled in
    with the number of seconds that have elapsed since the <i>epoch:</i> the
    epoch is the point in time of 00:00 UTC, 1 January 1970. This number does
    <i>not</i> count leap seconds - an interval of one day advances it by 86400
    seconds regardless of whether a leap second has been inserted.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>usec</i> member of the structure is filled in with the
    number of microseconds that have elapsed since the start of the second
    designated by <i>sec</i>. The Tcl library makes every effort to keep this
    number as precise as possible, subject to the limitations of the computer
    system. On multiprocessor variants of Windows, this number may be limited to
    the 10- or 20-ms granularity of the system clock. (On single-processor
    Windows systems, the <i>usec</i> field is derived from a performance counter
    and is highly precise.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>Tcl_SetTime</b> function registers two related handler
    functions with the core. The first handler function is a replacement for
    <b>Tcl_GetTime</b>, or rather the OS access made by <b>Tcl_GetTime</b>. The
    other handler function is used by the Tcl notifier to convert wait/block
    times from the virtual domain into real time.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>Tcl_QueryTime</b> function returns the currently registered
    handler functions. If no external handlers were set then this will return
    the standard handlers accessing and processing the native time of the OS.
    The arguments to the function are allowed to be NULL; and any argument which
    is NULL is ignored and not set.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any handler pair specified has to return data which is consistent
    between them. In other words, setting one handler of the pair to something
    assuming a 10-times slowdown, and the other handler of the pair to something
    assuming a two-times slowdown is wrong and not allowed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The set handler functions are allowed to run the delivered time
    backwards, however this should be avoided. We have to allow it as the native
    time can run backwards as the user can fiddle with the system time one way
    or other. Note that the insertion of the hooks will not change the behaviour
    of the Tcl core with regard to this situation, i.e. the existing behaviour
    is retained.</p>
