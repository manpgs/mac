<p class="Pp">This module is based on
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;Carp.pm&quot;</span>&quot; from Perl 5.005_03.
    It has been modified to skip all package names matching the pattern given in
    the &quot;use&quot; statement inside the
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;qw()&quot;</span>&quot; term (or argument
    list).</p>
<p class="Pp">Suppose you have a family of modules or classes named
    &quot;Pack::A&quot;, &quot;Pack::B&quot; and so on, and each of them uses
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;Carp::Clan qw(^Pack::);&quot;</span>&quot; (or
    at least the one in which the error or warning gets raised).</p>
<p class="Pp">Thus when for example your script &quot;tool.pl&quot; calls module
    &quot;Pack::A&quot;, and module &quot;Pack::A&quot; calls module
    &quot;Pack::B&quot;, an exception raised in module &quot;Pack::B&quot; will
    appear to have originated in &quot;tool.pl&quot; where &quot;Pack::A&quot;
    was called, and not in &quot;Pack::A&quot; where &quot;Pack::B&quot; was
    called, as the unmodified
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;Carp.pm&quot;</span>&quot; would try to make
    you believe <span class="Li">&quot;:-)&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This works similarly if &quot;Pack::B&quot; calls
    &quot;Pack::C&quot; where the exception is raised, etcetera.</p>
<p class="Pp">In other words, this blames all errors in the
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;Pack::*&quot;</span>&quot; modules on the user
    of these modules, i.e., on you. <span class="Li">&quot;;-)&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Pp">The skipping of a clan (or family) of packages according to a
    pattern describing its members is necessary in cases where these modules are
    not classes derived from each other (and thus when examining
    <span class="Li">@ISA</span> - as in the original
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;Carp.pm&quot;</span>&quot; module - doesn't
    help).</p>
<p class="Pp">The purpose and advantage of this is that a &quot;clan&quot; of
    modules can work together (and call each other) and throw exceptions at
    various depths down the calling hierarchy and still appear as a monolithic
    block (as though they were a single module) from the perspective of the
    caller.</p>
<p class="Pp">In case you just want to ward off all error messages from the
    module in which you &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;use
    Carp::Clan&quot;</span>&quot;, i.e., if you want to make all error messages
    or warnings to appear to originate from where your module was called (this
    is what you usually used to &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;use
    Carp;&quot;</span>&quot; for <span class="Li">&quot;;-)&quot;</span>),
    instead of in your module itself (which is what you can do with a
    &quot;die&quot; or &quot;warn&quot; anyway), you do not need to provide a
    pattern, the module will automatically provide the correct one for you.</p>
<p class="Pp">I.e., just &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;use
    Carp::Clan;&quot;</span>&quot; without any arguments and call
    &quot;carp&quot; or &quot;croak&quot; as appropriate, and they will
    automatically defend your module against all blames!</p>
<p class="Pp">In other words, a pattern is only necessary if you want to make
    several modules (more than one) work together and appear as though they were
    only one.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Forcing_a_Stack_Trace"><a class="permalink" href="#Forcing_a_Stack_Trace">Forcing
  a Stack Trace</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As a debugging aid, you can force
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;Carp::Clan&quot;</span>&quot; to treat a
    &quot;croak&quot; as a &quot;confess&quot; and a &quot;carp&quot; as a
    &quot;cluck&quot;. In other words, force a detailed stack trace to be given.
    This can be very helpful when trying to understand why, or from where, a
    warning or error is being generated.</p>
<p class="Pp">This feature is enabled either by &quot;importing&quot; the
    non-existent symbol 'verbose', or by setting the global variable
    &quot;<span class="Li">$Carp::Clan::Verbose</span>&quot; to a true
  value.</p>
<p class="Pp">You would typically enable it by saying</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Carp::Clan qw(verbose);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that you can both specify a &quot;family pattern&quot; and
    the string &quot;verbose&quot; inside the
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;qw()&quot;</span>&quot; term (or argument list)
    of the &quot;use&quot; statement, but consider that a pattern of packages to
    skip is pointless when &quot;verbose&quot; causes a full stack trace
  anyway.</p>

<p class="Pp">The &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;Carp::Clan&quot;</span>&quot;
    routines don't handle exception objects currently. If called with a first
    argument that is a reference, they simply call
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;die()&quot;</span>&quot; or
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;warn()&quot;</span>&quot;, as appropriate.</p>
