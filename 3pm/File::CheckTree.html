<p class="Pp">The <i>validate()</i> routine takes a single multiline string
    consisting of directives, each containing a filename plus a file test to try
    on it. (The file test may also be a &quot;cd&quot;, causing subsequent
    relative filenames to be interpreted relative to that directory.) After the
    file test you may put <span class="Li">&quot;|| die&quot;</span> to make it
    a fatal error if the file test fails. The default is
    <span class="Li">&quot;|| warn&quot;</span>. The file test may optionally
    have a &quot;!' prepended to test for the opposite condition. If you do a cd
    and then list some relative filenames, you may want to indent them slightly
    for readability. If you supply your own <i>die()</i> or <i>warn()</i>
    message, you can use <span class="Li">$file</span> to interpolate the
    filename.</p>
<p class="Pp">Filetests may be bunched: &quot;-rwx&quot; tests for all of
    <span class="Li">&quot;-r&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;-w&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;-x&quot;</span>. Only the first failed test of the
    bunch will produce a warning.</p>
<p class="Pp">The routine returns the number of warnings issued.</p>

<p class="Pp">File::CheckTree was derived from lib/validate.pl which was written
    by Larry Wall. Revised by Paul Grassie &lt;<i>grassie@perl.com</i>&gt; in
    2002.</p>

<p class="Pp">File::CheckTree used to not display fatal error messages. It used
    to count only those warnings produced by a generic <span class="Li">&quot;||
    warn&quot;</span> (and not those in which the user supplied the message). In
    addition, the <i>validate()</i> routine would leave the user program in
    whatever directory was last entered through the use of &quot;cd&quot;
    directives. These bugs were fixed during the development of perl 5.8. The
    first fixed version of File::CheckTree was 4.2.</p>
