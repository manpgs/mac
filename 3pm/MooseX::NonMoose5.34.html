<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;MooseX::NonMoose&quot;</span> allows for
    easily subclassing non-Moose classes with Moose, taking care of the annoying
    details connected with doing this, such as setting up proper inheritance
    from Moose::Object and installing (and inlining, at
    <span class="Li">&quot;make_immutable&quot;</span> time) a constructor that
    makes sure things like <span class="Li">&quot;BUILD&quot;</span> methods are
    called. It tries to be as non-intrusive as possible - when this module is
    used, inheriting from non-Moose classes and inheriting from Moose classes
    should work identically, aside from the few caveats mentioned below. One of
    the goals of this module is that including it in a Moose::Exporter-based
    package used across an entire application should be possible, without
    interfering with classes that only inherit from Moose modules, or even
    classes that don't inherit from anything at all.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are several ways to use this module. The most
    straightforward is to just <span class="Li">&quot;use
    MooseX::NonMoose;&quot;</span> in your class; this should set up everything
    necessary for extending non-Moose modules.
    MooseX::NonMoose::Meta::Role::Class and
    MooseX::NonMoose::Meta::Role::Constructor can also be applied to your
    metaclasses manually, either by passing a
    <span class="Li">&quot;-traits&quot;</span> option to your
    <span class="Li">&quot;use</span> <span class="Li">Moose;&quot;</span> line,
    or by applying them using Moose::Util::MetaRole in a Moose::Exporter-based
    package. MooseX::NonMoose::Meta::Role::Class is the part that provides the
    main functionality of this module; if you don't care about inlining, this is
    all you need to worry about. Applying
    MooseX::NonMoose::Meta::Role::Constructor as well will provide an inlined
    constructor when you immutabilize your class.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;MooseX::NonMoose&quot;</span> allows you to
    manipulate the argument list that gets passed to the superclass constructor
    by defining a <span class="Li">&quot;FOREIGNBUILDARGS&quot;</span> method.
    This is called with the same argument list as the
    <span class="Li">&quot;BUILDARGS&quot;</span> method, but should return a
    list of arguments to pass to the superclass constructor. This allows
    <span class="Li">&quot;MooseX::NonMoose&quot;</span> to support superclasses
    whose constructors would get confused by the extra arguments that Moose
    requires (for attributes, etc.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Not all non-Moose classes use
    <span class="Li">&quot;new&quot;</span> as the name of their constructor.
    This module allows you to extend these classes by explicitly stating which
    method is the constructor, during the call to
    <span class="Li">&quot;extends&quot;</span>. The syntax looks like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  extends 'Foo' =&gt; { -constructor_name =&gt; 'create' };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">similar to how you can already pass
    <span class="Li">&quot;-version&quot;</span> in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;extends&quot;</span> call in a similar way.</p>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The reference that the non-Moose class uses as its instance type
      <b>must</b> match the instance type that Moose is using. Moose's default
      instance type is a hashref, but other modules exist to make Moose use
      other instance types. MooseX::InsideOut is the most general solution - it
      should work with any class. For globref-based classes in particular,
      MooseX::GlobRef will also allow Moose to work. For more information, see
      the <span class="Li">&quot;032-moosex-insideout&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;033-moosex-globref&quot;</span> tests bundled with
      this dist.</li>
  <li>Modifying your class' <span class="Li">@ISA</span> after an initial
      <span class="Li">&quot;extends&quot;</span> call will potentially cause
      problems if any of those new entries in the <span class="Li">@ISA</span>
      override the constructor.
      <span class="Li">&quot;MooseX::NonMoose&quot;</span> wraps the nearest
      <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span> method at the time
      <span class="Li">&quot;extends&quot;</span> is called and will not see any
      other <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span> methods in the
      <span class="Li">@ISA</span> hierarchy.</li>
  <li>Completely overriding the constructor in a class using
      <span class="Li">&quot;MooseX::NonMoose&quot;</span> (i.e. using
      <span class="Li">&quot;sub new { ... }&quot;</span>) currently doesn't
      work, although using method modifiers on the constructor should work
      identically to normal Moose classes.</li>
