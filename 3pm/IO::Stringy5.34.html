<p class="Pp">This toolkit primarily provides modules for performing both
    traditional and object-oriented i/o) on things <i>other</i> than normal
    filehandles; in particular, IO::Scalar, IO::ScalarArray, and IO::Lines.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the more-traditional IO::Handle front, we have IO::AtomicFile
    which may be used to painlessly create files which are updated
  atomically.</p>
<p class="Pp">And in the &quot;this-may-prove-useful&quot; corner, we have
    IO::Wrap, whose exported <b>wraphandle()</b> function will clothe anything
    that's not a blessed object in an IO::Handle-like wrapper... so you can just
    use OO syntax and stop worrying about whether your function's caller handed
    you a string, a globref, or a FileHandle.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="WARNINGS"><a class="permalink" href="#WARNINGS">WARNINGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Perl's TIEHANDLE spec was incomplete prior to 5.005_57; it was
    missing support for <span class="Li">&quot;seek()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;tell()&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;eof()&quot;</span>. Attempting to use these functions
    with an IO::Scalar, IO::ScalarArray, IO::Lines, etc. <b>will not work</b>
    prior to 5.005_57. None of the relevant methods will be invoked by Perl; and
    even worse, this kind of bug can lie dormant for a while. If you turn
    warnings on (via <span class="Li">$^W</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;perl
    -w&quot;</span>), and you see something like this...</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    seek() on unopened file
</pre>
<p class="Pp">...then you are probably trying to use one of these functions on
    one of our IO:: classes with an old Perl. The remedy is to simply use the OO
    version; e.g.:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $SH-&gt;seek(0,0);    ### GOOD: will work on any 5.005
    seek($SH,0,0);     ### WARNING: will only work on 5.005_57 and beyond

<h2 class="Ss" id="Requirements"><a class="permalink" href="#Requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As of version 2.x, this toolkit requires Perl 5.005 for the
    IO::Handle subclasses, and 5.005_57 or better is <b>strongly</b>
    recommended. See &quot;WARNINGS&quot; for details.</p>

<pre>    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

</pre>
<p class="Pp">For everyone else out there... if you've never installed Perl code
    before, or you're trying to use this in an environment where your sysadmin
    or ISP won't let you do interesting things, <b>relax:</b> since this module
    contains no binary extensions, you can cheat. That means copying the
    directory tree under my &quot;./lib&quot; directory into someplace where
    your script can &quot;see&quot; it. For example, under Linux:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    cp -r IO-stringy-1.234/lib/* /path/to/my/perl/
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now, in your Perl code, do this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use lib &quot;/path/to/my/perl&quot;;
    use IO::Scalar;                   ### or whatever
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Ok, now you've been told. At this point, anyone who whines about
    not being given enough information gets an unflattering haiku written about
    them in the next change log. I'll do it. Don't think I won't.</p>

  <dt>(2000/08/02) Finalize $/ support</dt>
  <dd>Graham Barr submitted this patch half a <i>year</i> ago; Like a moron, I
      lost his message under a ton of others, and only now have the experimental
      implementation done.
    <p class="Pp">Will the sudden sensitivity to $/ hose anyone out there? I'm

      <b>new_tie()</b> be identical to <b>new()</b>. Heck, I'll bet that
      IO::WrapTie should be reimplemented so the returned object is just like an
      IO::Scalar in its use of globrefs.</dd>

  <dt id="Version~5"><a class="permalink" href="#Version~5">Version 2.103
    (2001/08/08)</a></dt>
  <dd>After sober consideration I have reimplemented <b>IO::Scalar::print()</b>
      so that it once again always seeks to the end of the string. Benchmarks
      show the new implementation to be just as fast as Juergen's contributed
      patch; until someone can convince me otherwise, the current, safer
      implementation stays.
    <p class="Pp">I thought more about giving IO::Scalar two separate handles,
        one for reading and one for writing, as suggested by Binkley. His points
        about what <b>tell()</b> and <b>eof()</b> return are, I think,
        show-stoppers for this feature. Even the manpages for stdio's
        <b>fseek()</b> seem to imply a <i>single</i> file position indicator,
        not two. So I think I will take this off the TO DO list. <b>Remedy:</b>
        you can always have two handles open on the same scalar, one which you
        only write to, and one which you only read from. That should give the
        same effect.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Version~6"><a class="permalink" href="#Version~6">Version 2.101
    (2001/08/07)</a></dt>
  <dd><b>Alpha release.</b> This is the initial release of the &quot;IO::Scalar
      and friends are now subclasses of IO::Handle&quot;. I'm flinging it
      against the wall. Please tell me if the banana sticks. When it does, the
      banana will be called 2.2x.
    <p class="Pp">First off, <i>many many thanks to Doug Wilson</i>, who has
        provided an <i>invaluable</i> service by patching IO::Scalar and friends
        so that they (1) inherit from IO::Handle, (2) automatically tie
        themselves so that the <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span> objects
        can be used in native i/o constructs, and (3) doing it so that the whole
        damn thing passes its regression tests. As Doug knows, my globref
        Kung-Fu was not up to the task; he graciously provided the patches. This
        has earned him a seat at the Co-Authors table, and the right to have me
        address him as <i>sensei</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Performance of <b>IO::Scalar::print()</b> has been improved by
        as much as 2x for lots of little prints, with the cost of forcing those
        who print-then-seek-then-print to explicitly seek to end-of-string
        before printing again. <i>Thanks to Juergen Zeller for this
      patch.</i></p>
    <p class="Pp">Added the COPYING file, which had been missing from prior
        versions. <i>Thanks to Albert Chin-A-Young for pointing this
      out.</i></p>
    <p class="Pp">IO::Scalar consults $/ by default (1.x ignored it by default).
        Yes, I still need to support IO::ScalarArray.</p>

      problem apparently isn't surfacing now. If you suddenly encounter Perl
      warnings during global destruction (especially if you're using tied
