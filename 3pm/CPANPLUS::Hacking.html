<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This document attempts to describe how to develop with the
    CPANPLUS environment most easily, how certain things work and why.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is basically a quick-start guide to people who want to add
    features or patches to CPANPLUS.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OBTAINING_CPANPLUS"><a class="permalink" href="#OBTAINING_CPANPLUS">OBTAINING
  CPANPLUS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Checkout CPANPLUS from its GIT repository at
    &lt;https://github.com/jib/cpanplus-devel&gt; .</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INSTALLING_CPANPLUS"><a class="permalink" href="#INSTALLING_CPANPLUS">INSTALLING
  CPANPLUS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">CPANPLUS follows the standard perl module installation
  process:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURING_CPANPLUS"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURING_CPANPLUS">CONFIGURING
  CPANPLUS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When running <span class="Li">&quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot;</span>
    you will be prompted to configure. If you have already done so, and merely
    wish to update the <span class="Li">&quot;Makefile&quot;</span>, simply
  run:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL JFDI=1
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will keep your configuration intact. Note however, if there
    are changes to the default configuration file
    <span class="Li">&quot;Config.pm-orig&quot;</span>, you should either delete
    your current config file and reconfigure, or patch your config file from the
    new entries in <span class="Li">&quot;Config.pm-orig&quot;</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RUNNING_CPANPLUS_FROM_DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#RUNNING_CPANPLUS_FROM_DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT">RUNNING
  CPANPLUS FROM DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If you'd rather not install the development version to your
    <span class="Li">&quot;site_perl&quot;</span> directory, that's no problem.
    You can set your <span class="Li">&quot;PERL5LIB&quot;</span> environment
    variable to CPANPLUS' <span class="Li">&quot;lib&quot;</span> directory, and
    you can run it from there.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RUNNING_CPANPLUS_TESTS"><a class="permalink" href="#RUNNING_CPANPLUS_TESTS">RUNNING
  CPANPLUS TESTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Tests are what tells us if CPANPLUS is working. If a test is not
    working, try to run it explicitly like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    perl -I/path/to/cpanplus/lib t/XX_name_of_test.t 1
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The extra '1' makes sure that all the messages and errors (they
    might be errors we're testing for!) are being printed rather than kept
    quiet. This is a great way to find out the context of any failures that may
    occur.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe this test failure proves a bug in CPANPLUS, the
    long output of the test file is something we'd like to see alongside your
    bug report.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FINDING_BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#FINDING_BUGS">FINDING
  BUGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes you might find bugs in CPANPLUS' behaviour. If you
    encounter these in a development snapshot, we'd appreciate a complete patch
    (as described below in the &quot;SENDING PATCHES&quot; section.</p>
<p class="Pp">If it's way over your head, then of course reporting the bug is
    always better than not reporting it at all. Before you do so though, make
    sure you have the <b>latest</b> development snapshot, and the bug still
    persists there. If so, report the bug to this address:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    bug-cpanplus@rt.cpan.org
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A good <span class="Li">&quot;patch&quot;</span> would have the
    following characteristics:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Problem"><a class="permalink" href="#Problem">Problem
    description</a></dt>
  <dd>Describe clearly what the bug is you found, and what it should have done
      instead.</dd>
  <dt id="Program"><a class="permalink" href="#Program">Program demonstrating
    the bug</a></dt>
  <dd>Show us how to reproduce the bug, in a simple of a program as
    possible</dd>
  <dt>[OPTIONAL] A patch to the test suite to test for the bug</dt>
  <dd>Amend our test suite by making sure this bug will be found in this, and
      future versions of CPANPLUS (see &quot;SUPPLYING PATCHES&quot;)</dd>
  <dt>[OPTIONAL] A patch to the code + tests + documentation</dt>
  <dd>Fix the bug, update the docs &amp; tests. That way your bug will be gone
      forever :)</dd>
</dl>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SUPPLYING_PATCHES"><a class="permalink" href="#SUPPLYING_PATCHES">SUPPLYING
  PATCHES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Patches are a good thing, and they are welcome. Especially if they
    fix bugs you've found along the way, or that others have reported.</p>
<p class="Pp">We prefer patches in the following format:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>In <span class="Li">&quot;diff -u&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;diff -c&quot;</span> format</li>
  <li>From the root of the snapshot</li>
  <li>Including patches for code + tests + docs</li>
  <li>Sent per mail to bug-cpanplus@rt.cpan.org</li>
  <li>With subject containing <span class="Li">&quot;[PATCH]&quot;</span> +
      description of the patch</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">You will always be informed if a patch is applied or rejected, and
    in case of rejection why that is (perhaps you can tweak the patch to have it
    accepted after all).</p>
