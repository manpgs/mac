  <dt>&quot;-&gt;broadcast()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns a new object referring to the broadcast address of a given subnet.
      The broadcast address has all ones in all the bit positions where the
      netmask has zero bits. This is normally used to address all the hosts in a
      given subnet.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;network()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns a new object referring to the network address of a given subnet. A
      network address has all zero bits where the bits of the netmask are zero.
      Normally this is used to refer to a subnet.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;addr()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns a scalar with the address part of the object as an IPv4 or IPv6
      text string as appropriate. This is useful for printing or for passing the
      address part of the NetAddr::IP object to other components that expect an
      IP address. If the object is an ipV6 address or was created using
      -&gt;new6($ip) it will be reported in ipV6 hex format otherwise it will be
      reported in dot quad format only if it resides in ipV4 address space.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;mask()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns a scalar with the mask as an IPv4 or IPv6 text string as described
      above.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;masklen()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns a scalar the number of one bits in the mask.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;bits()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns the width of the address in bits. Normally 32 for v4 and 128 for
      v6.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;version()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns the version of the address or subnet. Currently this can be either
      4 or 6.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;cidr()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns a scalar with the address and mask in CIDR notation. A NetAddr::IP
      object <i>stringifies</i> to the result of this function. (see comments
      about -&gt;<b>new6()</b> and -&gt;<b>addr()</b> for output formats)</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;aton()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns the address part of the NetAddr::IP object in the same format as

      <span class="Li">&quot;ipv6_aton&quot;</span> function respectively. If

      always be in ipV6 format, even for addresses in ipV4 address space.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;range()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns a scalar with the base address and the broadcast address separated
      by a dash and spaces. This is called range notation.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;prefix()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns a scalar with the address and mask in ipV4 prefix representation.
      This is useful for some programs, which expect its input to be in this
      format. This method will include the broadcast address in the
    encoding.</dd>

      include the broadcast address.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;numeric()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>When called in a scalar context, will return a numeric representation of
      the address part of the IP address. When called in an array contest, it
