<p class="Pp">Let's start with a bit of history: Perl 5.6.0 introduced Unicode
    support. You could apply <span class="Li">&quot;substr()&quot;</span> and
    regexes even to complex CJK characters -- so long as the script was written
    in UTF-8. But back then, text editors that supported UTF-8 were still rare
    and many users instead chose to write scripts in legacy encodings, giving up
    a whole new feature of Perl 5.6.</p>
<p class="Pp">Rewind to the future: starting from perl 5.8.0 with the
    <b>encoding</b> pragma, you can write your script in any encoding you like
    (so long as the <span class="Li">&quot;Encode&quot;</span> module supports
    it) and still enjoy Unicode support. This pragma achieves that by doing the
    following:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Internally converts all literals
      (<span class="Li">&quot;q//,qq//,qr//,qw///, qx//&quot;</span>) from the
      encoding specified to utf8. In Perl 5.8.1 and later, literals in
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;DATA&quot;</span> pseudo-filehandle are also
      converted.</li>
  <li>Changing PerlIO layers of <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span> to the encoding
    <br/>
     specified.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Literal_Conversions"><a class="permalink" href="#Literal_Conversions">Literal

<p class="Pp">You can write code in EUC-JP as follows:</p>

               #&lt;-char-&gt;&lt;-char-&gt;   # 4 octets
  s/\bCamel\b/$Rakuda/;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And with <span class="Li">&quot;use encoding
    &quot;euc-jp&quot;&quot;</span> in effect, it is the same thing as the code
    in UTF-8:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<p class="Pp">The <b>encoding</b> pragma also modifies the filehandle layers of

    with Unicode character data are concatenated, the new string will be created
    by decoding the byte strings as <i>ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1)</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>encoding</b> pragma changes this to use the specified
    encoding instead. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use encoding 'utf8';
    my $string = chr(20000); # a Unicode string
    utf8::encode($string);   # now it's a UTF-8 encoded byte string

</pre>
<p class="Pp">Will print <span class="Li">2</span>, because
    <span class="Li">$string</span> is upgraded as UTF-8. Without
    <span class="Li">&quot;use encoding 'utf8';&quot;</span>, it will print
    <span class="Li">4</span> instead, since <span class="Li">$string</span> is
    three octets when interpreted as Latin-1.</p>

<p class="Pp">The magic of <span class="Li">&quot;use encoding&quot;</span> is

    where human is a single Han ideograph) work, you still need to write your
    script in UTF-8 -- or use a source filter. That's what 'Filter=&gt;1'
  does.</p>
<p class="Pp">What does this mean? Your source code behaves as if it is written
    in UTF-8 with 'use utf8' in effect. So even if your editor only supports
    Shift_JIS, for example, you can still try examples in Chapter 15 of
    <span class="Li">&quot;Programming Perl, 3rd Ed.&quot;</span>. For instance,
    you can use UTF-8 identifiers.</p>
<p class="Pp">This option is significantly slower and (as of this writing)

    <span class="Li">&quot;no encoding&quot;</span> matters, and it affects
    <b>the whole script</b>. However, the &lt;no encoding&gt; pragma is
    supported and <b>use encoding</b> can appear as many times as you want in a

<p class="Pp">By the same reason, the use this pragma inside modules is also
    discouraged (though not as strongly discouraged as the case above. See

<p class="Pp">If you still have to write a module with this pragma, be very

    GREEK SMALL LETTER IOTA WITH TONOS) on the left will <b>not</b> be upgraded

    IOTA WITH TONOS) because of the <span class="Li">&quot;\x{100}&quot;</span>
    on the left. You should not be mixing your legacy data and Unicode in the
    same string.</p>
<p class="Pp">This pragma also affects encoding of the 0x80..0xFF code point
    range: normally characters in that range are left as eight-bit bytes (unless
    they are combined with characters with code points 0x100 or larger, in which
    case all characters need to become UTF-8 encoded), but if the
    <span class="Li">&quot;encoding&quot;</span> pragma is present, even the

<p class="Pp">After all, the best thing about this pragma is that you don't have
