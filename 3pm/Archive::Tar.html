<p class="Pp">Archive::Tar provides an object oriented mechanism for handling
    tar files. It provides class methods for quick and easy files handling while
    also allowing for the creation of tar file objects for custom manipulation.
    If you have the IO::Zlib module installed, Archive::Tar will also support
    compressed or gzipped tar files.</p>
<p class="Pp">An object of class Archive::Tar represents a .tar(.gz) archive
    full of files and things.</p>

  Methods</a></h1>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Archive::Tar-&gt;new( [$file, $compressed] )</h2>
<p class="Pp">Returns a new Tar object. If given any arguments,
    <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span> calls the
    <span class="Li">&quot;read()&quot;</span> method automatically, passing on
    the arguments provided to the <span class="Li">&quot;read()&quot;</span>
    method.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span> is invoked with
    arguments and the <span class="Li">&quot;read()&quot;</span> method fails
    for any reason, <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span> returns undef.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;read ( $filename|$handle, [$compressed, {opt =&gt;
  'val'}] )</h2>
<p class="Pp">Read the given tar file into memory. The first argument can either
    be the name of a file or a reference to an already open filehandle (or an
    IO::Zlib object if it's compressed)</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;read&quot;</span> will <i>replace</i>
    any previous content in <span class="Li">$tar</span>!</p>
<p class="Pp">The second argument may be considered optional, but remains for
    backwards compatibility. Archive::Tar now looks at the file magic to
    determine what class should be used to open the file and will transparently
    Do The Right Thing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Archive::Tar will warn if you try to pass a bzip2 / xz compressed
    file and the IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2 / IO::Uncompress::UnXz are not
    available and simply return.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that you can currently <b>not</b> pass a
    <span class="Li">&quot;gzip&quot;</span> compressed filehandle, which is not
    opened with <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Zlib&quot;</span>, a
    <span class="Li">&quot;bzip2&quot;</span> compressed filehandle, which is
    not opened with <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Uncompress::Bunzip2&quot;</span>,
    a <span class="Li">&quot;xz&quot;</span> compressed filehandle, which is not
    opened with <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Uncompress::UnXz&quot;</span>, nor a
    string containing the full archive information (either compressed or
    uncompressed). These are worth while features, but not currently
    implemented. See the <span class="Li">&quot;TODO&quot;</span> section.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third argument can be a hash reference with options. Note that
    all options are case-sensitive.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="limit"><a class="permalink" href="#limit">limit</a></dt>
  <dd>Do not read more than <span class="Li">&quot;limit&quot;</span> files.
      This is useful if you have very big archives, and are only interested in
      the first few files.</dd>
  <dt id="filter"><a class="permalink" href="#filter">filter</a></dt>
  <dd>Can be set to a regular expression. Only files with names that match the
      expression will be read.</dd>
  <dt id="md5"><a class="permalink" href="#md5">md5</a></dt>
  <dd>Set to 1 and the md5sum of files will be returned (instead of file data)
    <br/>
     my <span class="Li">$iter</span> = Archive::Tar-&gt;iter(
      <span class="Li">$file</span>, 1, {md5 =&gt; 1} );
    <br/>
     while( my <span class="Li">$f</span> = <span class="Li">$iter</span>-&gt;()
      ) {
    <br/>
     print <span class="Li">$f</span>-&gt;data . &quot;\t&quot; .
      <span class="Li">$f</span>-&gt;full_path . $/;
    <br/>
     }</dd>
  <dt id="extract"><a class="permalink" href="#extract">extract</a></dt>
  <dd>If set to true, immediately extract entries when reading them. This gives
      you the same memory break as the
      <span class="Li">&quot;extract_archive&quot;</span> function. Note however
      that entries will not be read into memory, but written straight to disk.
      This means no <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar::File&quot;</span>
      objects are created for you to inspect.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">All files are stored internally as
    <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar::File&quot;</span> objects. Please
    consult the Archive::Tar::File documentation for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the number of files read in scalar context, and a list of
    <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar::File&quot;</span> objects in list
    context.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;contains_file( $filename )</h2>
<p class="Pp">Check if the archive contains a certain file. It will return true
    if the file is in the archive, false otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note however, that this function does an exact match using
    <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> on the full path. So it cannot
    compensate for case-insensitive file- systems or compare 2 paths to see if
    they would point to the same underlying file.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;extract( [@filenames] )</h2>
<p class="Pp">Write files whose names are equivalent to any of the names in
    <span class="Li">@filenames</span> to disk, creating subdirectories as
    necessary. This might not work too well under VMS. Under MacPerl, the file's
    modification time will be converted to the MacOS zero of time, and
    appropriate conversions will be done to the path. However, the length of
    each element of the path is not inspected to see whether it's longer than
    MacOS currently allows (32 characters).</p>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;extract&quot;</span> is called without a
    list of file names, the entire contents of the archive are extracted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Returns a list of filenames extracted.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;extract_file( $file, [$extract_path] )</h2>
<p class="Pp">Write an entry, whose name is equivalent to the file name provided
    to disk. Optionally takes a second parameter, which is the full native path
    (including filename) the entry will be written to.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $tar-&gt;extract_file( 'name/in/archive', 'name/i/want/to/give/it' );
    $tar-&gt;extract_file( $at_file_object,   'name/i/want/to/give/it' );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Returns true on success, false on failure.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;list_files( [\@properties] )</h2>
<p class="Pp">Returns a list of the names of all the files in the archive.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;list_files()&quot;</span> is passed an
    array reference as its first argument it returns a list of hash references
    containing the requested properties of each file. The following list of
    properties is supported: name, size, mtime (last modified date), mode, uid,
    gid, linkname, uname, gname, devmajor, devminor, prefix.</p>
<p class="Pp">Passing an array reference containing only one element, 'name', is
    special cased to return a list of names rather than a list of hash
    references, making it equivalent to calling
    <span class="Li">&quot;list_files&quot;</span> without arguments.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;get_files( [@filenames] )</h2>
<p class="Pp">Returns the <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar::File&quot;</span>
    objects matching the filenames provided. If no filename list was passed, all
    <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar::File&quot;</span> objects in the
    current Tar object are returned.</p>
<p class="Pp">Please refer to the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar::File&quot;</span> documentation on how
    to handle these objects.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;get_content( $file )</h2>
<p class="Pp">Return the content of the named file.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;replace_content( $file, $content )</h2>
<p class="Pp">Make the string <span class="Li">$content</span> be the content
    for the file named <span class="Li">$file</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;rename( $file, $new_name )</h2>
<p class="Pp">Rename the file of the in-memory archive to
    <span class="Li">$new_name</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that you must specify a Unix path for
    <span class="Li">$new_name</span>, since per tar standard, all files in the
    archive must be Unix paths.</p>
<p class="Pp">Returns true on success and false on failure.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;chmod( $file, $mode )</h2>
<p class="Pp">Change mode of <span class="Li">$file</span> to
    <span class="Li">$mode</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Returns true on success and false on failure.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;chown( $file, $uname [, $gname] )</h2>
<p class="Pp">Change owner <span class="Li">$file</span> to
    <span class="Li">$uname</span> and <span class="Li">$gname</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Returns true on success and false on failure.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;remove (@filenamelist)</h2>
<p class="Pp">Removes any entries with names matching any of the given filenames
    from the in-memory archive. Returns a list of
    <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar::File&quot;</span> objects that
  remain.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="$tar"><a class="permalink" href="#$tar">$tar-&gt;clear</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;clear&quot;</span> clears the current
    in-memory archive. This effectively gives you a 'blank' object, ready to be
    filled again. Note that <span class="Li">&quot;clear&quot;</span> only has
    effect on the object, not the underlying tarfile.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;write ( [$file, $compressed, $prefix] )</h2>
<p class="Pp">Write the in-memory archive to disk. The first argument can either
    be the name of a file or a reference to an already open filehandle (a GLOB
    reference).</p>
<p class="Pp">The second argument is used to indicate compression. You can
    compress using <span class="Li">&quot;gzip&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;bzip2&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;xz&quot;</span>. If you pass a digit, it's assumed to
    be the <span class="Li">&quot;gzip&quot;</span> compression level (between 1
    and 9), but the use of constants is preferred:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  # write a gzip compressed file
  $tar-&gt;write( 'out.tgz', COMPRESS_GZIP );
  # write a bzip compressed file
  $tar-&gt;write( 'out.tbz', COMPRESS_BZIP );
  # write a xz compressed file
  $tar-&gt;write( 'out.txz', COMPRESS_XZ );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that when you pass in a filehandle, the compression argument
    is ignored, as all files are printed verbatim to your filehandle. If you
    wish to enable compression with filehandles, use an
    <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Zlib&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Compress::Bzip2&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Compress::Xz&quot;</span> filehandle instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third argument is an optional prefix. All files will be tucked
    away in the directory you specify as prefix. So if you have files 'a' and
    'b' in your archive, and you specify 'foo' as prefix, they will be written
    to the archive as 'foo/a' and 'foo/b'.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no arguments are given,
    <span class="Li">&quot;write&quot;</span> returns the entire formatted
    archive as a string, which could be useful if you'd like to stuff the
    archive into a socket or a pipe to gzip or something.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;add_files( @filenamelist )</h2>
<p class="Pp">Takes a list of filenames and adds them to the in-memory
  archive.</p>
<p class="Pp">The path to the file is automatically converted to a Unix like
    equivalent for use in the archive, and, if on MacOS, the file's modification
    time is converted from the MacOS epoch to the Unix epoch. So tar archives
    created on MacOS with <b>Archive::Tar</b> can be read both with <i>tar</i>
    on Unix and applications like <i>suntar</i> or <i>Stuffit Expander</i> on
    MacOS.</p>
<p class="Pp">Be aware that the file's type/creator and resource fork will be
    lost, which is usually what you want in cross-platform archives.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of a filename, you can also pass it an existing
    <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar::File&quot;</span> object from, for
    example, another archive. The object will be clone, and effectively be a
    copy of the original, not an alias.</p>
<p class="Pp">Returns a list of
    <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar::File&quot;</span> objects that were
    just added.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;add_data ( $filename, $data, [$opthashref] )</h2>
<p class="Pp">Takes a filename, a scalar full of data and optionally a reference
    to a hash with specific options.</p>
<p class="Pp">Will add a file to the in-memory archive, with name
    <span class="Li">$filename</span> and content <span class="Li">$data</span>.
    Specific properties can be set using <span class="Li">$opthashref</span>.
    The following list of properties is supported: name, size, mtime (last
    modified date), mode, uid, gid, linkname, uname, gname, devmajor, devminor,
    prefix, type. (On MacOS, the file's path and modification times are
    converted to Unix equivalents.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Valid values for the file type are the following constants defined
    by Archive::Tar::Constant:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="FILE"><a class="permalink" href="#FILE">FILE</a></dt>
  <dd>Regular file.</dd>
  <dt id="HARDLINK"><a class="permalink" href="#HARDLINK">HARDLINK</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="SYMLINK"><a class="permalink" href="#SYMLINK">SYMLINK</a></dt>

  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="BLOCKDEV"><a class="permalink" href="#BLOCKDEV">BLOCKDEV</a></dt>

</dl>
<p class="Pp">Returns the <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar::File&quot;</span>
    object that was just added, or <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> on
    failure.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;error( [$BOOL] )</h2>
<p class="Pp">Returns the current error string (usually, the last error
    reported). If a true value was specified, it will give the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Carp::longmess&quot;</span> equivalent of the error,
    in effect giving you a stacktrace.</p>
<p class="Pp">For backwards compatibility, this error is also available as
    <span class="Li">$Archive::Tar::error</span> although it is much recommended
    you use the method call instead.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">$tar-&gt;setcwd( $cwd );</h2>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar&quot;</span> needs to know the
    current directory, and it will run
    <span class="Li">&quot;Cwd::cwd()&quot;</span> <i>every</i> time it extracts
    a <i>relative</i> entry from the tarfile and saves it in the file system.
    (As of version 1.30, however,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar&quot;</span> will use the speed
    optimization described below automatically, so it's only relevant if you're
    using <span class="Li">&quot;extract_file()&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Since <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar&quot;</span> doesn't
    change the current directory internally while it is extracting the items in
    a tarball, all calls to <span class="Li">&quot;Cwd::cwd()&quot;</span> can
    be avoided if we can guarantee that the current directory doesn't get
    changed externally.</p>
<p class="Pp">To use this performance boost, set the current directory via</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use Cwd;
    $tar-&gt;setcwd( cwd() );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">once before calling a function like
    <span class="Li">&quot;extract_file&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar&quot;</span> will use the current
    directory setting from then on and won't call
    <span class="Li">&quot;Cwd::cwd()&quot;</span> internally.</p>
<p class="Pp">To switch back to the default behaviour, use</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $tar-&gt;setcwd( undef );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar&quot;</span> will call

<p class="Pp">If you're using <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar&quot;</span>'s
    <span class="Li">&quot;extract()&quot;</span> method,

  <dd>Yes it is. It's pure perl, so it's a lot slower then your

      If speed is an issue, consider using

  <dt id="Isn't~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Isn't~2">Isn't Archive::Tar

      <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Zlib&quot;</span> doesn't support

      little choice but to read the archive into memory. This is ok if you want
      to do in-memory manipulation of the archive.
    <p class="Pp">If you just want to extract, use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;extract_archive&quot;</span> class method
        instead. It will optimize and write to disk immediately.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Another option is to use the

  <dt id="How"><a class="permalink" href="#How">How much memory will an X kb tar

        from a tarball. Using <span class="Li">&quot;get_content()&quot;</span>
        on the <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar::File&quot;</span> object
        will return its content as a bytestring, not as a Unicode string.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you want it to be a Unicode string (because you want
        character semantics with operations like regular expression matching),
        you need to decode the UTF8-encoded content and have Perl convert it
        into a Unicode string:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Encode;
    my $data = $tar-&gt;get_content();
    # Make it a Unicode string
    $data = decode('utf8', $data);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">There is no easy way to provide this functionality in
        <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar&quot;</span>, because a tarball can
        contain many files, and each of which could be encoded in a different
        way.</p>

<p class="Pp">The AIX tar does not fill all unused space in the tar archive with
    0x00. This sometimes leads to warning messages from
    <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar&quot;</span>.</p>

<pre>  Invalid header block at offset nnn

<p class="Pp">A fix for that problem is scheduled to be released in the
