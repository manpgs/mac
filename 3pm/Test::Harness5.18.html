<p class="Pp">Although, for historical reasons, the Test::Harness distribution
    takes its name from this module it now exists only to provide TAP::Harness
    with an interface that is somewhat backwards compatible with Test::Harness
    2.xx. If you're writing new code consider using TAP::Harness directly
    instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Emulation is provided for
    <span class="Li">&quot;runtests&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;execute_tests&quot;</span> but the pluggable 'Straps'
    interface that previous versions of Test::Harness supported is not
    reproduced here. Straps is now available as a stand alone module:
    Test::Harness::Straps.</p>
<p class="Pp">See TAP::Parser, TAP::Harness for the main documentation for this
    distribution.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="FUNCTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The following functions are available.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="runtests(_@test_files_)"><a class="permalink" href="#runtests(_@test_files_)">runtests(
  @test_files )</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This runs all the given <i></i><i>@test_files</i><i></i> and
    divines whether they passed or failed based on their output to STDOUT
    (details above). It prints out each individual test which failed along with
    a summary report and a how long it all took.</p>
<p class="Pp">It returns true if everything was ok. Otherwise it will
    <span class="Li">&quot;die()&quot;</span> with one of the messages in the
    DIAGNOSTICS section.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="execute_tests(_tests_=__"><a class="permalink" href="#execute_tests(_tests_=__">execute_tests(
  tests =&gt; \@test_files, out =&gt; \*FH )</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Runs all the given <span class="Li">@test_files</span> (just like
    <span class="Li">&quot;runtests()&quot;</span>) but doesn't generate the
    final report. During testing, progress information will be written to the
    currently selected output filehandle (usually
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span>), or to the filehandle given by
    the <span class="Li">&quot;out&quot;</span> parameter. The <i>out</i> is
    optional.</p>
<p class="Pp">Returns a list of two values, <span class="Li">$total</span> and
    <span class="Li">$failed</span>, describing the results.
    <span class="Li">$total</span> is a hash ref summary of all the tests run.
    Its keys and values are this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    bonus           Number of individual todo tests unexpectedly passed
    max             Number of individual tests ran
    ok              Number of individual tests passed
    sub_skipped     Number of individual tests skipped
    todo            Number of individual todo tests

    files           Number of test files ran
    good            Number of test files passed
    bad             Number of test files failed
    tests           Number of test files originally given
    skipped         Number of test files skipped
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;$total-&gt;{bad} == 0&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;$total-&gt;{max} &gt; 0&quot;</span>, you've got a
    successful test.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$failed</span> is a hash ref of all the test
    scripts that failed. Each key is the name of a test script, each value is
    another hash representing how that script failed. Its keys are these:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    name        Name of the test which failed
    estat       Script's exit value
    wstat       Script's wait status
    max         Number of individual tests
    failed      Number which failed
    canon       List of tests which failed (as string).
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$failed</span> should be empty if everything
    passed.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;HARNESS_TIMER&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Setting this to true will make the harness display the number of
      milliseconds each test took. You can also use <i>prove</i>'s
      <span class="Li">&quot;--timer&quot;</span> switch.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;HARNESS_VERBOSE&quot;</dt>
  <dd>If true, <span class="Li">&quot;Test::Harness&quot;</span> will output the
      verbose results of running its tests. Setting
      <span class="Li">$Test::Harness::verbose</span> will override this, or you
      can use the <span class="Li">&quot;-v&quot;</span> switch in the
      <i>prove</i> utility.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;HARNESS_OPTIONS&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Provide additional options to the harness. Currently supported options
      are:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;j&lt;n&gt;&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Run &lt;n&gt; (default 9) parallel jobs.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;c&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Try to color output. See &quot;new&quot; in TAP::Formatter::Base.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;a&lt;file.tgz&gt;&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Will use TAP::Harness::Archive as the harness class, and save the TAP to
      <span class="Li">&quot;file.tgz&quot;</span></dd>
  <dt>&quot;fPackage-With-Dashes&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Set the formatter_class of the harness being run. Since the
      <span class="Li">&quot;HARNESS_OPTIONS&quot;</span> is seperated by

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Taint_Mode"><a class="permalink" href="#Taint_Mode">Taint
  Mode</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Normally when a Perl program is run in taint mode the contents of
    the <span class="Li">&quot;PERL5LIB&quot;</span> environment variable do not
    appear in <span class="Li">@INC</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because <span class="Li">&quot;PERL5LIB&quot;</span> is often used
    during testing to add build directories to <span class="Li">@INC</span>
    <span class="Li">&quot;Test::Harness&quot;</span> passes the names of any
    directories found in <span class="Li">&quot;PERL5LIB&quot;</span> as -I
    switches. The net effect of this is that
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL5LIB&quot;</span> is honoured even in taint
  mode.</p>

    Either Tim Bunce or Andreas Koenig, we don't know. What we know for
    sure is, that it was inspired by Larry Wall's F&lt;TEST&gt; script that came
    with perl distributions for ages. Numerous anonymous contributors
    exist.  Andreas Koenig held the torch for many years, and then
    Michael G Schwern.
