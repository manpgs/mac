<p class="Pp">The YAML specification is huge. Really, <b>really</b> huge. It
    contains all the functionality of XML, except with flexibility and choice,
    which makes it easier to read, but with a formal specification that is more
    complex than XML.</p>
<p class="Pp">The original pure-Perl implementation YAML costs just over 4
    megabytes of memory to load. Just like with Windows <i>.ini</i> files (3 meg
    to load) and CSS (3.5 meg to load) the situation is just asking for a
    <b>YAML::Tiny</b> module, an incomplete but correct and usable subset of the
    functionality, in as little code as possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">Like the other <span class="Li">&quot;::Tiny&quot;</span> modules,
    YAML::Tiny has no non-core dependencies, does not require a compiler to
    install, is back-compatible to Perl v5.8.1, and can be inlined into other
    modules if needed.</p>
<p class="Pp">In exchange for this adding this extreme flexibility, it provides
    support for only a limited subset of YAML. But the subset supported contains
    most of the features for the more common uses of YAML.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>YAML::Tiny</b> is a perl class for reading and writing
    YAML-style files, written with as little code as possible, reducing load
    time and memory overhead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most of the time it is accepted that Perl applications use a lot
    of memory and modules. The <b>::Tiny</b> family of modules is specifically
    intended to provide an ultralight and zero-dependency alternative to many
    more-thorough standard modules.</p>
<p class="Pp">This module is primarily for reading human-written files (like
    simple config files) and generating very simple human-readable files. Note
    that I said <b>human-readable</b> and not <b>geek-readable</b>. The sort of
    files that your average manager or secretary should be able to look at and
    make sense of.</p>
<p class="Pp">YAML::Tiny does not generate comments, it won't necessarily
    preserve the order of your hashes, and it will normalise if reading in and
    writing out again.</p>
<p class="Pp">It only supports a very basic subset of the full YAML
    specification.</p>
<p class="Pp">Usage is targeted at files like Perl's META.yml, for which a small
    and easily-embeddable module is extremely attractive.</p>
<p class="Pp">Features will only be added if they are human readable, and can be
    written in a few lines of code. Please don't be offended if your request is
    refused. Someone has to draw the line, and for YAML::Tiny that someone is
    me.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you need something with more power move up to YAML (7 megabytes
    of memory overhead) or YAML::XS (6 megabytes memory overhead and requires a
    C compiler).</p>
<p class="Pp">To restate, YAML::Tiny does <b>not</b> preserve your comments,
    whitespace, or the order of your YAML data. But it should round-trip from
    Perl structure to file and back again just fine.</p>

<p class="Pp">This section of the documentation provides a specification for

<p class="Pp">It is based on and described comparatively to the YAML 1.1 Working
    Draft 2004-12-28 specification, located at
    &lt;http://yaml.org/spec/current.html&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Terminology and chapter numbers are based on that
  specification.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="1._Introduction_and_Goals"><a class="permalink" href="#1._Introduction_and_Goals">1.
  Introduction and Goals</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The purpose of the YAML Tiny specification is to describe a useful
    subset of the YAML specification that can be used for typical
    document-oriented use cases such as configuration files and simple data
    structure dumps.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many specification elements that add flexibility or extensibility
    are intentionally removed, as is support for complex data structures, class
    and object-orientation.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, the YAML Tiny language targets only those data
    structures available in JSON, with the additional limitation that only
    simple keys are supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a result, all possible YAML Tiny documents should be able to be
    transformed into an equivalent JSON document, although the reverse is not
    necessarily true (but will be true in simple cases).</p>
<p class="Pp">As a result of these simplifications the YAML Tiny specification
    should be implementable in a (relatively) small amount of code in any
    language that supports Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="2._Introduction"><a class="permalink" href="#2._Introduction">2.
  Introduction</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">YAML Tiny supports three data structures. These are scalars (in a
    variety of forms), block-form sequences and block-form mappings. Flow-style
    sequences and mappings are not supported, with some minor exceptions
    detailed later.</p>
<p class="Pp">The use of three dashes &quot;---&quot; to indicate the start of a
    new document is supported, and multiple documents per file/stream is
    allowed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both line and inline comments are supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">Scalars are supported via the plain style, single quote and double
    quote, as well as literal-style and folded-style multi-line scalars.</p>
<p class="Pp">The use of explicit tags is not supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">The use of &quot;null&quot; type scalars is supported via the ~
    character.</p>
<p class="Pp">The use of &quot;bool&quot; type scalars is not supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, serializer implementations should take care to explicitly
    escape strings that match a &quot;bool&quot; keyword in the following set to
    prevent other implementations that do support &quot;bool&quot; accidentally
    reading a string as a boolean</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  y|Y|yes|Yes|YES|n|N|no|No|NO
  |true|True|TRUE|false|False|FALSE
  |on|On|ON|off|Off|OFF
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The use of anchors and aliases is not supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">The use of directives is supported only for the
    <span class="Li">%YAML</span> directive.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="3._Processing_"><a class="permalink" href="#3._Processing_">3.
  Processing YAML Tiny Information</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>Processes</b></p>
<p class="Pp">The YAML specification dictates three-phase serialization and
    three-phase deserialization.</p>
<p class="Pp">The YAML Tiny specification does not mandate any particular
    methodology or mechanism for parsing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any compliant parser is only required to parse a single document
    at a time. The ability to support streaming documents is optional and most
    likely non-typical.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because anchors and aliases are not supported, the resulting
    representation graph is thus directed but (unlike the main YAML
    specification) <b>acyclic</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Circular references/pointers are not possible, and any YAML Tiny
    serializer detecting a circular reference should error with an appropriate
    message.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Presentation Stream</b></p>
<p class="Pp">YAML Tiny reads and write UTF-8 encoded files. Operations on
    strings expect or produce Unicode characters not UTF-8 encoded bytes.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Loading Failure Points</b></p>
<p class="Pp">YAML Tiny parsers and emitters are not expected to recover from,
    or adapt to, errors. The specific error modality of any implementation is
    not dictated (return codes, exceptions, etc.) but is expected to be
    consistent.</p>

  Syntax</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>Character Set</b></p>
<p class="Pp">YAML Tiny streams are processed in memory as Unicode characters
    and read/written with UTF-8 encoding.</p>
<p class="Pp">The escaping and unescaping of the 8-bit YAML escapes is
  required.</p>
<p class="Pp">The escaping and unescaping of 16-bit and 32-bit YAML escapes is
    not required.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Indicator Characters</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Support for the &quot;~&quot; null/undefined indicator is

  required.</p>
<p class="Pp">Support for the &quot;&quot;&quot; double quote indicator is

<p class="Pp">Support for the &quot;%&quot; directive indicator is required, but
    only for the special case of a <span class="Li">%YAML</span> version
    directive before the &quot;---&quot; document header, or on the same line as
    the document header.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  %YAML 1.1
  ---
  - A sequence with a single element
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Special Exception:</p>
<p class="Pp">To provide the ability to support empty sequences and mappings,
    support for the constructs [] (empty sequence) and {} (empty mapping) are
    required.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  %YAML 1.1
  # A document consisting of only an empty mapping
  --- {}
  # A document consisting of only an empty sequence
  --- []
  # A document consisting of an empty mapping within a sequence
  - foo
  - {}
  - bar
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>Syntax Primitives</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Other than the empty sequence and mapping cases described above,
    YAML Tiny supports only the indentation-based block-style group of

<p class="Pp">All five scalar contexts are supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">Indentation spaces work as per the YAML specification in all

<p class="Pp">The only directive supported by the YAML Tiny specification is the
    <span class="Li">%YAML</span> language/version identifier. Although
    detected, this directive will have no control over the parsing itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">The parser must recognise both the YAML 1.0 and YAML 1.1+
    formatting of this directive (as well as the commented form, although no
    explicit code should be needed to deal with this case, being a comment
    anyway)</p>
<p class="Pp">That is, all of the following should be supported.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  --- #YAML:1.0
  - foo
  %YAML:1.0
  ---
  - foo
  % YAML 1.1
  ---
  - foo

<p class="Pp">Support for the <span class="Li">%TAG</span> directive is
    <b>not</b> required.</p>
<p class="Pp">Support for additional directives is <b>not</b> required.</p>
<p class="Pp">Support for the document boundary marker &quot;---&quot; is
    required.</p>
<p class="Pp">Support for the document boundary market &quot;...&quot; is
    <b>not</b> required.</p>
<p class="Pp">If necessary, a document boundary should simply by indicated with
    a &quot;---&quot; marker, with not preceding &quot;...&quot; marker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Support for empty streams (containing no documents) is
  required.</p>
<p class="Pp">Support for implicit document starts is required.</p>
<p class="Pp">That is, the following must be equivalent.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> # Full form
 %YAML 1.1
 ---
 foo: bar
 # Implicit form
 foo: bar
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>Nodes</b></p>

<p class="Pp">Support for block nodes is required.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Scalar Styles</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Support for all five scalar styles is required as per the YAML
    specification, although support for quoted scalars spanning more than one

<p class="Pp">For some Perl applications, it's important to know if you really
