<p class="Pp">Devel::Peek contains functions which allows raw Perl datatypes to
    be manipulated from a Perl script. This is used by those who do XS
    programming to check that the data they are sending from C to Perl looks as
    they think it should look. The trick, then, is to know what the raw datatype
    is supposed to look like when it gets to Perl. This document offers some
    tips and hints to describe good and bad raw data.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is very possible that this document will fall far short of
    being useful to the casual reader. The reader is expected to understand the
    material in the first few sections of perlguts.</p>
<p class="Pp">Devel::Peek supplies a <span class="Li">&quot;Dump()&quot;</span>
    function which can dump a raw Perl datatype, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;mstat(&quot;marker&quot;)&quot;</span> function to
    report on memory usage (if perl is compiled with corresponding option). The
    function <b>DeadCode()</b> provides statistics on the data
    &quot;frozen&quot; into inactive <span class="Li">&quot;CV&quot;</span>.
    Devel::Peek also supplies <span class="Li">&quot;SvREFCNT()&quot;</span>
    which can query reference counts on SVs. This document will take a passive,
    and safe, approach to data debugging and for that it will describe only the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Dump()&quot;</span> function.</p>
<p class="Pp">All output is to STDERR.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;Dump()&quot;</span> function takes one
    or two arguments: something to dump, and an optional limit for recursion and
    array elements (default is 4). The first argument is evaluted in rvalue
    scalar context, with exceptions for <span class="Li">@array</span> and
    <span class="Li">%hash</span>, which dump the array or hash itself. So
    <span class="Li">&quot;Dump @array&quot;</span> works, as does
    <span class="Li">&quot;Dump $foo&quot;</span>. And
    <span class="Li">&quot;Dump pos&quot;</span> will call
    <span class="Li">&quot;pos&quot;</span> in rvalue context, whereas
    <span class="Li">&quot;Dump ${\pos}&quot;</span> will call it in lvalue
    context.</p>
<p class="Pp">Function <span class="Li">&quot;DumpArray()&quot;</span> allows
    dumping of multiple values (useful when you need to analyze returns of
    functions).</p>
<p class="Pp">The global variable <span class="Li">$Devel::Peek::pv_limit</span>
    can be set to limit the number of character printed in various string
    values. Setting it to 0 means no limit.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;use Devel::Peek&quot;</span> directive
    has a <span class="Li">&quot;:opd=FLAGS&quot;</span> argument, this switches
    on debugging of opcode dispatch. <span class="Li">&quot;FLAGS&quot;</span>
    should be a combination of <span class="Li">&quot;s&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;t&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;P&quot;</span> (see <b>-D</b> flags in perlrun).</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;:opd&quot;</span> is a shortcut for
    <span class="Li">&quot;:opd=st&quot;</span>.</p>

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;CvGV($cv)&quot;</span> return one of the
    globs associated to a subroutine reference <span class="Li">$cv</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>debug_flags()</b> returns a string representation of
    <span class="Li">$^D</span> (similar to what is allowed for <b>-D</b> flag).
    When called with a numeric argument, sets $^D to the corresponding value.
    When called with an argument of the form
    <span class="Li">&quot;flags-flags&quot;</span>, set on/off bits of
    <span class="Li">$^D</span> corresponding to letters before/after
    <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span>. (The returned value is for
    <span class="Li">$^D</span> before the modification.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>runops_debug()</b> returns true if the current <i>opcode
    dispatcher</i> is the debugging one. When called with an argument, switches
    to debugging or non-debugging dispatcher depending on the argument (active
    for newly-entered subs/etc only). (The returned value is for the dispatcher
    before the modification.)</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Memory_footprint_debugging"><a class="permalink" href="#Memory_footprint_debugging">Memory
  footprint debugging</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When perl is compiled with support for memory footprint debugging
    (default with Perl's <b>malloc()</b>), Devel::Peek provides an access to
    this API.</p>
<p class="Pp">Use <b>mstat()</b> function to emit a memory state statistic to
    the terminal. For more information on the format of output of <b>mstat()</b>
    see &quot;Using <span class="Li">$ENV</span>{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}&quot; in
    perldebguts.</p>
<p class="Pp">Three additional functions allow access to this statistic from
    Perl. First, use <span class="Li">&quot;mstats_fillhash(%hash)&quot;</span>
    to get the information contained in the output of <b>mstat()</b> into
    <span class="Li">%hash</span>. The field of this hash are</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  minbucket nbuckets sbrk_good sbrk_slack sbrked_remains sbrks
  start_slack topbucket topbucket_ev topbucket_odd total total_chain
  total_sbrk totfree
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Two additional fields <span class="Li">&quot;free&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;used&quot;</span> contain array references which
    provide per-bucket count of free and used chunks. Two other fields
    <span class="Li">&quot;mem_size&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;available_size&quot;</span> contain array references
    which provide the information about the allocated size and usable size of
    chunks in each bucket. Again, see &quot;Using
    <span class="Li">$ENV</span>{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}&quot; in perldebguts for
    details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Keep in mind that only the first several &quot;odd-numbered&quot;
    buckets are used, so the information on size of the &quot;odd-numbered&quot;
    buckets which are not used is probably meaningless.</p>
<p class="Pp">The information in</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> mem_size available_size minbucket nbuckets
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is the property of a particular build of perl, and does not depend
    on the current process. If you do not provide the optional argument to the
    functions <b>mstats_fillhash()</b>, <b>fill_mstats()</b>,
    <b>mstats2hash()</b>, then the information in fields
    <span class="Li">&quot;mem_size&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;available_size&quot;</span> is not updated.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;fill_mstats($buf)&quot;</span> is a much
    cheaper call (both speedwise and memory-wise) which collects the statistic
    into <span class="Li">$buf</span> in machine-readable form. At a later
    moment you may need to call <span class="Li">&quot;mstats2hash($buf,
    %hash)&quot;</span> to use this information to fill
    <span class="Li">%hash</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">All three APIs
    <span class="Li">&quot;fill_mstats($buf)&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;mstats_fillhash(%hash)&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;mstats2hash($buf, %hash)&quot;</span> are designed to
    allocate no memory if used <i>the second time</i> on the same
    <span class="Li">$buf</span> and/or <span class="Li">%hash</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">So, if you want to collect memory info in a cycle, you may
  call</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $#buf = 999;
  fill_mstats($_) for @buf;
  mstats_fillhash(%report, 1);          # Static info too
  foreach (@buf) {
    # Do something...
    fill_mstats $_;                     # Collect statistic
  }
  foreach (@buf) {
    mstats2hash($_, %report);           # Preserve static info
    # Do something with %report
  }

<p class="Pp">The following examples don't attempt to show everything as that
    would be a monumental task, and, frankly, we don't want this manpage to be
    an internals document for Perl. The examples do demonstrate some basics of
    the raw Perl datatypes, and should suffice to get most determined people on
    their way. There are no guidewires or safety nets, nor blazed trails, so be
    prepared to travel alone from this point and on and, if at all possible,
    don't fall into the quicksand (it's bad for business).</p>

    the body is at 0xbc288. Its reference count is 1. It has the
    <span class="Li">&quot;POK&quot;</span> flag set, meaning its current PV
    field is valid. Because POK is set we look at the PV item to see what is in
    the scalar. The \0 at the end indicate that this PV is properly
    NUL-terminated. Note that the IV field still contains its old numeric value,
    but because FLAGS doesn't have IOK set, we must ignore the IV item. CUR
    indicates the number of characters in the PV. LEN indicates the number of
    bytes allocated for the PV (at least one more than CUR, because LEN includes
    an extra byte for the end-of-string marker, then usually rounded up to some
    efficient allocation unit).</p>

<p class="Pp">This shows that we have an SV which is a reference, which points
    at another SV. In this case that second SV is a PVMG, a blessed scalar.
    Because it is blessed it has the <span class="Li">&quot;OBJECT&quot;</span>
    flag set. Note that an SV which holds a C pointer also has the
    <span class="Li">&quot;IOK&quot;</span> flag set. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;STASH&quot;</span> is set to the package name which
    this SV was blessed into.</p>
<p class="Pp">The output from an XSUB which uses something like the T_PTRREF
    map, which doesn't bless the object, might look something like this:</p>
