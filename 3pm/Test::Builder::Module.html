<p class="Pp">This is a superclass for Test::Builder-based modules. It provides
    a handful of common functionality and a method of getting at the underlying
    Test::Builder object.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Importing"><a class="permalink" href="#Importing">Importing</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Test::Builder::Module is a subclass of Exporter which means your
    module is also a subclass of Exporter. <span class="Li">@EXPORT</span>,
    <span class="Li">@EXPORT_OK</span>, etc... all act normally.</p>
<p class="Pp">A few methods are provided to do the <span class="Li">&quot;use
    Your::Module tests =&gt; 23&quot;</span> part for you.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>import</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Test::Builder::Module provides an
    <span class="Li">&quot;import()&quot;</span> method which acts in the same
    basic way as Test::More's, setting the plan and controlling exporting of
    functions and variables. This allows your module to set the plan independent
    of Test::More.</p>
<p class="Pp">All arguments passed to
    <span class="Li">&quot;import()&quot;</span> are passed onto
    <span class="Li">&quot;Your::Module-&gt;builder-&gt;plan()&quot;</span> with
    the exception of <span class="Li">&quot;import =&gt;[qw(things to
    import)]&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Your::Module import =&gt; [qw(this that)], tests =&gt; 23;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">says to import the functions
    <span class="Li">&quot;this()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;that()&quot;</span> as well as set the plan to be 23
    tests.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;import()&quot;</span> also sets the
    <span class="Li">&quot;exported_to()&quot;</span> attribute of your builder
    to be the caller of the <span class="Li">&quot;import()&quot;</span>
    function.</p>
<p class="Pp">Additional behaviors can be added to your
    <span class="Li">&quot;import()&quot;</span> method by overriding
    <span class="Li">&quot;import_extra()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>import_extra</i></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    Your::Module-&gt;import_extra(\@import_args);
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;import_extra()&quot;</span> is called by
    <span class="Li">&quot;import()&quot;</span>. It provides an opportunity for
    you to add behaviors to your module based on its import list.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any extra arguments which shouldn't be passed on to
    <span class="Li">&quot;plan()&quot;</span> should be stripped off by this
    method.</p>
<p class="Pp">See Test::More for an example of its use.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b> This mechanism is <i>VERY ALPHA AND LIKELY TO
    CHANGE</i> as it feels like a bit of an ugly hack in its current form.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Builder"><a class="permalink" href="#Builder">Builder</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Test::Builder::Module provides some methods of getting at the
    underlying Test::Builder object.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>builder</i></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  my $builder = Your::Class-&gt;builder;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This method returns the Test::Builder object associated with
    Your::Class. It is not a constructor so you can call it as often as you
    like.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is the preferred way to get the Test::Builder object. You
    should <i>not</i> get it via
    <span class="Li">&quot;Test::Builder-&gt;new&quot;</span> as was previously
    recommended.</p>
<p class="Pp">The object returned by
    <span class="Li">&quot;builder()&quot;</span> may change at runtime so you
    should call <span class="Li">&quot;builder()&quot;</span> inside each
    function rather than store it in a global.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

      my $builder = Your::Class-&gt;builder;
