<h1 class="Sh" id="ONESIDED_LEXICONS"><a class="permalink" href="#ONESIDED_LEXICONS">ONESIDED
  LEXICONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>Adapted from a suggestion by Dan Muey</i></p>
<p class="Pp">It may be common (for example at your main lexicon) that the hash
    keys and values coincide. Like that</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    q{Hello, tell me your name} 
      =&gt; q{Hello, tell me your name}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It would be nice to just write:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    q{Hello, tell me your name} =&gt; ''
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and have this magically inflated to the first form. Among the
    advantages of such representation, that would lead to smaller files, less
    prone to mistyping or mispasting, and handy to someone translating it which
    can simply copy the main lexicon and enter the translation instead of having
    to remove the value first.</p>
<p class="Pp">That can be achieved by overriding
    <span class="Li">&quot;init&quot;</span> in your class and working on the
    main lexicon with code like that:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    package My::I18N;
    ...

    sub init {
        my $lh = shift; # a newborn handle
        $lh-&gt;SUPER::init();
        inflate_lexicon(\%My::I18N::en::Lexicon);
        return;
    }

    sub inflate_lexicon {
        my $lex = shift;
        while (my ($k, $v) = each %$lex) {
            $v = $k if !defined $v || $v eq '';
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here we are assuming
    <span class="Li">&quot;My::I18N::en&quot;</span> to own the main
  lexicon.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are some downsides here: the size economy will not stand at
    runtime after this <span class="Li">&quot;init()&quot;</span> runs. But it
    should not be that critical, since if you don't have space for that, you
    won't have space for any other language besides the main one as well. You
    could do that too with ties, expanding the value at lookup time which should
    be more time expensive as an option.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DECIMAL_PLACES_IN_NUMBER_FORMATTING"><a class="permalink" href="#DECIMAL_PLACES_IN_NUMBER_FORMATTING">DECIMAL
  PLACES IN NUMBER FORMATTING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>After CPAN RT #36136
    (https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=36136)</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The documentation of Locale::Maketext advises that the standard
    bracket method <span class="Li">&quot;numf&quot;</span> is limited and that
    you must override that for better results. It even suggests the use of
    Number::Format.</p>
<p class="Pp">One such defect of standard
    <span class="Li">&quot;numf&quot;</span> is to not be able to use a certain
    decimal precision. For example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $lh-&gt;maketext('pi is [numf,_1]', 355/113);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">outputs</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    pi is 3.14159292035398
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Since pi X 355/116 is only accurate to 6 decimal places, you would
    want to say:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $lh-&gt;maketext('pi is [numf,_1,6]', 355/113);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and get &quot;pi is 3.141592&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">One solution for that could use
    <span class="Li">&quot;Number::Format&quot;</span> like that:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    package Wuu;

    use base qw(Locale::Maketext);

    use Number::Format;

    # can be overridden according to language conventions
    sub _numf_params {
        return (
            -thousands_sep  =&gt; '.',
            -decimal_point  =&gt; ',',
            -decimal_digits =&gt; 2,
        );
    }

    # builds a Number::Format
    sub _numf_formatter {
        my ($lh, $scale) = @_;
        my @params = $lh-&gt;_numf_params;
        if ($scale) { # use explicit scale rather than default
            push @params, (-decimal_digits =&gt; $scale);
        }
        return Number::Format-&gt;new(@params);
    }

    sub numf {
        my ($lh, $n, $scale) = @_;
        # get the (cached) formatter
        my $nf = $lh-&gt;{__nf}{$scale} ||= $lh-&gt;_numf_formatter($scale);
        # format the number itself
        return $nf-&gt;format_number($n);
    }

    package Wuu::pt;

    use base qw(Wuu);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and then</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    my $lh = Wuu-&gt;get_handle('pt');
    $lh-&gt;maketext('A [numf,_1,3] km de distancia', 1550.2222);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">would return &quot;A 1.550,222 km de distancia&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Notice that the standard utility methods of
    <span class="Li">&quot;Locale::Maketext&quot;</span> are irremediably
    limited because they could not aim to do everything that could be expected
    from them in different languages, cultures and applications. So extending
    <span class="Li">&quot;numf&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;quant&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span> is natural as soon as your needs
    exceed what the standard ones do.</p>
