<p class="Pp">Since Perl 5.8, thread programming has been available using a
    model called <i>interpreter threads</i> which provides a new Perl
    interpreter for each thread, and, by default, results in no data or state
    information being shared between threads.</p>
<p class="Pp">(Prior to Perl 5.8, <i>5005threads</i> was available through the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Thread.pm&quot;</span> API. This threading model has
    been deprecated, and was removed as of Perl 5.10.0.)</p>
<p class="Pp">As just mentioned, all variables are, by default, thread local. To
    use shared variables, you need to also load threads::shared:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use threads;
    use threads::shared;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When loading threads::shared, you must <span class="Li">&quot;use
    threads&quot;</span> before you <span class="Li">&quot;use
    threads::shared&quot;</span>. (<span class="Li">&quot;threads&quot;</span>
    will emit a warning if you do it the other way around.)</p>
<p class="Pp">It is strongly recommended that you enable threads via
    <span class="Li">&quot;use threads&quot;</span> as early as possible in your
    script.</p>
<p class="Pp">If needed, scripts can be written so as to run on both threaded
    and non-threaded Perls:</p>

    <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;create()&quot;</span> with a hash reference as
    the first argument:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $thr = threads-&gt;create({'context' =&gt; 'list'}, \&amp;foo);
    ...
    my @results = $thr-&gt;join();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In the above, the threads object is returned to the parent thread
    in scalar context, and the thread's entry point function
    <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span> will be called in list (array)
    context such that the parent thread can receive a list (array) from the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;join()&quot;</span> call.
    (<span class="Li">'array'</span> is synonymous with
    <span class="Li">'list'</span>.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, if you need the threads object, but your thread will
    not be returning a value (i.e., <i>void</i> context), you would do the
    following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $thr = threads-&gt;create({'context' =&gt; 'void'}, \&amp;foo);
    ...
    $thr-&gt;join();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The context type may also be used as the <i>key</i> in the hash
    reference followed by a <i>true</i> value:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    threads-&gt;create({'scalar' =&gt; 1}, \&amp;foo);
    ...
    my ($thr) = threads-&gt;list();

  STACK SIZE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The default per-thread stack size for different platforms varies
    significantly, and is almost always far more than is needed for most
    applications. On Win32, Perl's makefile explicitly sets the default stack to
    16 MB; on most other platforms, the system default is used, which again may
    be much larger than is needed.</p>
<p class="Pp">By tuning the stack size to more accurately reflect your
    application's needs, you may significantly reduce your application's memory
    usage, and increase the number of simultaneously running threads.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that on Windows, address space allocation granularity is 64
    KB, therefore, setting the stack smaller than that on Win32 Perl will not
    save any more memory.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dt>$size = $thr-&gt;<b>get_stack_size()</b>;</dt>
  <dd>Returns the stack size for a particular thread. A return value of zero
      indicates the system default stack size was used for the thread.</dd>
  <dt>$old_size = threads-&gt;set_stack_size($new_size);</dt>
  <dd>Sets a new default per-thread stack size, and returns the previous
      setting.
    <p class="Pp">Some platforms have a minimum thread stack size. Trying to set
        the stack size below this value will result in a warning, and the
        minimum stack size will be used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Some Linux platforms have a maximum stack size. Setting too
        large of a stack size will cause thread creation to fail.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If needed, <span class="Li">$new_size</span> will be rounded
        up to the next multiple of the memory page size (usually 4096 or

<p class="Pp">When safe signals is in effect (the default behavior - see
    &quot;Unsafe signals&quot; for more details), then signals may be sent and
    acted upon by individual threads.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$thr-&gt;kill('SIG...');</dt>
  <dd>Sends the specified signal to the thread. Signal names and (positive)
      signal numbers are the same as those supported by <b>kill()</b>. For
      example, 'SIGTERM', 'TERM' and (depending on the OS) 15 are all valid
      arguments to <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;kill()&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Returns the thread object to allow for method chaining:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $thr-&gt;kill('SIG...')-&gt;join();
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Signal handlers need to be set up in the threads for the signals
    they are expected to act upon. Here's an example for <i>cancelling</i> a
    thread:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use threads;
    sub thr_func
    {
        # Thread 'cancellation' signal handler
        $SIG{'KILL'} = sub { threads-&gt;exit(); };
        ...
    }
    # Create a thread
    my $thr = threads-&gt;create('thr_func');
    ...
    # Signal the thread to terminate, and then detach
    # it so that it will get cleaned up automatically
    $thr-&gt;kill('KILL')-&gt;detach();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here's another simplistic example that illustrates the use of
    thread signalling in conjunction with a semaphore to provide rudimentary
    <i>suspend</i> and <i>resume</i> capabilities:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use threads;
    use Thread::Semaphore;
    sub thr_func
    {
        my $sema = shift;
        # Thread 'suspend/resume' signal handler
        $SIG{'STOP'} = sub {
            $sema-&gt;down();      # Thread suspended
            $sema-&gt;up();        # Thread resumes
        };
        ...
    }
    # Create a semaphore and pass it to a thread
    my $sema = Thread::Semaphore-&gt;new();
    my $thr = threads-&gt;create('thr_func', $sema);
    # Suspend the thread
    $sema-&gt;down();
    $thr-&gt;kill('STOP');
    ...
    # Allow the thread to continue
    $sema-&gt;up();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">CAVEAT: The thread signalling capability provided by this module
    does not actually send signals via the OS. It <i>emulates</i> signals at the
    Perl-level such that signal handlers are called in the appropriate thread.
    For example, sending
    <span class="Li">&quot;$thr-&gt;kill('STOP')&quot;</span> does not actually
    suspend a thread (or the whole process), but does cause a
    <span class="Li">$SIG{'STOP'}</span> handler to be called in that thread (as
    illustrated above).</p>
<p class="Pp">As such, signals that would normally not be appropriate to use in
    the <span class="Li">&quot;kill()&quot;</span> command (e.g.,
    <span class="Li">&quot;kill('KILL', $$)&quot;</span>) are okay to use with
    the <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;kill()&quot;</span> method (again, as
    illustrated above).</p>
<p class="Pp">Correspondingly, sending a signal to a thread does not disrupt the
    operation the thread is currently working on: The signal will be acted upon
    after the current operation has completed. For instance, if the thread is
    <i>stuck</i> on an I/O call, sending it a signal will not cause the I/O call
    to be interrupted such that the signal is acted up immediately.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sending a signal to a terminated/finished thread is ignored.</p>

    returned from threads</a></dt>
  <dd>When a value is returned from a thread through a
      <span class="Li">&quot;join&quot;</span> operation, the value and
      everything that it references is copied across to the joining thread, in
      much the same way that values are copied upon thread creation. This works
      fine for most kinds of value, including arrays, hashes, and subroutines.
      The copying recurses through array elements, reference scalars, variables
      closed over by subroutines, and other kinds of reference.
    <p class="Pp">However, everything referenced by the returned value is a
        fresh copy in the joining thread, even if a returned object had in the
        child thread been a copy of something that previously existed in the
        parent thread. After joining, the parent will therefore have a duplicate
        of each such object. This sometimes matters, especially if the object
        gets mutated; this can especially matter for private data to which a
        returned subroutine provides access.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Returning"><a class="permalink" href="#Returning">Returning blessed
    objects from threads</a></dt>
  <dd>Returning blessed objects from threads does not work. Depending on the
      classes involved, you may be able to work around this by returning a
      serialized version of the object (e.g., using Data::Dumper or Storable),
      and then reconstituting it in the joining thread. If you're using Perl
      5.10.0 or later, and if the class supports shared objects, you can pass
      them via shared queues.</dd>
  <dt id="END"><a class="permalink" href="#END">END blocks in threads</a></dt>
  <dd>It is possible to add END blocks to threads by using require or eval with
      the appropriate code. These <span class="Li">&quot;END&quot;</span> blocks
      will then be executed when the thread's interpreter is destroyed (i.e.,
      either during a <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;join()&quot;</span> call, or
      at program termination).
    <p class="Pp">However, calling any threads methods in such an
        <span class="Li">&quot;END&quot;</span> block will most likely
        <i>fail</i> (e.g., the application may hang, or generate an error) due
        to mutexes that are needed to control functionality within the threads
        module.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For this reason, the use of
        <span class="Li">&quot;END&quot;</span> blocks in threads is
        <b>strongly</b> discouraged.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Open"><a class="permalink" href="#Open">Open directory
    handles</a></dt>
  <dd>In perl 5.14 and higher, on systems other than Windows that do not support
      the <span class="Li">&quot;fchdir&quot;</span> C function, directory
      handles (see opendir) will not be copied to new threads. You can use the
      <span class="Li">&quot;d_fchdir&quot;</span> variable in Config.pm to
      determine whether your system supports it.
    <p class="Pp">In prior perl versions, spawning threads with open directory
        handles would crash the interpreter. [perl #75154]
        &lt;https://rt.perl.org/rt3/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=75154&gt;</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Detached"><a class="permalink" href="#Detached">Detached threads and
    global destruction</a></dt>
  <dd>If the main thread exits while there are detached threads which are still
      running, then Perl's global destruction phase is not executed because
      otherwise certain global structures that control the operation of threads
      and that are allocated in the main thread's memory may get destroyed
      before the detached thread is destroyed.
    <p class="Pp">If you are using any code that requires the execution of the
        global destruction phase for clean up (e.g., removing temp files), then
        do not use detached threads, but rather join all threads before exiting
        the program.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Perl~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Perl~2">Perl Bugs and the CPAN
    Version of threads</a></dt>
  <dd>Support for threads extends beyond the code in this module (i.e.,
      <i>threads.pm</i> and <i>threads.xs</i>), and into the Perl interpreter
      itself. Older versions of Perl contain bugs that may manifest themselves
      despite using the latest version of threads from CPAN. There is no
      workaround for this other than upgrading to the latest version of Perl.
    <p class="Pp">Even with the latest version of Perl, it is known that certain
        constructs with threads may result in warning messages concerning leaked
        scalars or unreferenced scalars. However, such warnings are harmless,
        and may safely be ignored.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can search for threads related bug reports at
        &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Public/&gt;. If needed submit any new bugs,
        problems, patches, etc. to:
