<p class="Pp">File::Which finds the full or relative paths to executable
    programs on the system. This is normally the function of
    <span class="Li">&quot;which&quot;</span> utility.
    <span class="Li">&quot;which&quot;</span> is typically implemented as either
    a program or a built in shell command. On some platforms, such as Microsoft
    Windows it is not provided as part of the core operating system. This module
    provides a consistent API to this functionality regardless of the underlying
    platform.</p>
<p class="Pp">The focus of this module is correctness and portability. As a
    consequence platforms where the current directory is implicitly part of the
    search path such as Microsoft Windows will find executables in the current
    directory, whereas on platforms such as UNIX where this is not the case
    executables in the current directory will only be found if the current
    directory is explicitly added to the path.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you need a portable <span class="Li">&quot;which&quot;</span>
    on the command line in an environment that does not provide it, install
    App::pwhich which provides a command line interface to this API.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Implementations"><a class="permalink" href="#Implementations">Implementations</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">File::Which searches the directories of the user's
    <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span> (the current implementation uses
    File::Spec#path to determine the correct
    <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span>), looking for executable files
    having the name specified as a parameter to &quot;which&quot;. Under Win32
    systems, which do not have a notion of directly executable files, but uses
    special extensions such as <span class="Li">&quot;.exe&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;.bat&quot;</span> to identify them,
    <span class="Li">&quot;File::Which&quot;</span> takes extra steps to assure
    that you will find the correct file (so for example, you might be searching
    for <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span>, it'll try <i>perl.exe</i>,
    <i>perl.bat</i>, etc.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Linux, *BSD and other UNIXes</i></p>
<p class="Pp">There should not be any surprises here. The current directory will
    not be searched unless it is explicitly added to the path.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Modern Windows (including NT, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10 etc)</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Windows NT has a special environment variable called
    <span class="Li">&quot;PATHEXT&quot;</span>, which is used by the shell to
    look for executable files. Usually, it will contain a list in the form
    <span class="Li">&quot;.EXE;.BAT;.COM;.JS;.VBS&quot;</span> etc. If
    <span class="Li">&quot;File::Which&quot;</span> finds such an environment
    variable, it parses the list and uses it as the different extensions.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Cygwin</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Cygwin provides a Unix-like environment for Microsoft Windows
    users. In most ways it works like other Unix and Unix-like environments, but
    in a few key aspects it works like Windows. As with other Unix environments,
    the current directory is not included in the search unless it is explicitly
    included in the search path. Like on Windows, files with
    <span class="Li">&quot;.EXE&quot;</span> or &lt;.BAT&gt; extensions will be
    discovered even if they are not part of the query.
    <span class="Li">&quot;.COM&quot;</span> or extensions specified using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;PATHEXT&quot;</span> environment variable will NOT be
    discovered without the fully qualified name, however.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Windows ME, 98, 95, MS-DOS, OS/2</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This set of operating systems don't have the
    <span class="Li">&quot;PATHEXT&quot;</span> variable, and usually you will
    find executable files there with the extensions
    <span class="Li">&quot;.exe&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;.bat&quot;</span> and (less likely)
    <span class="Li">&quot;.com&quot;</span>.
    <span class="Li">&quot;File::Which&quot;</span> uses this hardcoded list if
    it's running under Win32 but does not find a
    <span class="Li">&quot;PATHEXT&quot;</span> variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of 2015 none of these platforms are tested frequently (or
    perhaps ever), but the current maintainer is determined not to intentionally
    remove support for older operating systems.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>VMS</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Same case as Windows 9x: uses
    <span class="Li">&quot;.exe&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;.com&quot;</span> (in that order).</p>
<p class="Pp">As of 2015 the current maintainer does not test on VMS, and is in
    fact not certain it has ever been tested on VMS. If this platform is
    important to you and you can help me verify and or support it on that
    platform please contact me.</p>

<p class="Pp">True if the current directory is included in the search implicitly
    on whatever platform you are using. Normally the default is reasonable, but
    on Windows the current directory is included implicitly for older shells
    like <span class="Li">&quot;cmd.exe&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;command.com&quot;</span>, but not for newer shells
    like PowerShell. If you overrule this default, you should ALWAYS localize
    the variable to the tightest scope possible, since setting this variable
    from a module can affect other modules. Thus on Windows you can get the
    correct result if the user is running either
    <span class="Li">&quot;cmd.exe&quot;</span> or PowerShell on Windows you can
    do this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> use File::Which qw( which );
 use Shell::Guess;
 my $path = do {
   my $is_power = Shell::Guess-&gt;running_shell-&gt;is_power;
   local $File::Which::IMPLICIT_CURRENT_DIR = !$is_power;
   which 'foo';
 };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For a variety of reasons it is difficult to accurately compute the
    shell that a user is using, but Shell::Guess makes a reasonable effort.</p>

<p class="Pp">This module has no non-core requirements for Perl 5.6.2 and
    better.</p>
<p class="Pp">This module is fully supported back to Perl 5.8.1. It may work on
    5.8.0. It should work on Perl 5.6.x and I may even test on 5.6.2. I will
    accept patches to maintain compatibility for such older Perls, but you may
    need to fix it on 5.6.x / 5.8.0 and send me a patch.</p>
<p class="Pp">Not tested on VMS although there is platform specific code for
    those. Anyone who haves a second would be very kind to send me a report of
    how it went.</p>

  <dd>This module provides (among other things) a
      <span class="Li">&quot;can_run&quot;</span> function, which is similar to
      <span class="Li">&quot;which&quot;</span>. It is a much heavier module
      since it does a lot more, and if you use
      <span class="Li">&quot;can_run&quot;</span> it pulls in
      ExtUtils::MakeMaker. This combination may be overkill for applications
      which do not need IPC::Cmd's complicated interface for running programs,
      or do not need the memory overhead required for installing Perl modules.
    <p class="Pp">At least some older versions will find executables in the
        current directory, even if the current directory is not in the search
        path (which is the default on modern Unix).</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;can_run&quot;</span> converts directory
        path name to the 8.3 version on Windows using
        <span class="Li">&quot;Win32::GetShortPathName&quot;</span> in some
        cases. This is frequently useful for tools that just need to run
        something using <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> in scalar
        mode, but may be inconvenient for tools like App::pwhich where user
        readability is a premium. Relying on
        <span class="Li">&quot;Win32::GetShortPathName&quot;</span> to produce
        filenames without spaces is problematic, as 8.3 filenames can be turned
        off with tweaks to the registry (see
        &lt;https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc959352.aspx&gt;).</p>
