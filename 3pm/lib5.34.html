<p class="Pp">This is a small simple module which simplifies the manipulation of
    <span class="Li">@INC</span> at compile time.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is typically used to add extra directories to perl's search
    path so that later <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> statements will find modules
    which are not located on perl's default search path.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Adding_directories_to_@INC"><a class="permalink" href="#Adding_directories_to_@INC">Adding
  directories to @INC</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The parameters to <span class="Li">&quot;use lib&quot;</span> are
    added to the start of the perl search path. Saying</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use lib LIST;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is <i>almost</i> the same as saying</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    BEGIN { unshift(@INC, LIST) }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For each directory in LIST (called <span class="Li">$dir</span>
    here) the lib module also checks to see if a directory called
    <span class="Li">$dir</span>/$archname/auto exists. If so the
    <span class="Li">$dir</span>/$archname directory is assumed to be a
    corresponding architecture specific directory and is added to
    <span class="Li">@INC</span> in front of <span class="Li">$dir</span>.
    lib.pm also checks if directories called
    <span class="Li">$dir</span>/$version and
    <span class="Li">$dir</span>/$version/$archname exist and adds these
    directories to <span class="Li">@INC</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The current value of <span class="Li">$archname</span> can be
    found with this command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl -V:archname
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The corresponding command to get the current value of
    <span class="Li">$version</span> is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl -V:version
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To avoid memory leaks, all trailing duplicate entries in
    <span class="Li">@INC</span> are removed.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Deleting_directories_from_@INC"><a class="permalink" href="#Deleting_directories_from_@INC">Deleting
  directories from @INC</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You should normally only add directories to
    <span class="Li">@INC</span>. If you need to delete directories from
    <span class="Li">@INC</span> take care to only delete those which you added
    yourself or which you are certain are not needed by other modules in your
    script. Other modules may have added directories which they need for correct
    operation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;no lib&quot;</span> statement deletes
    all instances of each named directory from <span class="Li">@INC</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For each directory in LIST (called <span class="Li">$dir</span>
    here) the lib module also checks to see if a directory called
    <span class="Li">$dir</span>/$archname/auto exists. If so the
    <span class="Li">$dir</span>/$archname directory is assumed to be a
    corresponding architecture specific directory and is also deleted from
    <span class="Li">@INC</span>. lib.pm also checks if directories called
    <span class="Li">$dir</span>/$version and
    <span class="Li">$dir</span>/$version/$archname exist and deletes these
    directories from <span class="Li">@INC</span>.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Restoring_original_@INC"><a class="permalink" href="#Restoring_original_@INC">Restoring
  original @INC</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When the lib module is first loaded it records the current value
    of <span class="Li">@INC</span> in an array
    <span class="Li">@lib::ORIG_INC</span>. To restore
    <span class="Li">@INC</span> to that value you can say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    @INC = @lib::ORIG_INC;
</pre>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="permalink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In order to keep lib.pm small and simple, it only works with Unix
    filepaths. This doesn't mean it only works on Unix, but non-Unix users must
    first translate their file paths to Unix conventions.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    # VMS users wanting to put [.stuff.moo] into 
    # their @INC would write
    use lib 'stuff/moo';
</pre>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In the future, this module will likely use File::Spec for
    determining paths, as it does now for Mac OS (where Unix-style or Mac-style
    paths work, and Unix-style paths are converted properly to Mac-style paths
    before being added to <span class="Li">@INC</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you try to add a file to <span class="Li">@INC</span> as
    follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use lib 'this_is_a_file.txt';
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;lib&quot;</span> will warn about this. The
    sole exceptions are files with the <span class="Li">&quot;.par&quot;</span>
    extension which are intended to be used as libraries.</p>
