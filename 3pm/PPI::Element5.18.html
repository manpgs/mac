<p class="Pp">The abstract <span class="Li">&quot;PPI::Element&quot;</span>
    serves as a base class for all source-related objects, from a single
    whitespace token to an entire document. It provides a basic set of methods
    to provide a common interface and basic implementations.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="significant"><a class="permalink" href="#significant">significant</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Because we treat whitespace and other non-code items as Tokens (in
    order to be able to &quot;round trip&quot; the PPI::Document back to a file)
    the <span class="Li">&quot;significant&quot;</span> method allows us to
    distinguish between tokens that form a part of the code, and tokens that
    aren't significant, such as whitespace, POD, or the portion of a file after
    (and including) the <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span> token.</p>
<p class="Pp">Returns true if the Element is significant, or false it not.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="class"><a class="permalink" href="#class">class</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;class&quot;</span> method is provided
    as a convenience, and really does nothing more than returning
    <span class="Li">&quot;ref($self)&quot;</span>. However, some people have
    found that they appreciate the laziness of
    <span class="Li">&quot;$Foo-&gt;class eq 'whatever'&quot;</span>, so I have
    caved to popular demand and included it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the class of the Element as a string</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="tokens"><a class="permalink" href="#tokens">tokens</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;tokens&quot;</span> method returns a
    list of PPI::Token objects for the Element, essentially getting back that
    part of the document as if it had not been lexed.</p>
<p class="Pp">This also means there are no Statements and no Structures in the
    list, just the Token classes.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="content"><a class="permalink" href="#content">content</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">For <b>any</b> <span class="Li">&quot;PPI::Element&quot;</span>,
    the <span class="Li">&quot;content&quot;</span> method will reconstitute the
    base code for it as a single string. This method is also the method used for
    overloading stringification. When an Element is used in a double-quoted
    string for example, this is the method that is called.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>WARNING:</b></p>
<p class="Pp">You should be aware that because of the way that here-docs are
    handled, any here-doc content is not included in
    <span class="Li">&quot;content&quot;</span>, and as such you should
    <b>not</b> eval or execute the result if it contains any
    PPI::Token::HereDoc.</p>
<p class="Pp">The PPI::Document method
    <span class="Li">&quot;serialize&quot;</span> should be used to stringify a
    PDOM document into something that can be executed as expected.</p>

<p class="Pp">As per the Clone module, the

    without remembering to index the document, but it would be handy for things
