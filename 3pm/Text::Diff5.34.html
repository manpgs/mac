<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;diff()&quot;</span> provides a basic set of
    services akin to the GNU <span class="Li">&quot;diff&quot;</span> utility.
    It is not anywhere near as feature complete as GNU
    <span class="Li">&quot;diff&quot;</span>, but it is better integrated with
    Perl and available on all platforms. It is often faster than shelling out to
    a system's <span class="Li">&quot;diff&quot;</span> executable for small
    files, and generally slower on larger files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Relies on Algorithm::Diff for, well, the algorithm. This may not
    produce the same exact diff as a system's local
    <span class="Li">&quot;diff&quot;</span> executable, but it will be a valid
    diff and comprehensible by <span class="Li">&quot;patch&quot;</span>. We
    haven't seen any differences between Algorithm::Diff's logic and GNU
    <span class="Li">&quot;diff&quot;</span>'s, but we have not examined them to
    make sure they are indeed identical.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note</b>: If you don't want to import the
    <span class="Li">&quot;diff&quot;</span> function, do one of the
  following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>   use Text::Diff ();
   require Text::Diff;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That's a pretty rare occurrence, so
    <span class="Li">&quot;diff()&quot;</span> is exported by default.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you pass a filename, but the file can't be read, then
    <span class="Li">&quot;diff()&quot;</span> will
    <span class="Li">&quot;croak&quot;</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;diff()&quot;</span> takes two parameters
    from which to draw input and a set of options to control its output. The
    options are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="FILENAME_A,"><a class="permalink" href="#FILENAME_A,">FILENAME_A,
    MTIME_A, FILENAME_B, MTIME_B</a></dt>
  <dd>The name of the file and the modification time &quot;files&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">These are filled in automatically for each file when
        <span class="Li">&quot;diff()&quot;</span> is passed a filename, unless
        a defined value is passed in.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a filename is not passed in and FILENAME_A and FILENAME_B
        are not provided or are <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>, the
        header will not be printed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unused on <span class="Li">&quot;OldStyle&quot;</span>
      diffs.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="OFFSET_A,"><a class="permalink" href="#OFFSET_A,">OFFSET_A,
    OFFSET_B</a></dt>
  <dd>The index of the first line / element. These default to 1 for all
      parameter types except ARRAY references, for which the default is 0. This
      is because ARRAY references are presumed to be data structures, while the
      others are line-oriented text.</dd>
  <dt id="STYLE"><a class="permalink" href="#STYLE">STYLE</a></dt>
  <dd>&quot;Unified&quot;, &quot;Context&quot;, &quot;OldStyle&quot;, or an
      object or class reference for a class providing
      <span class="Li">&quot;file_header()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;hunk_header()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;hunk()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;hunk_footer()&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;file_footer()&quot;</span> methods. The two
      <b>footer()</b> methods are provided for overloading only; none of the
      formats provide them.
    <p class="Pp">Defaults to &quot;Unified&quot; (unlike standard
        <span class="Li">&quot;diff&quot;</span>, but Unified is what's most
        often used in submitting patches and is the most human readable of the
        three.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the package indicated by the STYLE has no
        <span class="Li">&quot;hunk()&quot;</span> method,
        <span class="Li">&quot;diff()&quot;</span> will load it automatically
        (lazy loading). Since all such packages should inherit from
        <span class="Li">&quot;Text::Diff::Base&quot;</span>, this should be
        marvy.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Styles may be specified as class names
        (<span class="Li">&quot;STYLE =&gt; 'Foo'&quot;</span>), in which case
        they will be <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span>ed with no
        parameters, or as objects (<span class="Li">&quot;STYLE =&gt;
        Foo-&gt;new&quot;</span>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="CONTEXT"><a class="permalink" href="#CONTEXT">CONTEXT</a></dt>
  <dd>How many lines before and after each diff to display. Ignored on old-style
      diffs. Defaults to 3.</dd>
  <dt id="OUTPUT"><a class="permalink" href="#OUTPUT">OUTPUT</a></dt>
  <dd>Examples and their equivalent subroutines:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    OUTPUT   =&gt; \*FOOHANDLE,   # like: sub { print FOOHANDLE shift() }
    OUTPUT   =&gt; \$output,      # like: sub { $output .= shift }
    OUTPUT   =&gt; \@output,      # like: sub { push @output, shift }
    OUTPUT   =&gt; sub { $output .= shift },
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If no <span class="Li">&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</span> is supplied,
        returns the diffs in a string. If
        <span class="Li">&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</span> is a
        <span class="Li">&quot;CODE&quot;</span> ref, it will be called once
        with the (optional) file header, and once for each hunk body with the
        text to emit. If <span class="Li">&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</span> is an
        IO::Handle, output will be emitted to that handle.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="FILENAME_PREFIX_A,"><a class="permalink" href="#FILENAME_PREFIX_A,">FILENAME_PREFIX_A,
    FILENAME_PREFIX_B</a></dt>
  <dd>The string to print before the filename in the header. Unused on
      <span class="Li">&quot;OldStyle&quot;</span> diffs. Defaults are
      <span class="Li">&quot;---&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;+++&quot;</span> for Unified and
      <span class="Li">&quot;***&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;+++&quot;</span> for Context.</dd>
  <dt id="KEYGEN,"><a class="permalink" href="#KEYGEN,">KEYGEN,
    KEYGEN_ARGS</a></dt>
  <dd>These are passed to &quot;traverse_sequences&quot; in
    Algorithm::Diff.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note</b>: if neither
    <span class="Li">&quot;FILENAME_&quot;</span> option is defined, the header
    will not be printed. If at least one is present, the other and both
    <span class="Li">&quot;MTIME_&quot;</span> options must be present or
    &quot;Use of undefined variable&quot; warnings will be generated (except on
    <span class="Li">&quot;OldStyle&quot;</span> diffs, which ignores these
    options).</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Formatting_Classes"><a class="permalink" href="#Formatting_Classes">Formatting
  Classes</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">These functions implement the output formats. They are grouped in
    to classes so <span class="Li">&quot;diff()&quot;</span> can use class names
    to call the correct set of output routines and so that you may inherit from
    them easily. There are no constructors or instance methods for these
    classes, though subclasses may provide them if need be.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each class has <span class="Li">&quot;file_header()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;hunk_header()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;hunk()&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;footer()&quot;</span> methods identical to those
    documented in the <span class="Li">&quot;Text::Diff::Unified&quot;</span>
    section. <span class="Li">&quot;header()&quot;</span> is called before the
    <span class="Li">&quot;hunk()&quot;</span> is first called,
    <span class="Li">&quot;footer()&quot;</span> afterwards. The default footer
    function is an empty method provided for overloading:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    sub footer { return &quot;End of patch\n&quot; }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Some output formats are provided by external modules (which are
    loaded automatically), such as Text::Diff::Table. These are are documented
    here to keep the documentation simple.</p>
