<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;use utf8&quot;</span> pragma tells the
    Perl parser to allow UTF-8 in the program text in the current lexical scope
    (allow UTF-EBCDIC on EBCDIC based platforms). The <span class="Li">&quot;no
    utf8&quot;</span> pragma tells Perl to switch back to treating the source
    text as literal bytes in the current lexical scope.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Do not use this pragma for anything else than telling Perl that
    your</b> <b>script is written in UTF-8.</b> The utility functions described
    below are directly usable without <span class="Li">&quot;use
    utf8;&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because it is not possible to reliably tell UTF-8 from native 8
    bit encodings, you need either a Byte Order Mark at the beginning of your
    source code, or <span class="Li">&quot;use utf8;&quot;</span>, to instruct
    perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">When UTF-8 becomes the standard source format, this pragma will
    effectively become a no-op. For convenience in what follows the term
    <i>UTF-X</i> is used to refer to UTF-8 on ASCII and ISO Latin based
    platforms and UTF-EBCDIC on EBCDIC based platforms.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also the effects of the <span class="Li">&quot;-C&quot;</span>
    switch and its cousin, the <span class="Li">$ENV{PERL_UNICODE}</span>, in
    perlrun.</p>
<p class="Pp">Enabling the <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span> pragma has
    the following effect:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>Bytes in the source text that have their high-bit set will be treated as
      being part of a literal UTF-X sequence. This includes most literals such
      as identifier names, string constants, and constant regular expression
      patterns.
    <p class="Pp">On EBCDIC platforms characters in the Latin 1 character set
        are treated as being part of a literal UTF-EBCDIC character.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Note that if you have bytes with the eighth bit on in your script
    (for example embedded Latin-1 in your string literals),
    <span class="Li">&quot;use utf8&quot;</span> will be unhappy since the bytes
    are most probably not well-formed UTF-X. If you want to have such bytes
    under <span class="Li">&quot;use utf8&quot;</span>, you can disable this
    pragma until the end the block (or file, if at top level) by
    <span class="Li">&quot;no utf8;&quot;</span>.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Utility_functions"><a class="permalink" href="#Utility_functions">Utility
  functions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The following functions are defined in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;utf8::&quot;</span> package by the Perl core. You do
    not need to say <span class="Li">&quot;use utf8&quot;</span> to use these
    and in fact you should not say that unless you really want to have UTF-8
    source code.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">$num_octets</span> = utf8::upgrade($string)
    <p class="Pp">Converts in-place the internal representation of the string
        from an octet sequence in the native encoding (Latin-1 or EBCDIC) to
        <i>UTF-X</i>. The logical character sequence itself is unchanged. If
        <i></i><i>$string</i><i></i> is already stored as <i>UTF-X</i>, then
        this is a no-op. Returns the number of octets necessary to represent the
        string as <i>UTF-X</i>. Can be used to make sure that the UTF-8 flag is
        on, so that <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;lc()&quot;</span> work as Unicode on strings
        containing characters in the range 0x80-0xFF (on ASCII and
      derivatives).</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note that this function does not handle arbitrary
        encodings.</b> Therefore Encode is recommended for the general purposes;
        see also Encode.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">$success</span> = utf8::downgrade($string[, FAIL_OK])
    <p class="Pp">Converts in-place the internal representation of the string
        from <i>UTF-X</i> to the equivalent octet sequence in the native
        encoding (Latin-1 or EBCDIC). The logical character sequence itself is
        unchanged. If <i></i><i>$string</i><i></i> is already stored as native 8
        bit, then this is a no-op. Can be used to make sure that the UTF-8 flag
        is off, e.g. when you want to make sure that the <i>substr()</i> or
        <i>length()</i> function works with the usually faster byte
      algorithm.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Fails if the original <i>UTF-X</i> sequence cannot be
        represented in the native 8 bit encoding. On failure dies or, if the
        value of <span class="Li">&quot;FAIL_OK&quot;</span> is true, returns
        false.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Returns true on success.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note that this function does not handle arbitrary

        see also Encode.</p>
  </li>
  <li>utf8::encode($string)
    <p class="Pp">Converts in-place the character sequence to the corresponding
        octet sequence in <i>UTF-X</i>. That is, every (possibly wide) character
        gets replaced with a sequence of one or more characters that represent
        the individual <i>UTF-X</i> bytes of the character. The UTF8 flag is
        turned off. Returns nothing.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    my $a = &quot;\x{100}&quot;; # $a contains one character, with ord 0x100

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note that this function does not handle arbitrary

        see also Encode.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">$success</span> = utf8::decode($string)
    <p class="Pp">Attempts to convert in-place the octet sequence in
        <i>UTF-X</i> to the corresponding character sequence. That is, it
        replaces each sequence of characters in the string whose ords represent
        a valid UTF-X byte sequence, with the corresponding single character.
        The UTF-8 flag is turned on only if the source string contains
        multiple-byte <i>UTF-X</i> characters. If <i></i><i>$string</i><i></i>
        is invalid as <i>UTF-X</i>, returns false; otherwise returns true.</p>

  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">$flag</span> = utf8::is_utf8(STRING)
    <p class="Pp">(Since Perl 5.8.1) Test whether STRING is encoded internally
        in UTF-8. Functionally the same as <i>Encode::is_utf8()</i>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">$flag</span> = utf8::valid(STRING)
    <p class="Pp">[INTERNAL] Test whether STRING is in a consistent state
        regarding UTF-8. Will return true if it is well-formed UTF-8 and has the
        UTF-8 flag on <b>or</b> if STRING is held as bytes (both these states
        are 'consistent'). Main reason for this routine is to allow Perl's
        testsuite to check that operations have left strings in a consistent
        state. You most probably want to use <i>utf8::is_utf8()</i> instead.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;utf8::encode&quot;</span> is like
    <span class="Li">&quot;utf8::upgrade&quot;</span>, but the UTF8 flag is
    cleared. See perlunicode for more on the UTF8 flag and the C API functions
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_utf8_upgrade&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_utf8_downgrade&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_utf8_encode&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_utf8_decode&quot;</span>, which are wrapped by the
    Perl functions <span class="Li">&quot;utf8::upgrade&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;utf8::downgrade&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;utf8::encode&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;utf8::decode&quot;</span>. Also, the functions
    utf8::is_utf8, utf8::valid, utf8::encode, utf8::decode, utf8::upgrade, and
    utf8::downgrade are actually internal, and thus always available, without a
    <span class="Li">&quot;require utf8&quot;</span> statement.</p>

<p class="Pp">One can have Unicode in identifier names, but not in package/class
    or subroutine names. While some limited functionality towards this does
    exist as of Perl 5.8.0, that is more accidental than designed; use of
    Unicode for the said purposes is unsupported.</p>
<p class="Pp">One reason of this unfinishedness is its (currently) inherent
    unportability: since both package names and subroutine names may need to be
    mapped to file and directory names, the Unicode capability of the filesystem
    becomes important-- and there unfortunately aren't portable answers.</p>
