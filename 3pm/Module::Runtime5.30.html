<p class="Pp">The functions exported by this module deal with runtime handling
    of Perl modules, which are normally handled at compile time. This module
    avoids using any other modules, so that it can be used in low-level
    infrastructure.</p>
<p class="Pp">The parts of this module that work with module names apply the
    same syntax that is used for barewords in Perl source. In principle this
    syntax can vary between versions of Perl, and this module applies the syntax
    of the Perl on which it is running. In practice the usable syntax hasn't
    changed yet. There's some intent for Unicode module names to be supported in
    the future, but this hasn't yet amounted to any consistent facility.</p>
<p class="Pp">The functions of this module whose purpose is to load modules
    include workarounds for three old Perl core bugs regarding
    <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>. These workarounds are applied
    on any Perl version where the bugs exist, except for a case where one of the
    bugs cannot be adequately worked around in pure Perl.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Module_name_syntax"><a class="permalink" href="#Module_name_syntax">Module
  name syntax</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The usable module name syntax has not changed from Perl 5.000 up
    to Perl 5.19.8. The syntax is composed entirely of ASCII characters. From
    Perl 5.6 onwards there has been some attempt to allow the use of non-ASCII
    Unicode characters in Perl source, but it was fundamentally broken (like the
    entirety of Perl 5.6's Unicode handling) and remained pretty much entirely
    unusable until it got some attention in the Perl 5.15 series. Although
    Unicode is now consistently accepted by the parser in some places, it
    remains broken for module names. Furthermore, there has not yet been any
    work on how to map Unicode module names into filenames, so in that respect
    also Unicode module names are unusable.</p>
<p class="Pp">The module name syntax is, precisely: the string must consist of
    one or more segments separated by <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span>;
    each segment must consist of one or more identifier characters (ASCII
    alphanumerics plus &quot;_&quot;); the first character of the string must
    not be a digit. Thus
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;IO::File&quot;</span>&quot;,
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span>&quot;, and
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;foo::123::x_0&quot;</span>&quot; are all valid
    module names, whereas &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;IO::&quot;</span>&quot;
    and &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;1foo::bar&quot;</span>&quot; are not.
    <span class="Li">&quot;'&quot;</span> separators are not permitted by this
    module, though they remain usable in Perl source, being translated to
    <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span> in the parser.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Core_bugs_worked_around"><a class="permalink" href="#Core_bugs_worked_around">Core
  bugs worked around</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The first bug worked around is core bug [perl #68590], which
    causes lexical state in one file to leak into another that is
    <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>d/<span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>d
    from it. This bug is present from Perl 5.6 up to Perl 5.10, and is fixed in
    Perl 5.11.0. From Perl 5.9.4 up to Perl 5.10.0 no satisfactory workaround is
    possible in pure Perl. The workaround means that modules loaded via this
    module don't suffer this pollution of their lexical state. Modules loaded in
    other ways, or via this module on the Perl versions where the pure Perl
    workaround is impossible, remain vulnerable. The module
    Lexical::SealRequireHints provides a complete workaround for this bug.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second bug worked around causes some kinds of failure in
    module loading, principally compilation errors in the loaded module, to be
    recorded in <span class="Li">%INC</span> as if they were successful, so
    later attempts to load the same module immediately indicate success. This
    bug is present up to Perl 5.8.9, and is fixed in Perl 5.9.0. The workaround
    means that a compilation error in a module loaded via this module won't be
    cached as a success. Modules loaded in other ways remain liable to produce
    bogus <span class="Li">%INC</span> entries, and if a bogus entry exists then
    it will mislead this module if it is used to re-attempt loading.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third bug worked around causes the wrong context to be seen at
    file scope of a loaded module, if
    <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> is invoked in a location that
    inherits context from a higher scope. This bug is present up to Perl 5.11.2,
    and is fixed in Perl 5.11.3. The workaround means that a module loaded via
    this module will always see the correct context. Modules loaded in other
    ways remain vulnerable.</p>

  <dt id="module_notional_filename("><a class="permalink" href="#module_notional_filename(">module_notional_filename(NAME)</a></dt>
  <dd>Generates a notional relative filename for a module, which is used in some
      Perl core interfaces. The <i>NAME</i> is a string, which should be a valid
      module name (one or more <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span>-separated
      segments). If it is not a valid name, the function
      <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>s.
    <p class="Pp">The notional filename for the named module is generated and
        returned. This filename is always in Unix style, with
        <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> directory separators and a
        <span class="Li">&quot;.pm&quot;</span> suffix. This kind of filename
        can be used as an argument to
        <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>, and is the key that appears
        in <span class="Li">%INC</span> to identify a module, regardless of
        actual local filename syntax.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="require_module("><a class="permalink" href="#require_module(">require_module(NAME)</a></dt>
  <dd>This is essentially the bareword form of

      <i>NAME</i> is a string, which should be a valid module name (one or more
      <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span>-separated segments). If it is not a
      valid name, the function <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>s.
    <p class="Pp">The module specified by <i>NAME</i> is loaded, if it hasn't
        been already, in the manner of the bareword form of
        <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>. That means that a search
        through <span class="Li">@INC</span> is performed, and a byte-compiled
        form of the module will be used if available.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The return value is as for
        <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>. That is, it is the value

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="use_module(NAME_,"><a class="permalink" href="#use_module(NAME_,">use_module(NAME[,

  <dd>This is essentially <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> in runtime
      form, but without the importing feature (which is fundamentally a
      compile-time thing). The <i>NAME</i> is handled just like in
      <span class="Li">&quot;require_module&quot;</span> above: it must be a
      module name, and the named module is loaded as if by the bareword form of
      <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">If a <i>VERSION</i> is specified, the
        <span class="Li">&quot;VERSION&quot;</span> method of the loaded module
        is called with the specified <i>VERSION</i> as an argument. This
        normally serves to ensure that the version loaded is at least the
        version required. This is the same functionality provided by the
        <i>VERSION</i> parameter of <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On success, the name of the module is returned. This is unlike
        &quot;require_module&quot;, and is done so that the entire call to
        &quot;use_module&quot; can be used as a class name to call a
        constructor, as in the example in the synopsis.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="use_package_optimistically(NAME_,"><a class="permalink" href="#use_package_optimistically(NAME_,">use_package_optimistically(NAME[,
    VERSION])</a></dt>
  <dd>This is an analogue of &quot;use_module&quot; for the situation where
      there is uncertainty as to whether a package/class is defined in its own
      module or by some other means. It attempts to arrange for the named
      package to be available, either by loading a module or by doing nothing
      and hoping.
    <p class="Pp">An attempt is made to load the named module (as if by the
        bareword form of <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>). If the
        module cannot be found then it is assumed that the package was actually
        already loaded by other means, and no error is signalled. That's the
        optimistic bit.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>Warning:</i> this optional module loading is liable to
        cause unreliable behaviour, including security problems. It interacts
        especially badly with having <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> in
        <span class="Li">@INC</span>, which was the default state of affairs in
        Perls prior to 5.25.11. If a package is actually defined by some means
        other than a module, then applying this function to it causes a spurious
        attempt to load a module that is expected to be non-existent. If a
        module actually exists under that name then it will be unintentionally
        loaded. If <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> is in
        <span class="Li">@INC</span> and this code is ever run with the current
        directory being one writable by a malicious user (such as <i>/tmp</i>),
        then the malicious user can easily cause the victim to run arbitrary
        code, by creating a module file under the predictable spuriously-loaded
        name in the writable directory. Generally, optional module loading
        should be avoided.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is mostly the same operation that is performed by the
        base pragma to ensure that the specified base classes are available. The
        behaviour of base was simplified in version 2.18, and later improved in
        version 2.20, and on both occasions this function changed to match.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a <i>VERSION</i> is specified, the
        <span class="Li">&quot;VERSION&quot;</span> method of the loaded package
        is called with the specified <i>VERSION</i> as an argument. This
        normally serves to ensure that the version loaded is at least the
        version required. On success, the name of the package is returned. These
        aspects of the function work just like &quot;use_module&quot;.</p>

  <dd>This function is intended to make it more convenient for a user to specify
      a Perl module name at runtime. Users have greater need for abbreviations
      and context-sensitivity than programmers, and Perl module names get a
      little unwieldy. <i>SPEC</i> is what the user specifies, and this function
      translates it into a module name in standard form, which it returns.
    <p class="Pp"><i>SPEC</i> has syntax approximately that of a standard module
        name: it should consist of one or more name segments, each of which
        consists of one or more identifier characters. However,
        <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> is permitted as a separator, in
        addition to the standard <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span>. The two
        separators are entirely interchangeable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Additionally, if <i>PREFIX</i> is not
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> then it must be a module name
        in standard form, and it is prefixed to the user-specified name. The
        user can inhibit the prefix addition by starting <i>SPEC</i> with a
        separator (either <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span>).</p>

    break the heuristics used by &quot;use_package_optimistically&quot;, making
    it signal an error for a missing module rather than assume that it was
    already loaded. From Perl 5.8.9 onwards, and on 5.7.1 and earlier, this
    module can avoid being confused by such an override. On the affected
