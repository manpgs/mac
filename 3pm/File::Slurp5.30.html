<p class="Pp">This module provides subs that allow you to read or write entire
    files with one simple call. They are designed to be simple to use, have
    flexible ways to pass in or get the file contents and to be very efficient.
    There is also a sub to read in all the files in a directory.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">WARNING - PENDING DOOM</h2>
<p class="Pp">Although you technically <i>can</i>, do NOT use this module to
    work on file handles, pipes, sockets, standard IO, or the
    <span class="Li">&quot;DATA&quot;</span> handle. These are features
    implemented long ago that just really shouldn't be abused here.</p>
<p class="Pp">Be warned: this activity will lead to inaccurate encoding/decoding
    of data.</p>
<p class="Pp">All further mentions of actions on the above have been removed
    from this documentation and that feature set will likely be deprecated in
    the future.</p>
<p class="Pp">In other words, if you don't have a filename to pass, consider
    using the standard <span class="Li">&quot;do { local $/; &lt;$fh&gt;
    }&quot;</span>, or Data::Section/Data::Section::Simple for working with
    <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span>.</p>

<p class="Pp">File::Slurp implements the following functions.</p>

        my $res = write_file('/path/file', {append =&gt; 1}, &quot;Some text&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;append_file&quot;</span> function is
    simply a synonym for the &quot;write_file&quot; in File::Slurp function, but
    ensures that the <span class="Li">&quot;append&quot;</span> option is
  set.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;edit_file&quot;</span> function reads
    in a file into <span class="Li">$_</span>, executes a code block that should
    modify <span class="Li">$_</span>, and then writes
    <span class="Li">$_</span> back to the file. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;edit_file&quot;</span> function reads in the entire
    file and calls the code block one time. It is equivalent to the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-pi&quot;</span> command line options of Perl but you
    can call it from inside your program and not have to fork out a process.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first argument to
    <span class="Li">&quot;edit_file&quot;</span> is a code block or a code
    reference. The code block is not followed by a comma (as with
    <span class="Li">&quot;grep&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;map&quot;</span>) but a code reference is followed by
    a comma.</p>
<p class="Pp">The next argument is the filename.</p>
<p class="Pp">The next argument(s) is either a hash reference or a flattened
    hash, <span class="Li">&quot;key =&gt; value&quot;</span> pairs. The options
    are passed through to the &quot;write_file&quot; in File::Slurp function.
    All options are described there. Only the
    <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;err_mode&quot;</span> options are supported. The call
    to &quot;write_file&quot; in File::Slurp has the

  </li>
  <li>keep_dot_dot
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;keep_dot_dot&quot;</span> option is

        Setting this option to true (<span class="Li">1</span>) will also return

<p class="Pp">This function reads in an entire file and returns its contents to
    the caller. In scalar context it returns the entire file as a single scalar.
    In list context it will return a list of lines (using the current value of
    <span class="Li">$/</span> as the separator, including support for paragraph
    mode when it is set to <span class="Li">''</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The first argument is the path to the file to be slurped in.</p>
<p class="Pp">The next argument(s) is either a hash reference or a flattened
    hash, <span class="Li">&quot;key =&gt; value&quot;</span> pairs. The
    following options are available:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>array_ref
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;array_ref&quot;</span> option is a
        boolean option, defaulted to false (<span class="Li">0</span>). Setting
        this option to true (<span class="Li">1</span>) will only have relevance
        if the <span class="Li">&quot;read_file&quot;</span> function is called
        in scalar context. When true, the
        <span class="Li">&quot;read_file&quot;</span> function will return a
        reference to an array of the lines in the file.</p>
  </li>
  <li>binmode
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> option is a
        string option, defaulted to empty (<span class="Li">''</span>). If you
        set the <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> option, then its
        value is passed to a call to <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span>
        on the opened handle. You can use this to set the file to be read in
        binary mode, utf8, etc. See <span class="Li">&quot;perldoc -f
        binmode&quot;</span> for more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>blk_size
    <p class="Pp">You can use this option to set the block size used when
        slurping from an already open handle (like
        <span class="Li">&quot;\*STDIN&quot;</span>). It defaults to 1MB.</p>
  </li>
  <li>buf_ref
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;buf_ref&quot;</span> option can be
        used in conjunction with any of the other options. You can use this
        option to pass in a scalar reference and the slurped file contents will
        be stored in the scalar. This saves an extra copy of the slurped file
        and can lower RAM usage vs returning the file. It is usually the fastest
        way to read a file into a scalar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>chomp
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;chomp&quot;</span> option is a
        boolean option, defaulted to false (<span class="Li">0</span>). Setting
        this option to true (<span class="Li">1</span>) will cause each line to
        have its contents <span class="Li">&quot;chomp&quot;</span>ed. This
        option works in list context or in scalar context with the
        <span class="Li">&quot;array_ref&quot;</span> option.</p>
  </li>
  <li>err_mode
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;err_mode&quot;</span> option has
        three possible values: <span class="Li">&quot;quiet&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;carp&quot;</span>, or the default,
        <span class="Li">&quot;croak&quot;</span>. In

        silent. In <span class="Li">&quot;carp&quot;</span> mode, all errors
        will be emitted as warnings. And, in
        <span class="Li">&quot;croak&quot;</span> mode, all errors will be
        emitted as exceptions. Take a look at Try::Tiny or Syntax::Keyword::Try
        to see how to catch exceptions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>scalar_ref
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;scalar_ref&quot;</span> option is a
        boolean option, defaulted to false (<span class="Li">0</span>). It only
        has meaning in scalar context. The return value will be a scalar
        reference to a string which is the contents of the slurped file. This
        will usually be faster than returning the plain scalar. It will also
        save memory as it will not make a copy of the file to return.</p>

<p class="Pp">The next argument(s) is either a hash reference or a flattened
    hash, <span class="Li">&quot;key =&gt; value&quot;</span> pairs. The
    following options are available:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>append
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;append&quot;</span> option is a
        boolean option, defaulted to false (<span class="Li">0</span>). Setting
        this option to true (<span class="Li">1</span>) will cause the data to
        be be written at the end of the current file. Internally this sets the
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span> mode flag
        <span class="Li">&quot;O_APPEND&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The &quot;append_file&quot; in File::Slurp function sets this
        option by default.</p>
  </li>
  <li>atomic
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;atomic&quot;</span> option is a
        boolean option, defaulted to false (<span class="Li">0</span>). Setting
        this option to true (<span class="Li">1</span>) will cause the file to
        be be written to in an atomic fashion. A temporary file name is created
        using &quot;tempfile&quot; in File::Temp. After the file is closed it is
        renamed to the original file name (and
        <span class="Li">&quot;rename&quot;</span> is an atomic operation on
        most OSes). If the program using this were to crash in the middle of
        this, then the temporary file could be left behind.</p>
  </li>
  <li>binmode
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> option is a
        string option, defaulted to empty (<span class="Li">''</span>). If you
        set the <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> option, then its
        value is passed to a call to <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span>
        on the opened handle. You can use this to set the file to be read in
        binary mode, utf8, etc. See <span class="Li">&quot;perldoc -f
        binmode&quot;</span> for more.</p>
  </li>
  <li>buf_ref
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;buf_ref&quot;</span> option is used
        to pass in a scalar reference which has the data to be written. If this
        is set then any data arguments (including the scalar reference shortcut)
        in <span class="Li">@_</span> will be ignored.</p>
  </li>
  <li>err_mode
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;err_mode&quot;</span> option has
        three possible values: <span class="Li">&quot;quiet&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;carp&quot;</span>, or the default,
        <span class="Li">&quot;croak&quot;</span>. In
        <span class="Li">&quot;quiet&quot;</span> mode, all errors will be
        silent. In <span class="Li">&quot;carp&quot;</span> mode, all errors
        will be emitted as warnings. And, in
        <span class="Li">&quot;croak&quot;</span> mode, all errors will be
        emitted as exceptions. Take a look at Try::Tiny or Syntax::Keyword::Try
        to see how to catch exceptions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>no_clobber
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;no_clobber&quot;</span> option is a
        boolean option, defaulted to false (<span class="Li">0</span>). Setting
        this option to true (<span class="Li">1</span>) will ensure an that
        existing file will not be overwritten.</p>
  </li>
  <li>perms
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;perms&quot;</span> option sets the
        permissions of newly-created files. This value is modified by your
        process's <span class="Li">&quot;umask&quot;</span> and defaults to
        <span class="Li">0666</span> (same as
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span>).</p>
    <p class="Pp">NOTE: this option is new as of File::Slurp version
      9999.14.</p>
