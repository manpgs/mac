<p class="Pp">Type::Tiny::Manual::UsingWithMouse - how to use Type::Tiny with
    Mouse</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MANUAL"><a class="permalink" href="#MANUAL">MANUAL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">First read Type::Tiny::Manual::Moo, Type::Tiny::Manual::Moo2, and
    Type::Tiny::Manual::Moo3. Everything in those parts of the manual should
    work exactly the same in Mouse.</p>
<p class="Pp">This part of the manual will focus on Mouse-specifics.</p>
<p class="Pp">Overall, Type::Tiny is less well-tested with Mouse than it is with
    Moose and Moo, but there are still a good number of test cases for using
    Type::Tiny with Mouse, and there are no known major issues with Type::Tiny's
    Mouse support.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Why_Use_Type::Tiny_At_All?"><a class="permalink" href="#Why_Use_Type::Tiny_At_All?">Why
  Use Type::Tiny At All?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Mouse does have a built-in type constraint system which is fairly
    convenient to use, but there are several reasons you should consider using
    Type::Tiny instead.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Type::Tiny provides helpful methods like
      <span class="Li">&quot;where&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;plus_coercions&quot;</span> that allow type
      constraints and coercions to be easily tweaked on a per-attribute basis.
    <p class="Pp">Something like this is much harder to do with plain Mouse
        types:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  has name =&gt; (
    is      =&gt; &quot;ro&quot;,
    isa     =&gt; Str-&gt;plus_coercions(
      ArrayRef[Str], sub { join &quot; &quot;, @$_ },
    ),
    coerce  =&gt; 1,
  );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Mouse tends to encourage defining coercions globally, so if
        you wanted one <b>Str</b> attribute to be able to coerce from
        <b>ArrayRef[Str]</b>, then <i>all</i> <b>Str</b> attributes would coerce
        from <b>ArrayRef[Str]</b>, and they'd all do that coercion in the same
        way. (Even if it might make sense to join by a space in some places, a
        comma in others, and a line break in others!)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Type::Tiny provides automatic deep coercions, so if type <b>Xyz</b> has a
      coercion, the following should &quot;just work&quot;:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  isa xyzlist =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'ro', isa =&gt; ArrayRef[Xyz], coerce =&gt; 1 );
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Type::Tiny offers a wider selection of built-in types.</li>
  <li>By using Type::Tiny, you can use the same type constraints and coercions
      for attributes and method parameters, in Mouse and non-Mouse code.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Type::Utils"><a class="permalink" href="#Type::Utils">Type::Utils</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If you've used Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints, you may be accustomed
    to using a DSL for declaring type constraints:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use Mouse::Util::TypeConstraints;
  
  subtype 'Natural',
    as 'Int',
    where { $_ &gt; 0 };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There's a module called Type::Utils that provides a very similar
    DSL for declaring types in Type::Library-based type libraries.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  package My::Types {
    use Type::Library -base;
    use Type::Utils;
    use Types::Standard qw( Int );
    
    declare 'Natural',
      as Int,
      where { $_ &gt; 0 };
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Personally I prefer the more object-oriented way to declare types
    though.</p>
<p class="Pp">In Mouse you might also declare types like this within classes and
    roles too. Unlike Mouse, Type::Tiny doesn't keep types in a single global
    flat namespace, so this doesn't work quite the same with Type::Utils. It
    still creates the type, but it doesn't store it in any type library; the
    type is returned.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  package My::Class {
    use Mouse;
    use Type::Utils;
    use Types::Standard qw( Int );
    
    my $Natural =          # store type in a variable
      declare 'Natural',
      as Int,
      where { $_ &gt; 0 };
    
    has number =&gt; ( is =&gt; 'ro', isa =&gt; $Natural );
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But really, isn't the object-oriented way cleaner?</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  package My::Class {
    use Mouse;
    use Types::Standard qw( Int );
    
    has number =&gt; (
      is   =&gt; 'ro',
      isa  =&gt; Int-&gt;where('$_ &gt; 0'),
    );
  }
</pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Type::Tiny_and_MouseX::Types"><a class="permalink" href="#Type::Tiny_and_MouseX::Types">Type::Tiny
  and MouseX::Types</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Types::Standard should be a drop-in replacement for MooseX::Types.
    And Types::Common::Numeric and Types::Common::String should easily replace
    MouseX::Types::Common::Numeric and MouseX::Types::Common::String.</p>
<p class="Pp">That said, if you do with to use a mixture of Type::Tiny and
    MouseX::Types, they should fit together pretty seamlessly.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use Types::Standard qw( ArrayRef );
  use MouseX::Types::Mouse qw( Int );
  
  # this should just work
  my $list_of_nums = ArrayRef[Int];
  
  # and this
  my $list_or_num = ArrayRef | Int;
</pre>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_"><a class="permalink" href="#_">&quot;-mouse&quot; Import
  Parameter</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If you have read this far in the manual, you will know that this
    is the usual way to import type constraints:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use Types::Standard qw( Int );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And the <span class="Li">&quot;Int&quot;</span> which is imported
    is a function that takes no arguments and returns the <b>Int</b> type
    constraint, which is a blessed object in the Type::Tiny class.</p>
<p class="Pp">Type::Tiny mocks the Mouse::Meta::TypeConstraint API so well that
    most Mouse and MouseX code will not be able to tell the difference.</p>
<p class="Pp">But what if you need a real Mouse::Meta::TypeConstraint
  object?</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use Types::Standard -mouse, qw( Int );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now the <span class="Li">&quot;Int&quot;</span> function imported
    will return a genuine native Mouse type constraint.</p>
<p class="Pp">This flag is mostly a throwback from when Type::Tiny native
    objects <i>didn't</i> directly work in Mouse. In 99.9% of cases, there is no
    reason to use it and plenty of reasons not to. (Mouse native type
    constraints don't offer helpful methods like
    <span class="Li">&quot;plus_coercions&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;where&quot;</span>.)</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_mouse_type__Method"><a class="permalink" href="#_mouse_type__Method">&quot;mouse_type&quot;
  Method</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Another quick way to get a native Mouse type constraint object
    from a Type::Tiny object is to call the
    <span class="Li">&quot;mouse_type&quot;</span> method:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use Types::Standard qw( Int );
  
  my $tiny_type   = Int;
  my $mouse_type  = $tiny_type-&gt;mouse_type;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Internally, this is what the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-mouse&quot;</span> flag makes imported functions
  do.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Type::Tiny_Performance"><a class="permalink" href="#Type::Tiny_Performance">Type::Tiny
  Performance</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Type::Tiny should run pretty much as fast as Mouse types do. This
    is because, when possible, it will use Mouse's XS implementations of type
    checks to do the heavy lifting.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are a few type constraints where Type::Tiny prefers to do
    things without Mouse's help though, for consistency and correctness. For
    example, the Mouse XS implementation of <b>Bool</b> is... strange... it
    accepts blessed objects that overload
    <span class="Li">&quot;bool&quot;</span>, but only if they return false. If
    they return true, it's a type constraint error.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using Type::Tiny instead of Mouse's type constraints shouldn't
    make a significant difference to the performance of your code.</p>
