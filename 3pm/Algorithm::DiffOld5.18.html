<p class="Pp">Algorithm::DiffOld - Compute `intelligent' differences between two
    files / lists but use the old (&lt;=0.59) interface.</p>

<p class="Pp">This has been provided as part of the Algorithm::Diff package by
    Ned Konz. This particular module is <b>ONLY</b> for people who <b>HAVE</b>
    to have the old interface, which uses a comparison function rather than a
    key generating function.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because each of the lines in one array have to be compared with
    each of the lines in the other array, this does M*N comparisions. This can
    be very slow. I clocked it at taking 18 times as long as the stock version
    of Algorithm::Diff for a 4000-line file. It will get worse quadratically as
    array sizes increase.</p>

  FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Each of the main routines should be passed a comparison function.
    If you aren't passing one in, <b>use Algorithm::Diff instead</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">These functions should return a true value when two items should
    compare as equal.</p>
<p class="Pp">For instance,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  @lcs    = LCS( \@seq1, \@seq2, sub { my ($a, $b) = @_; $a eq $b } );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">but if that is all you're doing with your comparison function,
    just use Algorithm::Diff and let it do this (this is its default).</p>
<p class="Pp">Or:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  sub someFunkyComparisonFunction
  {
        my ($a, $b) = @_;
        $a =~ m{$b};
  }

  @diffs = diff( \@lines, \@patterns, \&amp;someFunkyComparisonFunction );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which would allow you to diff an array
    <span class="Li">@lines</span> which consists of text lines with an array
    <span class="Li">@patterns</span> which consists of regular expressions.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is actually the reason I wrote this version -- there is no
    way to do this with a key generation function as in the stock
    Algorithm::Diff.</p>
