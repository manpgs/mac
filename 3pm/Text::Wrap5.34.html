<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Text::Wrap::wrap()&quot;</span> is a very
    simple paragraph formatter. It formats a single paragraph at a time by
    breaking lines at word boundaries. Indentation is controlled for the first
    line (<span class="Li">$initial_tab</span>) and all subsequent lines
    (<span class="Li">$subsequent_tab</span>) independently. Please note:
    <span class="Li">$initial_tab</span> and
    <span class="Li">$subsequent_tab</span> are the literal strings that will be
    used: it is unlikely you would want to pass in a number.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Text::Wrap::fill()&quot;</span> is a simple
    multi-paragraph formatter. It formats each paragraph separately and then
    joins them together when it's done. It will destroy any whitespace in the
    original text. It breaks text into paragraphs by looking for whitespace
    after a newline. In other respects, it acts like <b>wrap()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;wrap()&quot;</span> compresses trailing
    whitespace into one newline, and <span class="Li">&quot;fill()&quot;</span>
    deletes all trailing whitespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both <span class="Li">&quot;wrap()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;fill()&quot;</span> return a single string.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike the old Unix <b>fmt</b>(1) utility, this module correctly
    accounts for any Unicode combining characters (such as diacriticals) that
    may occur in each line for both expansion and unexpansion. These are
    overstrike characters that do not increment the logical position. Make sure
    you have the appropriate Unicode settings enabled.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OVERRIDES"><a class="permalink" href="#OVERRIDES">OVERRIDES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Text::Wrap::wrap()&quot;</span> has a
    number of variables that control its behavior. Because other modules might
    be using <span class="Li">&quot;Text::Wrap::wrap()&quot;</span> it is
    suggested that you leave these variables alone! If you can't do that, then
    use <span class="Li">&quot;local($Text::Wrap::VARIABLE) =
    YOURVALUE&quot;</span> when you change the values so that the original value
    is restored. This <span class="Li">&quot;local()&quot;</span> trick will not
    work if you import the variable into your own namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">Lines are wrapped at <span class="Li">$Text::Wrap::columns</span>
    columns (default value: 76). <span class="Li">$Text::Wrap::columns</span>
    should be set to the full width of your output device. In fact, every
    resulting line will have length of no more than
    <span class="Li">&quot;$columns - 1&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is possible to control which characters terminate words by
    modifying <span class="Li">$Text::Wrap::break</span>. Set this to a string
    such as <span class="Li">'[\s:]'</span> (to break before spaces or colons)
    or a pre-compiled regexp such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;qr/[\s']/&quot;</span> (to break before spaces or
    apostrophes). The default is simply <span class="Li">'\s'</span>; that is,
    words are terminated by spaces. (This means, among other things, that
    trailing punctuation such as full stops or commas stay with the word they
    are &quot;attached&quot; to.) Setting
    <span class="Li">$Text::Wrap::break</span> to a regular expression that
    doesn't eat any characters (perhaps just a forward look-ahead assertion)
    will cause warnings.</p>
<p class="Pp">Beginner note: In example 2, above
    <span class="Li">$columns</span> is imported into the local namespace, and
    set locally. In example 3, <span class="Li">$Text::Wrap::columns</span> is
    set in its own namespace without importing it.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Text::Wrap::wrap()&quot;</span> starts its
    work by expanding all the tabs in its input into spaces. The last thing it
    does it to turn spaces back into tabs. If you do not want tabs in your
    results, set <span class="Li">$Text::Wrap::unexpand</span> to a false value.
    Likewise if you do not want to use 8-character tabstops, set
    <span class="Li">$Text::Wrap::tabstop</span> to the number of characters you
    do want for your tabstops.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to separate your lines with something other than
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> then set
    <span class="Li">$Text::Wrap::separator</span> to your preference. This
    replaces all newlines with <span class="Li">$Text::Wrap::separator</span>.
    If you just want to preserve existing newlines but add new breaks with
    something else, set <span class="Li">$Text::Wrap::separator2</span>
  instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">When words that are longer than <span class="Li">$columns</span>
    are encountered, they are broken up.
    <span class="Li">&quot;wrap()&quot;</span> adds a
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> at column
    <span class="Li">$columns</span>. This behavior can be overridden by setting
    <span class="Li">$huge</span> to 'die' or to 'overflow'. When set to 'die',
    large words will cause <span class="Li">&quot;die()&quot;</span> to be
    called. When set to 'overflow', large words will be left intact.</p>
<p class="Pp">Historical notes: 'die' used to be the default value of
    <span class="Li">$huge</span>. Now, 'wrap' is the default value.</p>

<p class="Pp">This module comes in two flavors: one for modern perls (5.10 and
    above) and one for ancient obsolete perls. The version for modern perls has
    support for Unicode. The version for old perls does not. You can tell which
    version you have installed by looking at
    <span class="Li">$Text::Wrap::SUBVERSION</span>: it is
    <span class="Li">&quot;old&quot;</span> for obsolete perls and
    <span class="Li">&quot;modern&quot;</span> for current perls.</p>
<p class="Pp">This man page is for the version for modern perls and so that's
    probably what you've got.</p>
