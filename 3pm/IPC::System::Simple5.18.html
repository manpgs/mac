<p class="Pp">Calling Perl's in-built
    <span class="Li">&quot;system()&quot;</span> function is easy, determining
    if it was successful is <i>hard</i>. Let's face it,
    <span class="Li">$?</span> isn't the nicest variable in the world to play
    with, and even if you <i>do</i> check it, producing a well-formatted error
    string takes a lot of work.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;IPC::System::Simple&quot;</span> takes the
    hard work out of calling external commands. In fact, if you want to be
    really lazy, you can just write:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use IPC::System::Simple qw(system);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and all of your <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span>
    commands will either succeed (run to completion and return a zero exit
    value), or die with rich diagnostic messages.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;IPC::System::Simple&quot;</span> module
    also provides a simple replacement to Perl's backticks operator. Simply
    write:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use IPC::System::Simple qw(capture);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and then use the &quot;<i>capture()</i>&quot; command just like
    you'd use backticks. If there's an error, it will die with a detailed
    description of what went wrong. Better still, you can even use
    <span class="Li">&quot;capturex()&quot;</span> to run the equivalent of
    backticks, but without the shell:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use IPC::System::Simple qw(capturex);

    my $result = capturex($command, @args);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you want more power than the basic interface, including the
    ability to specify which exit values are acceptable, trap errors, or process
    diagnostics, then read on!</p>

  USAGE</a></h1>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss"><i>run()</i> and <i>system()</i></h2>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;IPC::System::Simple&quot;</span> provides a
    subroutine called <span class="Li">&quot;run&quot;</span>, that executes a
    command using the same semantics as Perl's built-in
    <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use IPC::System::Simple qw(run);

    run(&quot;cat *.txt&quot;);           # Execute command via the shell
    run(&quot;cat&quot;,&quot;/etc/motd&quot;);     # Execute command without shell
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The primary difference between Perl's in-built system and the
    <span class="Li">&quot;run&quot;</span> command is that
    <span class="Li">&quot;run&quot;</span> will throw an exception on failure,
    and allows a list of acceptable exit values to be set. See &quot;Exit
    values&quot; for further information.</p>
<p class="Pp">In fact, you can even have
    <span class="Li">&quot;IPC::System::Simple&quot;</span> replace the default
    <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> function for your package so it
    has the same behaviour:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use IPC::System::Simple qw(system);

    system(&quot;cat *.txt&quot;);  # system now succeeds or dies!
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;run&quot;</span> are aliases to each other.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also &quot;<i>runx()</i>, <i>systemx()</i> and
    <i>capturex()</i>&quot; for variants of
    <span class="Li">&quot;system()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;run()&quot;</span> that never invoke the shell, even
    with a single argument.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss"><i>capture()</i></h2>
<p class="Pp">A second subroutine, named
    <span class="Li">&quot;capture&quot;</span> executes a command with the same
    semantics as Perl's built-in backticks (and
    <span class="Li">&quot;qx()&quot;</span>):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use IPC::System::Simple qw(capture);

    # Capture text while invoking the shell.
    my $file  = capture(&quot;cat /etc/motd&quot;);
    my @lines = capture(&quot;cat /etc/passwd&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However unlike regular backticks, which always use the shell,
    <span class="Li">&quot;capture&quot;</span> will bypass the shell when
    called with multiple arguments:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    # Capture text while avoiding the shell.
    my $file  = capture(&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;/etc/motd&quot;);
    my @lines = capture(&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;/etc/passwd&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">See also &quot;<i>runx()</i>, <i>systemx()</i> and
    <i>capturex()</i>&quot; for a variant of
    <span class="Li">&quot;capture()&quot;</span> that never invokes the shell,
    even with a single argument.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss"><i>runx()</i>, <i>systemx()</i> and <i>capturex()</i></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;runx()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;systemx()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;capturex()&quot;</span> commands are identical to the
    multi-argument forms of <span class="Li">&quot;run()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;system()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;capture()&quot;</span> respectively, but <i>never</i>
    invoke the shell, even when called with a single argument. These forms are
    particularly useful when a command's argument list <i>might</i> be empty,
    for example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    systemx($cmd, @args);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The use of <span class="Li">&quot;systemx()&quot;</span> here
    guarantees that the shell will <i>never</i> be invoked, even if

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Exception_handling"><a class="permalink" href="#Exception_handling">Exception

<p class="Pp">In the case where the command returns an unexpected status, both
    <span class="Li">&quot;run&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;capture&quot;</span> will throw an exception, which
    if not caught will terminate your program with an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">Capturing the exception is easy:</p>

<pre>
    eval {
        run(&quot;cat *.txt&quot;);

<p class="Pp">See the diagnostics section below for more details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Exception cases</i></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;IPC::System::Simple&quot;</span> considers
    the following to be unexpected, and worthy of exception:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Failing to start entirely (eg, command not found, permission denied).</li>
  <li>Returning an exit value other than zero (but see below).</li>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Exit_values"><a class="permalink" href="#Exit_values">Exit

<p class="Pp">Traditionally, system commands return a zero status for success
    and a non-zero status for failure.
    <span class="Li">&quot;IPC::System::Simple&quot;</span> will default to
    throwing an exception if a non-zero exit value is returned.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may specify a range of values which are considered acceptable
    exit values by passing an <i>array reference</i> as the first argument. The
    special constant <span class="Li">&quot;EXIT_ANY&quot;</span> can be used to
    allow <i>any</i> exit value to be returned.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
        use IPC::System::Simple qw(run system capture EXIT_ANY);

        run( [0..5], &quot;cat *.txt&quot;);             # Exit values 0-5 are OK

</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;run&quot;</span> and replacement

</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>$EXITVAL</i><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">The exit value of any command executed by
    <span class="Li">&quot;IPC::System::Simple&quot;</span> can always be

<p class="Pp">This is particularly useful when inspecting results from

<h2 class="Ss" id="WINDOWS-SPECIFIC_"><a class="permalink" href="#WINDOWS-SPECIFIC_">WINDOWS-SPECIFIC
  NOTES</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As of <span class="Li">&quot;IPC::System::Simple&quot;</span>
    v0.06, the <span class="Li">&quot;run&quot;</span> subroutine <i>when</i>
    <i>called with multiple arguments</i> will make available the full 32-bit
    exit value on Win32 systems. This is different from the previous versions of
    <span class="Li">&quot;IPC::System::Simple&quot;</span> and from Perl's
    in-build <span class="Li">&quot;system()&quot;</span> function, which can
    only handle 8-bit return values.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;capture&quot;</span> subroutine always
    returns the 32-bit exit value under Windows. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;capture&quot;</span> subroutine also never uses the
    shell, even when passed a single argument.</p>
<p class="Pp">Versions of
    <span class="Li">&quot;IPC::System::Simple&quot;</span> before v0.09 would
    not search the <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span> environment variable
    when the multi-argument form of <span class="Li">&quot;run()&quot;</span>
    was called. Versions from v0.09 onwards correctly search the path provided
    the command is provided including the extension (eg,
    <span class="Li">&quot;notepad.exe&quot;</span> rather than just
    <span class="Li">&quot;notepad&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;gvim.bat&quot;</span> rather than just
    <span class="Li">&quot;gvim&quot;</span>). If no extension is provided,
    <span class="Li">&quot;.exe&quot;</span> is assumed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Signals are not supported on Windows systems. Sending a signal to
    a Windows process will usually cause it to exit with the signal number
  used.</p>
