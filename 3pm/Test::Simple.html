<p class="Pp">** If you are unfamiliar with testing <b>read Test::Tutorial
    first!</b> **</p>
<p class="Pp">This is an extremely simple, extremely basic module for writing
    tests suitable for CPAN modules and other pursuits. If you wish to do more
    complicated testing, use the Test::More module (a drop-in replacement for
    this one).</p>
<p class="Pp">The basic unit of Perl testing is the ok. For each thing you want
    to test your program will print out an &quot;ok&quot; or &quot;not ok&quot;
    to indicate pass or fail. You do this with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span> function (see below).</p>
<p class="Pp">The only other constraint is you must pre-declare how many tests
    you plan to run. This is in case something goes horribly wrong during the
    test and your test program aborts, or skips a test or whatever. You do this
    like so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 23;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You must have a plan.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="ok"><a class="permalink" href="#ok"><b>ok</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
  ok( $foo eq $bar, $name );
  ok( $foo eq $bar );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span> is given an
        expression (in this case <span class="Li">&quot;$foo eq
        $bar&quot;</span>). If it's true, the test passed. If it's false, it
        didn't. That's about it.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span> prints out either
        &quot;ok&quot; or &quot;not ok&quot; along with a test number (it keeps
        track of that for you).</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  # This produces &quot;ok 1 - Hell not yet frozen over&quot; (or not ok)
  ok( get_temperature($hell) &gt; 0, 'Hell not yet frozen over' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you provide a <span class="Li">$name</span>, that will be
        printed along with the &quot;ok/not ok&quot; to make it easier to find
        your test when if fails (just search for the name). It also makes it
        easier for the next guy to understand what your test is for. It's highly
        recommended you use test names.</p>
    <p class="Pp">All tests are run in scalar context. So this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    ok( @stuff, 'I have some stuff' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will do what you mean (fail if stuff is empty)</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Test::Simple will start by printing number of tests run in the
    form &quot;1..M&quot; (so &quot;1..5&quot; means you're going to run 5
    tests). This strange format lets Test::Harness know how many tests you plan
    on running in case something goes horribly wrong.</p>
<p class="Pp">If all your tests passed, Test::Simple will exit with zero (which
    is normal). If anything failed it will exit with how many failed. If you run
    less (or more) tests than you planned, the missing (or extras) will be
    considered failures. If no tests were ever run Test::Simple will throw a
    warning and exit with 255. If the test died, even after having successfully
    completed all its tests, it will still be considered a failure and will exit
    with 255.</p>
<p class="Pp">So the exit codes are...</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    0                   all tests successful
    255                 test died or all passed but wrong # of tests run
    any other number    how many failed (including missing or extras)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you fail more than 254 tests, it will be reported as 254.</p>
<p class="Pp">This module is by no means trying to be a complete testing system.
    It's just to get you started. Once you're off the ground its recommended you
    look at Test::More.</p>

<p class="Pp">Here's an example of a simple .t file for the fictional Film
    module.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 5;

    use Film;  # What you're testing.

    my $btaste = Film-&gt;new({ Title    =&gt; 'Bad Taste',
                             Director =&gt; 'Peter Jackson',
                             Rating   =&gt; 'R',
                             NumExplodingSheep =&gt; 1
                           });
    ok( defined($btaste) &amp;&amp; ref $btaste eq 'Film',     'new() works' );

    ok( $btaste-&gt;Title      eq 'Bad Taste',     'Title() get'    );
    ok( $btaste-&gt;Director   eq 'Peter Jackson', 'Director() get' );
    ok( $btaste-&gt;Rating     eq 'R',             'Rating() get'   );
    ok( $btaste-&gt;NumExplodingSheep == 1,        'NumExplodingSheep() get' );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It will produce output like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    1..5
    ok 1 - new() works
    ok 2 - Title() get
    ok 3 - Director() get
    not ok 4 - Rating() get
    #   Failed test 'Rating() get'
    #   in t/film.t at line 14.
    ok 5 - NumExplodingSheep() get
    # Looks like you failed 1 tests of 5
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Indicating the <b>Film::Rating()</b> method is broken.</p>

<p class="Pp">Test::Simple will only report a maximum of 254 failures in its
    exit code. If this is a problem, you probably have a huge test script. Split
    it into multiple files. (Otherwise blame the Unix folks for using an
    unsigned short integer as the exit status).</p>
<p class="Pp">Because VMS's exit codes are much, much different than the rest of
    the universe, and perl does horrible mangling to them that gets in my way,
    it works like this on VMS.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    0     SS$_NORMAL        all tests successful
    4     SS$_ABORT         something went wrong

<p class="Pp">This module was conceived while talking with Tony Bowden in his
    kitchen one night about the problems I was having writing some really
    complicated feature into the new Testing module. He observed that the main
    problem is not dealing with these edge cases but that people hate to write
    tests <b>at all</b>. What was needed was a dead simple module that took all
    the hard work out of testing and was really, really easy to learn. Paul
    Johnson simultaneously had this idea (unfortunately, he wasn't in Tony's
    kitchen). This is it.</p>

  <dd>More testing functions! Once you outgrow Test::Simple, look at Test::More.
      Test::Simple is 100% forward compatible with Test::More (i.e. you can just
      use Test::More instead of Test::Simple in your programs and things will
      still work).</dd>
