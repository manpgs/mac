<p class="Pp">Capture::Tiny provides a simple, portable way to capture almost
    anything sent to STDOUT or STDERR, regardless of whether it comes from Perl,
    from XS code or from an external program. Optionally, output can be teed so
    that it is captured while being passed through to the original filehandles.
    Yes, it even works on Windows (usually). Stop guessing which of a dozen
    capturing modules to use in any particular situation and just use this
  one.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="USAGE"><a class="permalink" href="#USAGE">USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The following functions are available. None are exported by
    default.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="capture"><a class="permalink" href="#capture">capture</a></h2>
<pre>
   ($stdout, $stderr, @result) = capture \&amp;code;
   $stdout = capture \&amp;code;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;capture&quot;</span> function takes a
    code reference and returns what is sent to STDOUT and STDERR as well as any
    return values from the code reference. In scalar context, it returns only
    STDOUT. If no output was received for a filehandle, it returns an empty
    string for that filehandle. Regardless of calling context, all output is
    captured -- nothing is passed to the existing filehandles.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is prototyped to take a subroutine reference as an argument.
    Thus, it can be called in block form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   ($stdout, $stderr) = capture {
     # your code here ...
   };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that the coderef is evaluated in list context. If you wish to
    force scalar context on the return value, you must use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;scalar&quot;</span> keyword.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   ($stdout, $stderr, $count) = capture {
     my @list = qw/one two three/;
     return scalar @list; # $count will be 3
   };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Also note that within the coderef, the <span class="Li">@_</span>
    variable will be empty. So don't use arguments from a surrounding subroutine
    without copying them to an array first:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   sub wont_work {
     my ($stdout, $stderr) = capture { do_stuff( @_ ) };    # WRONG
     ...
   }
 
   sub will_work {
     my @args = @_;
     my ($stdout, $stderr) = capture { do_stuff( @args ) }; # RIGHT
     ...
   }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Captures are normally done to an anonymous temporary filehandle.
    To capture via a named file (e.g. to externally monitor a long-running
    capture), provide custom filehandles as a trailing list of option pairs:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   my $out_fh = IO::File-&gt;new(&quot;out.txt&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;);
   my $err_fh = IO::File-&gt;new(&quot;out.txt&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;);
   capture { ... } stdout =&gt; $out_fh, stderr =&gt; $err_fh;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The filehandles must be read/write and seekable. Modifying the
    files or filehandles during a capture operation will give unpredictable
    results. Existing IO layers on them may be changed by the capture.</p>
<p class="Pp">When called in void context,
    <span class="Li">&quot;capture&quot;</span> saves memory and time by not
    reading back from the capture handles.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="PerlIO_layers"><a class="permalink" href="#PerlIO_layers">PerlIO
  layers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Capture::Tiny does it's best to preserve PerlIO layers such as
    ':utf8' or ':crlf' when capturing (only for Perl 5.8.1+) . Layers should be
    applied to STDOUT or STDERR <i>before</i> the call to
    <span class="Li">&quot;capture&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;tee&quot;</span>. This may not work for tied
    filehandles (see below).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Modifying_filehandles_before_capturing"><a class="permalink" href="#Modifying_filehandles_before_capturing">Modifying
  filehandles before capturing</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Generally speaking, you should do little or no manipulation of the
    standard IO filehandles prior to using Capture::Tiny. In particular,
    closing, reopening, localizing or tying standard filehandles prior to
    capture may cause a variety of unexpected, undesirable and/or unreliable
    behaviors, as described below. Capture::Tiny does its best to compensate for
    these situations, but the results may not be what you desire.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Closed filehandles</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Capture::Tiny will work even if STDIN, STDOUT or STDERR have been
    previously closed. However, since they will be reopened to capture or tee
    output, any code within the captured block that depends on finding them
    closed will, of course, not find them to be closed. If they started closed,
    Capture::Tiny will close them again when the capture block finishes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that this reopening will happen even for STDIN or a
    filehandle not being captured to ensure that the filehandle used for capture
    is not opened to file descriptor 0, as this causes problems on various
    platforms.</p>
<p class="Pp">Prior to Perl 5.12, closed STDIN combined with PERL_UNICODE=D
    leaks filehandles and also breaks <i>tee()</i> for undiagnosed reasons. So
    don't do that.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Localized filehandles</b></p>
<p class="Pp">If code localizes any of Perl's standard filehandles before
    capturing, the capture will affect the localized filehandles and not the
    original ones. External system calls are not affected by localizing a
    filehandle in Perl and will continue to send output to the original
    filehandles (which will thus not be captured).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Scalar filehandles</b></p>
<p class="Pp">If STDOUT or STDERR are reopened to scalar filehandles prior to
    the call to <span class="Li">&quot;capture&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;tee&quot;</span>, then Capture::Tiny will override
    the output filehandle for the duration of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;capture&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;tee&quot;</span> call and then, for
    <span class="Li">&quot;tee&quot;</span>, send captured output to the output
    filehandle after the capture is complete. (Requires Perl 5.8)</p>
<p class="Pp">Capture::Tiny attempts to preserve the semantics of STDIN opened
    to a scalar reference, but note that external processes will not be able to
    read from such a handle. Capture::Tiny tries to ensure that external
    processes will read from the null device instead, but this is not
    guaranteed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tied output filehandles</b></p>
<p class="Pp">If STDOUT or STDERR are tied prior to the call to
    <span class="Li">&quot;capture&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;tee&quot;</span>, then Capture::Tiny will attempt to
    override the tie for the duration of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;capture&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;tee&quot;</span> call and then send captured output
    to the tied filehandle after the capture is complete. (Requires Perl
  5.8)</p>
<p class="Pp">Capture::Tiny may not succeed resending UTF-8 encoded data to a
    tied STDOUT or STDERR filehandle. Characters may appear as bytes. If the
    tied filehandle is based on Tie::StdHandle, then Capture::Tiny will attempt
    to determine appropriate layers like
    <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> from the underlying filehandle and
    do the right thing.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Tied input filehandle</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Capture::Tiny attempts to preserve the semantics of tied STDIN,
    but this requires Perl 5.8 and is not entirely predictable. External
    processes will not be able to read from such a handle.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless having STDIN tied is crucial, it may be safest to localize
    STDIN when capturing:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   my ($out, $err) = do { local *STDIN; capture { ... } };

<p class="Pp">Attempting to modify STDIN, STDOUT or STDERR <i>during</i>

    problems. Don't do that.</p>

    no longer recommend it.</p>
