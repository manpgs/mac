<p class="Pp">Test::Most exists to reduce boilerplate and to make your testing
    life easier. We provide &quot;one stop shopping&quot; for most commonly used
    testing modules. In fact, we often require the latest versions so that you
    get bug fixes through Test::Most and don't have to keep upgrading these
    modules separately.</p>
<p class="Pp">This module provides you with the most commonly used testing
    functions, along with automatically turning on strict and warning and gives
    you a bit more fine-grained control over your test suite.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use Test::Most tests =&gt; 4, 'die';
    ok 1, 'Normal calls to ok() should succeed';
    is 2, 2, '... as should all passing tests';
    eq_or_diff [3], [4], '... but failing tests should die';
    ok 4, '... will never get to here';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As you can see, the <span class="Li">&quot;eq_or_diff&quot;</span>
    test will fail. Because 'die' is in the import list, the test program will
    halt at that point.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you do not want strict and warnings enabled, you must
    explicitly disable them. Thus, you must be explicit about what you want and
    no longer need to worry about accidentally forgetting them.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use Test::Most tests =&gt; 4;
    no strict;
    no warnings;

<p class="Pp">All functions from the following modules will automatically be
    exported into your namespace:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Test::More</li>
  <li>Test::Exception</li>
  <li>Test::Differences</li>
  <li>Test::Deep</li>
  <li>Test::Warn</li>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FUNCTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Several other functions are also automatically exported:</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_die_on_fail_"><a class="permalink" href="#_die_on_fail_">&quot;die_on_fail&quot;</a></h2>
<pre> die_on_fail;
 is_deeply $foo, bar, '... we throw an exception if this fails';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This function, if called, will cause the test program to throw a
    Test::Most::Exception, effectively halting the test.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_bail_on_fail_"><a class="permalink" href="#_bail_on_fail_">&quot;bail_on_fail&quot;</a></h2>
<pre> bail_on_fail;
 is_deeply $foo, bar, '... we bail out if this fails';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This function, if called, will cause the test suite to
    <b>BAIL_OUT()</b> if any tests fail after it.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_restore_fail_"><a class="permalink" href="#_restore_fail_">&quot;restore_fail&quot;</a></h2>
<pre> die_on_fail;
 is_deeply $foo, bar, '... we throw an exception if this fails';
 restore_fail;
 cmp_bag(\@got, \@bag, '... we will not throw an exception if this fails';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This restores the original test failure behavior, so subsequent
    tests will no longer throw an exception or <b>BAIL_OUT()</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_set_failure_handler_"><a class="permalink" href="#_set_failure_handler_">&quot;set_failure_handler&quot;</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If you prefer other behavior to 'die_on_fail' or 'bail_on_fail',
    you can set your own failure handler:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> set_failure_handler( sub {
     my $builder = shift;
     if ( $builder &amp;&amp; $builder-&gt;{Test_Results}[-1] =~ /critical/ ) {
        send_admin_email(&quot;critical failure in tests&quot;);
     }
 } );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It receives the <span class="Li">&quot;Test::Builder&quot;</span>
    instance as its only argument.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Important</b>: Note that if the failing test is the very last
    test run, then the <span class="Li">$builder</span> will likely be
    undefined. This is an unfortunate side effect of how
    <span class="Li">&quot;Test::Builder&quot;</span> has been designed.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_explain_"><a class="permalink" href="#_explain_">&quot;explain&quot;</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Similar to <span class="Li">&quot;note()&quot;</span>, the output
    will only be seen by the user by using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-v&quot;</span> switch with
    <span class="Li">&quot;prove&quot;</span> or reading the raw TAP.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike <span class="Li">&quot;note()&quot;</span>, any reference
    in the argument list is automatically expanded using
    <span class="Li">&quot;Data::Dumper&quot;</span>. Thus, instead of this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> my $self = Some::Object-&gt;new($id);
 use Data::Dumper;
 explain 'I was just created', Dumper($self);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can now just do this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> my $self = Some::Object-&gt;new($id);
 explain 'I was just created:  ', $self;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That output will look similar to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> I was just created: bless( {
   'id' =&gt; 2,
   'stack' =&gt; []
 }, 'Some::Object' )
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that the &quot;dumpered&quot; output has the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Data::Dumper&quot;</span> variables
    <span class="Li">$Indent</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Sortkeys&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Terse&quot;</span> all set to the value of
    <span class="Li">1</span> (one). This allows for a much cleaner diagnostic
    output and at the present time cannot be overridden.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that Test::More's <span class="Li">&quot;explain&quot;</span>
    acts differently. This <span class="Li">&quot;explain&quot;</span> is
    equivalent to <span class="Li">&quot;note explain&quot;</span> in
    Test::More.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_show_"><a class="permalink" href="#_show_">&quot;show&quot;</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Experimental. Just like
    <span class="Li">&quot;explain&quot;</span>, but also tries to show you the
    lexical variable names:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> my $var   = 3;
 my @array = qw/ foo bar /;
 show $var, \@array;
 __END__
 $var = 3;
 @array = [
     'foo',
     'bar'
 ];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It will show <span class="Li">$VAR1</span>,
    <span class="Li">$VAR2</span> ... <span class="Li">$VAR_N</span> for every
    variable it cannot figure out the variable name to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> my @array = qw/ foo bar /;
 show @array;
 __END__
 $VAR1 = 'foo';
 $VAR2 = 'bar';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that this relies on Data::Dumper::Names version 0.03 or
    greater. If this is not present, it will warn and call explain instead.
    Also, it can only show the names for lexical variables. Globals such as
    <span class="Li">%ENV</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;%@&quot;</span> are
    not accessed via PadWalker and thus cannot be shown. It would be nice to
    find a workaround for this.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_always_explain__and__always_show_"><a class="permalink" href="#_always_explain__and__always_show_">&quot;always_explain&quot;
  and &quot;always_show&quot;</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">These are identical to <span class="Li">&quot;explain&quot;</span>
    and <span class="Li">&quot;show&quot;</span>, but like Test::More's
    <span class="Li">&quot;diag&quot;</span> function, these will always emit
    output, regardless of whether or not you're in verbose mode.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_all_done_"><a class="permalink" href="#_all_done_">&quot;all_done&quot;</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>DEPRECATED</b>. Use the new
    <span class="Li">&quot;done_testing()&quot;</span> (added in Test::More
    since 0.87_01). Instead. We're leaving this in here for a long deprecation
    cycle. After a while, we might even start warning.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the plan is specified as
    <span class="Li">&quot;defer_plan&quot;</span>, you may call
    <span class="Li">&amp;all_done</span> at the end of the test with an
    optional test number. This lets you set the plan without knowing the plan
    before you run the tests.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you call it without a test number, the tests will still fail if
    you don't get to the end of the test. This is useful if you don't want to
    specify a plan but the tests exit unexpectedly. For example, the following
    would <i>pass</i> with <span class="Li">&quot;no_plan&quot;</span> but fails
    with <span class="Li">&quot;all_done&quot;</span>.</p>

<p class="Pp">It used to be that this module would produce a warning when used
    with Moose:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    Prototype mismatch: sub main::blessed ($) vs none
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This was because Test::Deep exported a
    <span class="Li">&quot;blessed()&quot;</span> function by default, but its
    prototype did not match the Moose version's prototype. We now exclude the
    Test::Deep version by default. If you need it, you can call the
    fully-qualified version or request it on the command line:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use Test::Most 'blessed';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that as of version <span class="Li">0.34</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;reftype&quot;</span> is also excluded from
    <span class="Li">&quot;Test::Deep&quot;</span>'s import list. This was

<p class="Pp">Sometimes you don't want to exclude an entire test module, but
    just a particular symbol that is causing issues You can exclude the
    symbol(s) in the standard way, by specifying the symbol in the import list

<h2 class="Ss">Deferred plans</h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>DEPRECATED</b> and will be removed in some future release of
    this module. Using <span class="Li">&quot;defer_plan&quot;</span> will
    <span class="Li">&quot;carp()&quot;</span>. Use

<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> use Test::Most qw&lt;defer_plan&gt;;
 use My::Tests;
 my $test_count = My::Tests-&gt;run;
 all_done($test_count);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes it's difficult to know the plan up front, but you can
    calculate the plan as your tests run. As a result, you want to defer the
    plan until the end of the test. Typically, the best you can do is this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> use Test::More 'no_plan';
 use My::Tests;
 My::Tests-&gt;run;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But when you do that,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Test::Builder&quot;</span> merely asserts that the
    number of tests you <i>ran</i> is the number of tests. Until now, there was
    no way of asserting that the number of tests you <i>expected</i> is the
    number of tests unless you do so before any tests have run. This fixes that
    problem.</p>

</section>
<section class="Ss">

  ok&quot;</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">We do not bundle Test::use::ok, though it's been requested. That's
    because <span class="Li">&quot;use_ok&quot;</span> is broken, but
    Test::use::ok is also subtly broken (and a touch harder to fix). See
    &lt;http://use.perl.org/~Ovid/journal/39859&gt; for more information.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to test if you can use a module, just use it. If it

    over a local copy of the CPAN to find the most commonly used testing

<p class="Pp">The modules chosen seemed the best fit for what
    <span class="Li">&quot;Test::Most&quot;</span> is trying to do. As of 0.02,
    we've added Test::Warn by request. It's not in the top ten, but it's a great

<h2 class="Ss">Deferred plans</h2>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes you don't know the number of tests you will run when you
    use <span class="Li">&quot;Test::More&quot;</span>. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;plan()&quot;</span> function allows you to delay
    specifying the plan, but you must still call it before the tests are run.
    This is an error:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> use Test::More;
 my $tests = 0;
 foreach my $test (
     my $count = run($test); # assumes tests are being run
     $tests += $count;
 }
 plan($tests);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The way around this is typically to use 'no_plan' and when the
    tests are done, <span class="Li">&quot;Test::Builder&quot;</span> merely
    sets the plan to the number of tests run. We'd like for the programmer to
    specify this number instead of letting
    <span class="Li">&quot;Test::Builder&quot;</span> do it. However,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Test::Builder&quot;</span> internals are a bit
    difficult to work with, so we're delaying this feature.</p>

  <b>skip()</b></a></h2>
<pre> if ( $some_condition ) {
     skip $message, $num_tests;
 }
 else {
     # run those tests
 }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That would be cleaner and I might add it if enough people want
  it.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="permalink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Because of how Perl handles arguments, and because diagnostics are
    not really part of the Test Anything Protocol, what actually happens
    internally is that we note that a test has failed and we throw an exception
    or bail out as soon as the <i>next</i> test is called (but before it runs).
    This means that its arguments are automatically evaluated before we can take
    action:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> use Test::Most qw&lt;no_plan die&gt;;
 ok $foo, 'Die if this fails';
 ok factorial(123456),
   '... but wait a loooong time before you throw an exception';
</pre>
