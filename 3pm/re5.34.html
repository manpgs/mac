<p class="Pp">When <span class="Li">&quot;use re 'taint'&quot;</span> is in
    effect, and a tainted string is the target of a regexp, the regexp memories
    (or values returned by the m// operator in list context) are tainted. This
    feature is useful when regexp operations on tainted data aren't meant to
    extract safe substrings, but to perform other transformations.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="'eval'_mode"><a class="permalink" href="#'eval'_mode">'eval'
  mode</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When <span class="Li">&quot;use re 'eval'&quot;</span> is in
    effect, a regexp is allowed to contain <span class="Li">&quot;(?{ ...
    })&quot;</span> zero-width assertions and <span class="Li">&quot;(??{ ...
    })&quot;</span> postponed subexpressions that are derived from variable
    interpolation, rather than appearing literally within the regexp. That is
    normally disallowed, since it is a potential security risk. Note that this
    pragma is ignored when the regular expression is obtained from tainted data,
    i.e. evaluation is always disallowed with tainted regular expressions. See
    &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre and &quot;(??{ code })&quot; in
  perlre.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the purpose of this pragma, interpolation of precompiled
    regular expressions (i.e., the result of
    <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span>) is <i>not</i> considered variable
    interpolation. Thus:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    /foo${pat}bar/
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>is</i> allowed if <span class="Li">$pat</span> is a precompiled
    regular expression, even if <span class="Li">$pat</span> contains
    <span class="Li">&quot;(?{ ... })&quot;</span> assertions or
    <span class="Li">&quot;(??{ ... })&quot;</span> subexpressions.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="'strict'_mode"><a class="permalink" href="#'strict'_mode">'strict'
  mode</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Note that this is an experimental feature which may be changed or
    removed in a future Perl release.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <span class="Li">&quot;use re 'strict'&quot;</span> is in
    effect, stricter checks are applied than otherwise when compiling regular
    expressions patterns. These may cause more warnings to be raised than
    otherwise, and more things to be fatal instead of just warnings. The purpose
    of this is to find and report at compile time some things, which may be
    legal, but have a reasonable possibility of not being the programmer's
    actual intent. This automatically turns on the
    <span class="Li">&quot;regexp&quot;</span> warnings category (if not already
    on) within its scope.</p>
<p class="Pp">As an example of something that is caught under
    <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;strict'&quot;</span>, but not otherwise, is the
    pattern</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> qr/\xABC/
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;\x&quot;</span> construct without curly
    braces should be followed by exactly two hex digits; this one is followed by
    three. This currently evaluates as equivalent to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> qr/\x{AB}C/
</pre>
<p class="Pp">that is, the character whose code point value is
    <span class="Li">0xAB</span>, followed by the letter
    <span class="Li">&quot;C&quot;</span>. But since
    <span class="Li">&quot;C&quot;</span> is a hex digit, there is a reasonable
    chance that the intent was</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> qr/\x{ABC}/
</pre>
<p class="Pp">that is the single character at <span class="Li">0xABC</span>.
    Under <span class="Li">'strict'</span> it is an error to not follow
    <span class="Li">&quot;\x&quot;</span> with exactly two hex digits. When not
    under <span class="Li">'strict'</span> a warning is generated if there is
    only one hex digit, and no warning is raised if there are more than two.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is expected that what exactly <span class="Li">'strict'</span>
    does will evolve over time as we gain experience with it. This means that
    programs that compile under it in today's Perl may not compile, or may have
    more or fewer warnings, in future Perls. There is no backwards compatibility
    promises with regards to it. Also there are already proposals for an
    alternate syntax for enabling it. For these reasons, using it will raise a
    <span class="Li">&quot;experimental::re_strict&quot;</span> class warning,
    unless that category is turned off.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that if a pattern compiled within
    <span class="Li">'strict'</span> is recompiled, say by interpolating into
    another pattern, outside of <span class="Li">'strict'</span>, it is not
    checked again for strictness. This is because if it works under strict it
    must work under non-strict.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="'/flags'_mode"><a class="permalink" href="#'/flags'_mode">'/flags'
  mode</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When <span class="Li">&quot;use re
    '/</span><span class="Li"><i>flags</i></span><span class="Li">'&quot;</span>
    is specified, the given <i>flags</i> are automatically added to every
    regular expression till the end of the lexical scope. <i>flags</i> can be
    any combination of <span class="Li">'a'</span>,
    <span class="Li">'aa'</span>, <span class="Li">'d'</span>,
    <span class="Li">'i'</span>, <span class="Li">'l'</span>,
    <span class="Li">'m'</span>, <span class="Li">'n'</span>,
    <span class="Li">'p'</span>, <span class="Li">'s'</span>,
    <span class="Li">'u'</span>, <span class="Li">'x'</span>, and/or
    <span class="Li">'xx'</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;no re
    '/</span><span class="Li"><i>flags</i></span><span class="Li">'&quot;</span>
    will turn off the effect of <span class="Li">&quot;use re
    '/</span><span class="Li"><i>flags</i></span><span class="Li">'&quot;</span>
    for the given flags.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, if you want all your regular expressions to have
    /msxx on by default, simply put</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use re '/msxx';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">at the top of your code.</p>
<p class="Pp">The character set <span class="Li">&quot;/adul&quot;</span> flags
    cancel each other out. So, in this example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use re &quot;/u&quot;;
    &quot;ss&quot; =~ /\xdf/;
    use re &quot;/d&quot;;
    &quot;ss&quot; =~ /\xdf/;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">the second <span class="Li">&quot;use re&quot;</span> does an
    implicit <span class="Li">&quot;no re '/u'&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use re &quot;/xx&quot;;   # Doubled-x
    ...
    use re &quot;/x&quot;;    # Single x from here on
    ...
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Turning on one of the character set flags with
    <span class="Li">&quot;use re&quot;</span> takes precedence over the
    <span class="Li">&quot;locale&quot;</span> pragma and the 'unicode_strings'
    <span class="Li">&quot;feature&quot;</span>, for regular expressions.
    Turning off one of these flags when it is active reverts to the behaviour
    specified by whatever other pragmata are in scope. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use feature &quot;unicode_strings&quot;;
    no re &quot;/u&quot;; # does nothing
    use re &quot;/l&quot;;
    no re &quot;/l&quot;; # reverts to unicode_strings behaviour
</pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="'debug'_mode"><a class="permalink" href="#'debug'_mode">'debug'
  mode</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When <span class="Li">&quot;use re 'debug'&quot;</span> is in
    effect, perl emits debugging messages when compiling and using regular
    expressions. The output is the same as that obtained by running a
    <span class="Li">&quot;-DDEBUGGING&quot;</span>-enabled perl interpreter
    with the <b>-Dr</b> switch. It may be quite voluminous depending on the
    complexity of the match. Using
    <span class="Li">&quot;debugcolor&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;debug&quot;</span> enables a form of output that can
    be used to get a colorful display on terminals that understand termcap color
    sequences. Set <span class="Li">$ENV{PERL_RE_TC}</span> to a comma-separated
    list of <span class="Li">&quot;termcap&quot;</span> properties to use for
    highlighting strings on/off, pre-point part on/off. See &quot;Debugging
    Regular Expressions&quot; in perldebug for additional info.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of 5.9.5 the directive <span class="Li">&quot;use re
    'debug'&quot;</span> and its equivalents are lexically scoped, as the other
    directives are. However they have both compile-time and run-time
  effects.</p>

  <dd>When Perl encounters a wildcard subpattern, (see &quot;Wildcards in
      Property Values&quot; in perlunicode), it suspends compilation of the main
      pattern, compiles the subpattern, and then matches that against all legal
      possibilities to determine the actual code points the subpattern matches.
      After that it adds these to the main pattern, and continues its
      compilation.
    <p class="Pp">You may very well want to see how your subpattern gets
        compiled, but it is likely of less use to you to see how Perl matches
        that against all the legal possibilities, as that is under control of
        Perl, not you. Therefore, the debugging information of the compilation
        portion is as specified by the other options, but the debugging output
        of the matching portion is normally suppressed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can use the WILDCARD option to enable the debugging output
        of this subpattern matching. Careful! This can lead to voluminous
        outputs, and it may not make much sense to you what and why Perl is
        doing what it is. But it may be helpful to you to see why things aren't
        going the way you expect.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that this option alone doesn't cause any debugging
        information to be output. What it does is stop the normal suppression of
        execution-related debugging information during the matching portion of
        the compilation of wildcards. You also have to specify which execution
        debugging information you want, such as by also including the EXECUTE
        option.</p>

<p class="Pp">As of perl 5.9.5 're' debug contains a number of utility functions

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="is_regexp($ref)"><a class="permalink" href="#is_regexp($ref)">is_regexp($ref)</a></dt>
  <dd>Returns true if the argument is a compiled regular expression as returned
      by <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span>, false if it is not.
    <p class="Pp">This function will not be confused by overloading or blessing.

  <dd>If the argument is a compiled regular expression as returned by
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span>, then this function returns what
      the optimiser considers to be the longest anchored fixed string and
      longest floating fixed string in the pattern.
    <p class="Pp">A <i>fixed string</i> is defined as being a substring that
        must appear for the pattern to match. An <i>anchored fixed string</i> is
        a fixed string that must appear at a particular offset from the
        beginning of the match. A <i>floating</i> <i>fixed string</i> is defined
        as a fixed string that can appear at any point in a range of positions
        relative to the start of the match. For example,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $qr = qr/here .* there/x;
    my ($anchored, $floating) = regmust($qr);
    print &quot;anchored:'$anchored'\nfloating:'$floating'\n&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">results in</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    anchored:'here'
    floating:'there'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Because the <span class="Li">&quot;here&quot;</span> is before
        the <span class="Li">&quot;.*&quot;</span> in the pattern, its position
        can be determined exactly. That's not true, however, for the
        <span class="Li">&quot;there&quot;</span>; it could appear at any point
        after where the anchored string appeared. Perl uses both for its
        optimisations, preferring the longer, or, if they are equal, the
        floating.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE:</b> This may not necessarily be the definitive
        longest anchored and floating string. This will be what the optimiser of
        the Perl that you are using thinks is the longest. If you believe that
        the result is wrong please report it via the perlbug utility.</p>

  <dd>If the argument is a compiled regular expression as returned by
