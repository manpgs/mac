    Module::Install</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Though Module::Install itself has a general FAQ section in the
    pod, it's more for advocacy. Here's an incomplete and growing list of the
    actual questions I have been frequently asked (or found on the net) about
    Module::Install.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Do_I_also_have_to_update_my_"><a class="permalink" href="#Do_I_also_have_to_update_my_">Do
  I also have to update my CPAN modules every time Module::Install is
  updated?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The point of Module::Install is let module authors take care of
    everything related to updating toolchains for the sake of module users. So,
    if you choose to use Module::Install, it's you who should update toolchains,
    i.e. Module::Install and other bundled modules. You should check if there's
    any significant change/fix in your toolchains. You should check if your
    toolchains go along with other tools users use to install your
    distributions, or with the systems users are in, or whatever that matters.
    In the end, you are expected to have much more knowledge and willingness
    than average users.</p>
<p class="Pp">That being said, practically, you don't have to update your
    distributions if they are working well. But if you do find issues, please
    update your distributions, even when you have nothing to change in your own
    modules. Module::Install is not only a tool to write better, but also a tool
    to encourage you to help others.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Do_I_really_have_to_avoid_"><a class="permalink" href="#Do_I_really_have_to_avoid_">Do
  I really have to avoid <b>auto_install()</b>?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Not at all, <b>using </b><b>&quot;auto_install()&quot;</b><b> is
    just fine</b>. While it indeed behaved erratically in older Module::Install
    versions, there have been no reported issues since mid-2009. As far as
    compatibility with various CPAN clients: several rather large projects on
    CPAN (including Catalyst and DBIx::Class), are using
    <span class="Li">&quot;auto_install&quot;</span> without any issues reported
    by their substantial userbases.</p>
<p class="Pp">That said, if all you want to do is make it easy for a contributor
    to checkout your code and quickly install necessary dependencies, there are
    alternatives to <span class="Li">&quot;auto_install&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your CPAN module is new enough, you can pass a dot to the
    <b>cpan</b> command it provides, and it will install all the required
    distributions from the CPAN:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  $ cpan .
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The same is true for the <b>cpanm</b> command from App::cpanminus,
    with which you even can write like <span class="Li">&quot;cpanm
    --installdeps .&quot;</span></p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Should_I_put_an__inc__directory_Module::Install_automatically_creates_into_a_repository_for_my_projects?"><a class="permalink" href="#Should_I_put_an__inc__directory_Module::Install_automatically_creates_into_a_repository_for_my_projects?">Should
  I put an &quot;inc&quot; directory Module::Install automatically creates into
  a repository for my projects?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Depends. If the repository is private and only for you, you
    usually don't want to put it in your repository to let you always use the
    latest Module::Install you have (the <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span>
    directory is recreated each time you run <span class="Li">&quot;perl
    Makefile.PL&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">If not, but you alone are the release manager and know what you
    have to do when you release, putting the
    <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> directory into your repository may
    help other casual contributors, especially if you use minor (or private)
    non-core extensions in your Makefile.PL.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, if you generously allow other people to release, or
    you're not so familiar with how Module::Install works and don't know what
    you have to do in the above situation, <b>don't</b> put it in the
    repository. It may be the cause of troubles including a wrong version in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;META.yml&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you feel sorry about the inconvenience for your fellow
    contributors, you may want to add explicitly
    <span class="Li">&quot;use</span>
    <span class="Li">Module::Install::&lt;ExtensionYouWantToUse&gt;;&quot;</span>
    after <span class="Li">&quot;use</span>
    <span class="Li">inc::Module::Install;&quot;</span> in your Makefile.PL. It
    doesn't do any harm, and it makes clear which extensions they need to
    install.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What're_there_in_the__inc__directory?"><a class="permalink" href="#What're_there_in_the__inc__directory?">What're
  there in the &quot;inc&quot; directory?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Module::Install puts its components (sometimes with extra modules)
    under the <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> directory to be released
    with a distribution. Those modules will not be installed into your system,
    unless explicitly copied into somewhere. They are only used to help
    configuration, tests, and/or installation.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there's no <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> directory,
    Module::Install will automatically create it when you run
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot;</span>. And if that happens, a
    directory (as of this writing, <span class="Li">&quot;.author&quot;</span>)
    will also be created under the <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span>
    directory. If the <span class="Li">&quot;.author&quot;</span> directory
    exists, the <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> directory will be
    recreated each time you run <span class="Li">&quot;perl</span>
    <span class="Li">Makefile.PL&quot;</span> to make sure everything you need
    is included and up-to-date. This <span class="Li">&quot;.author&quot;</span>
    directory will not be included in a distribution.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_perl_Makefile.PL__doesn't_work_or_does_a_strange_behavior_for_me._Why?"><a class="permalink" href="#_perl_Makefile.PL__doesn't_work_or_does_a_strange_behavior_for_me._Why?">&quot;perl
  Makefile.PL&quot; doesn't work or does a strange behavior for me.
  Why?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Module::Install uses an Autoloader magic to delegate command
    handling to the extensions in the <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span>
    directory. This works while everything is in order, but when it finds
    something it can't understands, it dies with a compile error, or does what
    you don't expect.</p>
<p class="Pp">To prevent the latter strange behavior, Module::Install 0.96 and
    above dies when it tries to process unknown commands. In most cases (other
    than typos), these unknown commands are from non-core extensions on the
    CPAN, and they should hopefully have predictable names that you can easily
    tell from which extension they come, though some may be a bit hard to
  find.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are trying to contribute to some project, and having a
    trouble to run <span class="Li">&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</span>, please
    contact the author of the project to learn what you have to install. If the
    distribution is already on the CPAN, you may also want to look into the
    MANIFEST file to see which extensions are included in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> directory before you ask.</p>
<p class="Pp">This usually does not happen in the user land as distributions
    that use Module::Install should have all the necessary extensions under the
    <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> directory. If this should happen,
    that's most probably because the release manager shipped the distribution
    under a non-author mode. Please contact the author to fix the issue.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Why_can't_I_do__anything__with_Module::Install_that_I_can_do_with_ExtUtils::MakeMaker?"><a class="permalink" href="#Why_can't_I_do__anything__with_Module::Install_that_I_can_do_with_ExtUtils::MakeMaker?">Why
  can't I do &lt;anything&gt; with Module::Install that I can do with
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Module::Install is just a wrapper of ExtUtils::MakeMaker. You can
    do almost everything you can do with ExtUtils::MakeMaker by passing
    arbitrary attributes to ExtUtils::MakeMaker in the backend via
    <span class="Li">&quot;makemaker_args&quot;</span> like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  use inc::Module::Install;
  
  all_from 'lib/Foo/Bar.pm';
  
  makemaker_args(
    dist =&gt; { PREOP =&gt; '...' },
    PL_FILES =&gt; {'bin/foobar.PL' =&gt; 'bin/foobar'},
  );
  WriteAll;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, by the singleton nature of Module::Install, it may fail
    to process Makefile.PLs in subdirectories correctly now, and you may need to
    override attributes explicitly in some cases where Module::Install provides
    other default values than ExtUtils::MakeMaker does. Please see also the
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker's pod for further instructions.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="I_added_MyMakefile.PL_to_my_distribution,_but_it_doesn't_work_as_I_expected._Why?"><a class="permalink" href="#I_added_MyMakefile.PL_to_my_distribution,_but_it_doesn't_work_as_I_expected._Why?">I
  added MyMakefile.PL to my distribution, but it doesn't work as I expected.
  Why?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">ExtUtils::MakeMaker (and Module::Build also) treats
    <span class="Li">&quot;*.PL&quot;</span> files in the top level directory as
    something special to generate other files. So, if you add something that has
    <span class="Li">&quot;.PL&quot;</span> extension like
    <span class="Li">&quot;MyMakefile.PL&quot;</span> in the top level
    directory, it also runs automatically when you run Makefile.PL.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you don't like this behavior, use
    <span class="Li">&quot;makemaker_args&quot;</span> to pass an anonymous hash
    to <span class="Li">&quot;PL_FILES&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  makemaker_args(PL_FILES =&gt; {});
