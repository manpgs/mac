  Problem</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Source filtering is an immensely powerful feature of recent
    versions of Perl. It allows one to extend the language itself (e.g. the
    Switch module), to simplify the language (e.g. Language::Pythonesque), or to
    completely recast the language (e.g. Lingua::Romana::Perligata).
    Effectively, it allows one to use the full power of Perl as its own,
    recursively applied, macro language.</p>
<p class="Pp">The excellent Filter::Util::Call module (by Paul Marquess)
    provides a usable Perl interface to source filtering, but it is often too
    powerful and not nearly as simple as it could be.</p>
<p class="Pp">To use the module it is necessary to do the following:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Download, build, and install the Filter::Util::Call module. (If you have
      Perl 5.7.1 or later, this is already done for you.)</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Set up a module that does a <span class="Li">&quot;use
      Filter::Util::Call&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>Within that module, create an <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span>
      subroutine.</dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>Within the <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> subroutine do a call
      to <span class="Li">&quot;filter_add&quot;</span>, passing it either a
      subroutine reference.</dd>
  <dt>5.</dt>
  <dd>Within the subroutine reference, call
      <span class="Li">&quot;filter_read&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;filter_read_exact&quot;</span> to &quot;prime&quot;
      <span class="Li">$_</span> with source code data from the source file that
      will <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> your module. Check the status
      value returned to see if any source code was actually read in.</dd>
  <dt>6.</dt>
  <dd>Process the contents of <span class="Li">$_</span> to change the source
      code in the desired manner.</dd>
  <dt>7.</dt>
  <dd>Return the status value.</dd>
  <dt>8.</dt>
  <dd>If the act of unimporting your module (via a
      <span class="Li">&quot;no&quot;</span>) should cause source code filtering
      to cease, create an <span class="Li">&quot;unimport&quot;</span>
      subroutine, and have it call
      <span class="Li">&quot;filter_del&quot;</span>. Make sure that the call to
      <span class="Li">&quot;filter_read&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;filter_read_exact&quot;</span> in step 5 will not
      accidentally read past the <span class="Li">&quot;no&quot;</span>.
      Effectively this limits source code filters to line-by-line operation,
      unless the <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> subroutine does some
      fancy pre-pre-parsing of the source code it's filtering.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">For example, here is a minimal source code filter in a module
    named BANG.pm. It simply converts every occurrence of the sequence
    <span class="Li">&quot;BANG\s+BANG&quot;</span> to the sequence
    <span class="Li">&quot;die 'BANG' if $BANG&quot;</span> in any piece of code
    following a <span class="Li">&quot;use BANG;&quot;</span> statement (until
    the next <span class="Li">&quot;no BANG;&quot;</span> statement, if
  any):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    package BANG;

    use Filter::Util::Call ;

    sub import {
        filter_add( sub {
        my $caller = caller;
        my ($status, $no_seen, $data);
        while ($status = filter_read()) {
            if (/^\s*no\s+$caller\s*;\s*?$/) {
                $no_seen=1;
                last;
            }
            $data .= $_;
            $_ = &quot;&quot;;
        }
        $_ = $data;
        s/BANG\s+BANG/die 'BANG' if \$BANG/g
            unless $status &lt; 0;
        $_ .= &quot;no $class;\n&quot; if $no_seen;
        return 1;
        })
    }

    sub unimport {
        filter_del();
    }

    1 ;

  Solution</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Filter::Simple module provides a simplified interface to
    Filter::Util::Call; one that is sufficient for most common cases.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of the above process, with Filter::Simple the task of
    setting up a source code filter is reduced to:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Download and install the Filter::Simple module. (If you have Perl 5.7.1 or
      later, this is already done for you.)</dd>

  <dd>Set up a module that does a <span class="Li">&quot;use
      Filter::Simple&quot;</span> and then calls <span class="Li">&quot;FILTER {
      ... }&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>Within the anonymous subroutine or block that is passed to
      <span class="Li">&quot;FILTER&quot;</span>, process the contents of
      <span class="Li">$_</span> to change the source code in the desired
      manner.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In other words, the previous example, would become:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    package BANG;
    use Filter::Simple;

    FILTER {
        s/BANG\s+BANG/die 'BANG' if \$BANG/g;
    };

    1 ;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that the source code is passed as a single string, so any
    regex that uses <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> to detect line boundaries will need
    the <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> flag.</p>

<p class="Pp">By default, the installed filter only filters up to a line
    consisting of one of the three standard source &quot;terminators&quot;:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<p class="Pp">but this can be altered by passing a second argument to
    <span class="Li">&quot;use Filter::Simple&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;FILTER&quot;</span> (just remember: there's <i>no</i>
    comma after the initial block when you use
    <span class="Li">&quot;FILTER&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">That second argument may be either a
    <span class="Li">&quot;qr&quot;</span>'d regular expression (which is then
    used to match the terminator line), or a defined false value (which
    indicates that no terminator line should be looked for), or a reference to a
    hash (in which case the terminator is the value associated with the key
    <span class="Li">'terminator'</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, to cause the previous filter to filter only up to a
    line of the form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    GNAB esu;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">you would write:</p>

<p class="Pp">is useful because it allows other code (typically parser support

<p class="Pp">In those cases, it is easier to just append the filtering

<p class="Pp">One of the problems with a filter like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Filter::Simple;

    FILTER { s/BANG\s+BANG/die 'BANG' if \$BANG/g };

<p class="Pp">is that it indiscriminately applies the specified transformation

<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    warn 'BANG BANG, YOU'RE DEAD';
    BANG BANG;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will become:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    warn 'die 'BANG' if $BANG, YOU'RE DEAD';
    die 'BANG' if $BANG;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It is very common when filtering source to only want to apply the
    filter to the non-character-string parts of the code, or alternatively to
    <i>only</i> the character strings.</p>
<p class="Pp">Filter::Simple supports this type of filtering by automatically
    exporting the <span class="Li">&quot;FILTER_ONLY&quot;</span>
  subroutine.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;FILTER_ONLY&quot;</span> takes a sequence
    of specifiers that install separate (and possibly multiple) filters that act
    on only parts of the source code. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Filter::Simple;

    FILTER_ONLY
        code      =&gt; sub { s/BANG\s+BANG/die 'BANG' if \$BANG/g },
        quotelike =&gt; sub { s/BANG\s+BANG/CHITTY CHITTY/g };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;code&quot;</span> subroutine will only
    be used to filter parts of the source code that are not quotelikes, POD, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span>. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;quotelike&quot;</span> subroutine only filters Perl
    quotelikes (including here documents).</p>
<p class="Pp">The full list of alternatives is:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;code&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Filters only those sections of the source code that are not quotelikes,
      POD, or <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;code_no_comments&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Filters only those sections of the source code that are not quotelikes,
      POD, comments, or <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;executable&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Filters only those sections of the source code that are not POD or
      <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;executable_no_comments&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Filters only those sections of the source code that are not POD, comments,
      or <span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;quotelike&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Filters only Perl quotelikes (as interpreted by
      <span class="Li">&amp;Text::Balanced::extract_quotelike</span>).</dd>
  <dt>&quot;string&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Filters only the string literal parts of a Perl quotelike (i.e. the
      contents of a string literal, either half of a
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span>, the second half of an
      <span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span>).</dd>
  <dt>&quot;regex&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Filters only the pattern literal parts of a Perl quotelike (i.e. the
      contents of a <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span> or an
      <span class="Li">&quot;m//&quot;</span>, the first half of an
      <span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span>).</dd>
  <dt>&quot;all&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Filters everything. Identical in effect to
      <span class="Li">&quot;FILTER&quot;</span>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Except for <span class="Li">&quot;FILTER_ONLY code =&gt; sub
    {...}&quot;</span>, each of the component filters is called repeatedly, once
    for each component found in the source code.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that you can also apply two or more of the same type of
    filter in a single <span class="Li">&quot;FILTER_ONLY&quot;</span>. For
    example, here's a simple macro-preprocessor that is only applied within
    regexes, with a final debugging pass that prints the resulting source
  code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Regexp::Common;
    FILTER_ONLY
        regex =&gt; sub { s/!\[/[^/g },
        regex =&gt; sub { s/%d/$RE{num}{int}/g },

<h2 class="Ss" id="Filtering_only_the_code_parts_of_source_code"><a class="permalink" href="#Filtering_only_the_code_parts_of_source_code">Filtering
  only the code parts of source code</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Most source code ceases to be grammatically correct when it is
    broken up into the pieces between string literals and regexes. So the
    <span class="Li">'code'</span> and
    <span class="Li">'code_no_comments'</span> component filter behave slightly
    differently from the other partial filters described in the previous
    section.</p>
<p class="Pp">Rather than calling the specified processor on each individual
    piece of code (i.e. on the bits between quotelikes), the
    <span class="Li">'code...'</span> partial filters operate on the entire
    source code, but with the quotelike bits (and, in the case of
    <span class="Li">'code_no_comments'</span>, the comments) &quot;blanked
    out&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">That is, a <span class="Li">'code...'</span> filter
    <i>replaces</i> each quoted string, quotelike, regex, POD, and __DATA__
    section with a placeholder. The delimiters of this placeholder are the
    contents of the <span class="Li">$;</span> variable at the time the filter
    is applied (normally <span class="Li">&quot;\034&quot;</span>). The
    remaining four bytes are a unique identifier for the component being
    replaced.</p>
<p class="Pp">This approach makes it comparatively easy to write code
    preprocessors without worrying about the form or contents of strings,
    regexes, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">For convenience, during a <span class="Li">'code...'</span>
    filtering operation, Filter::Simple provides a package variable
    (<span class="Li">$Filter::Simple::placeholder</span>) that contains a
    pre-compiled regex that matches any placeholder...and captures the
    identifier within the placeholder. Placeholders can be moved and re-ordered
    within the source code as needed.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, a second package variable
    (<span class="Li">@Filter::Simple::components</span>) contains a list of the
    various pieces of <span class="Li">$_</span>, as they were originally split
    up to allow placeholders to be inserted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once the filtering has been applied, the original strings,
    regexes, POD, etc. are re-inserted into the code, by replacing each
    placeholder with the corresponding original component (from
    <span class="Li">@components</span>). Note that this means that the
    <span class="Li">@components</span> variable must be treated with extreme
    care within the filter. The <span class="Li">@components</span> array stores
    the &quot;back- translations&quot; of each placeholder inserted into
    <span class="Li">$_</span>, as well as the interstitial source code between
    placeholders. If the placeholder backtranslations are altered in
    <span class="Li">@components</span>, they will be similarly changed when the
    placeholders are removed from <span class="Li">$_</span> after the filter is
    complete.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the following filter detects concatenated pairs of
    strings/quotelikes and reverses the order in which they are
  concatenated:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    package DemoRevCat;
    use Filter::Simple;

    FILTER_ONLY code =&gt; sub {
        my $ph = $Filter::Simple::placeholder;
        s{ ($ph) \s* [.] \s* ($ph) }{ $2.$1 }gx
    };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Thus, the following code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use DemoRevCat;

    my $str = &quot;abc&quot; . q(def);

    print &quot;$str\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">would become:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    my $str = q(def).&quot;abc&quot;;

    print &quot;$str\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and hence print:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    defabc

    subroutines -- <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;unimport&quot;</span> -- which take care of all the
    nasty details.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, the generated
    <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> subroutine passes its own
    argument list to the filtering subroutine, so the BANG.pm filter could
    easily be made parametric:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    package BANG;

    use Filter::Simple;

    FILTER {
        my ($die_msg, $var_name) = @_;
        s/BANG\s+BANG/die '$die_msg' if \${$var_name}/g;
    };

    # and in some user code:

    use BANG &quot;BOOM&quot;, &quot;BAM&quot;;  # &quot;BANG BANG&quot; becomes: die 'BOOM' if $BAM
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The specified filtering subroutine is called every time a
    <span class="Li">&quot;use BANG&quot;</span> is encountered, and passed all
    the source code following that call, up to either the next
    <span class="Li">&quot;no BANG;&quot;</span> (or whatever terminator you've
    set) or the end of the source file, whichever occurs first. By default, any
    <span class="Li">&quot;no</span> <span class="Li">BANG;&quot;</span> call
    must appear by itself on a separate line, or it is ignored.</p>
