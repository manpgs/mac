<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Symbol::gensym&quot;</span> creates an
    anonymous glob and returns a reference to it. Such a glob reference can be
    used as a file or directory handle.</p>
<p class="Pp">For backward compatibility with older implementations that didn't
    support anonymous globs,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Symbol::ungensym&quot;</span> is also provided. But
    it doesn't do anything.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Symbol::geniosym&quot;</span> creates an
    anonymous IO handle. This can be assigned into an existing glob without
    affecting the non-IO portions of the glob.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Symbol::qualify&quot;</span> turns
    unqualified symbol names into qualified variable names (e.g.
    &quot;myvar&quot; -&gt; &quot;MyPackage::myvar&quot;). If it is given a
    second parameter, <span class="Li">&quot;qualify&quot;</span> uses it as the
    default package; otherwise, it uses the package of its caller. Regardless,
    global variable names (e.g. &quot;STDOUT&quot;, &quot;ENV&quot;,
    &quot;SIG&quot;) are always qualified with &quot;main::&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Qualification applies only to symbol names (strings). References
    are left unchanged under the assumption that they are glob references, which
    are qualified by their nature.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Symbol::qualify_to_ref&quot;</span> is just
    like <span class="Li">&quot;Symbol::qualify&quot;</span> except that it
    returns a glob ref rather than a symbol name, so you can use the result even
    if <span class="Li">&quot;use strict 'refs'&quot;</span> is in effect.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Symbol::delete_package&quot;</span> wipes
    out a whole package namespace. Note this routine is not exported by
    default--you may want to import it explicitly.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Symbol::delete_package&quot;</span> is a
    bit too powerful. It undefines every symbol that lives in the specified
    package. Since perl, for performance reasons, does not perform a symbol
    table lookup each time a function is called or a global variable is
    accessed, some code that has already been loaded and that makes use of
    symbols in package <span class="Li">&quot;Foo&quot;</span> may stop working
    after you delete <span class="Li">&quot;Foo&quot;</span>, even if you reload
    the <span class="Li">&quot;Foo&quot;</span> module afterwards.</p>
