<p class="Pp">This module contains methods to test the reachability of remote
    hosts on a network. A ping object is first created with optional parameters,
    a variable number of hosts may be pinged multiple times and then the
    connection is closed.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may choose one of six different protocols to use for the ping.
    The &quot;tcp&quot; protocol is the default. Note that a live remote host
    may still fail to be pingable by one or more of these protocols. For
    example, www.microsoft.com is generally alive but not &quot;icmp&quot;
    pingable.</p>
<p class="Pp">With the &quot;tcp&quot; protocol the <b>ping()</b> method
    attempts to establish a connection to the remote host's echo port. If the
    connection is successfully established, the remote host is considered
    reachable. No data is actually echoed. This protocol does not require any
    special privileges but has higher overhead than the &quot;udp&quot; and
    &quot;icmp&quot; protocols.</p>
<p class="Pp">Specifying the &quot;udp&quot; protocol causes the <b>ping()</b>
    method to send a udp packet to the remote host's echo port. If the echoed
    packet is received from the remote host and the received packet contains the
    same data as the packet that was sent, the remote host is considered
    reachable. This protocol does not require any special privileges. It should
    be borne in mind that, for a udp ping, a host will be reported as
    unreachable if it is not running the appropriate echo service. For Unix-like
    systems see <b>inetd</b>(8) for more information.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the &quot;icmp&quot; protocol is specified, the <b>ping()</b>
    method sends an icmp echo message to the remote host, which is what the UNIX
    ping program does. If the echoed message is received from the remote host
    and the echoed information is correct, the remote host is considered
    reachable. Specifying the &quot;icmp&quot; protocol requires that the
    program be run as root or that the program be setuid to root.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the &quot;external&quot; protocol is specified, the
    <b>ping()</b> method attempts to use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Ping::External&quot;</span> module to ping the
    remote host. <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Ping::External&quot;</span>
    interfaces with your system's default
    <span class="Li">&quot;ping&quot;</span> utility to perform the ping, and
    generally produces relatively accurate results. If
    <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Ping::External&quot;</span> if not installed on
    your system, specifying the &quot;external&quot; protocol will result in an
    error.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the &quot;syn&quot; protocol is specified, the &quot;ping&quot;
    method will only send a TCP SYN packet to the remote host then immediately
    return. If the syn packet was sent successfully, it will return a true
    value, otherwise it will return false. NOTE: Unlike the other protocols, the
    return value does NOT determine if the remote host is alive or not since the
    full TCP three-way handshake may not have completed yet. The remote host is
    only considered reachable if it receives a TCP ACK within the timeout
    specified. To begin waiting for the ACK packets, use the &quot;ack&quot;
    method as explained below. Use the &quot;syn&quot; protocol instead the
    &quot;tcp&quot; protocol to determine reachability of multiple destinations
    simultaneously by sending parallel TCP SYN packets. It will not block while
    testing each remote host. This protocol does not require any special
    privileges.</p>

    IPV6_RECVPATHMTU])</a></dt>
  <dd>Create a new ping object. All of the parameters are optional and can be
      passed as hash ref. All options besides the first 7 must be passed as hash
      ref.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;proto&quot;</span> specifies the
        protocol to use when doing a ping. The current choices are
        &quot;tcp&quot;, &quot;udp&quot;, &quot;icmp&quot;, &quot;icmpv6&quot;,
        &quot;stream&quot;, &quot;syn&quot;, or &quot;external&quot;. The
        default is &quot;tcp&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a <span class="Li">&quot;timeout&quot;</span> in seconds is
        provided, it is used when a timeout is not given to the <b>ping()</b>
        method (below). The timeout must be greater than 0 and the default, if
        not specified, is 5 seconds.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the number of data bytes
        (<span class="Li">&quot;bytes&quot;</span>) is given, that many data
        bytes are included in the ping packet sent to the remote host. The
        number of data bytes is ignored if the protocol is &quot;tcp&quot;. The
        minimum (and default) number of data bytes is 1 if the protocol is
        &quot;udp&quot; and 0 otherwise. The maximum number of data bytes that
        can be specified is 65535, but staying below the MTU (1472 bytes for
        ICMP) is recommended. Many small devices cannot deal with fragmented
        ICMP packets.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;device&quot;</span> is given, this
        device is used to bind the source endpoint before sending the ping
        packet. I believe this only works with superuser privileges and with udp
        and icmp protocols at this time.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If &lt;tos&gt; is given, this ToS is configured into the
        socket.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For icmp, <span class="Li">&quot;ttl&quot;</span> can be
        specified to set the TTL of the outgoing packet.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Valid <span class="Li">&quot;family&quot;</span> values for
        IPv4:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   4, v4, ip4, ipv4, AF_INET (constant)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Valid <span class="Li">&quot;family&quot;</span> values for
        IPv6:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   6, v6, ip6, ipv6, AF_INET6 (constant)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;host&quot;</span> argument
        implicitly specifies the family if the family argument is not given.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;port&quot;</span> argument is only
        valid for a udp, tcp or stream ping, and will not do what you think it
        does. ping returns true when we get a &quot;Connection refused&quot;!
        The default is the echo port.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;bind&quot;</span> argument
        specifies the local_addr to bind to. By specifying a bind argument you
        don't need the bind method.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;gateway&quot;</span> argument is
        only valid for IPv6, and requires a IPv6 address.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;retrans&quot;</span> argument the
        exponential backoff rate, default 1.2. It matches the
        <span class="Li">$def_factor</span> global.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;dontfrag&quot;</span> argument sets
        the IP_DONTFRAG bit, but note that IP_DONTFRAG is not yet defined by
        Socket, and not available on many systems. Then it is ignored. On linux
        it also sets IP_MTU_DISCOVER to IP_PMTUDISC_DO but need we don't chunk
        oversized packets. You need to set <span class="Li">$data_size</span>
        manually.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$p-&gt;ping($host [, $timeout [, $family]]);</dt>
  <dd>Ping the remote host and wait for a response.
      <span class="Li">$host</span> can be either the hostname or the IP number
      of the remote host. The optional timeout must be greater than 0 seconds
      and defaults to whatever was specified when the ping object was created.
      Returns a success flag. If the hostname cannot be found or there is a
      problem with the IP number, the success flag returned will be undef.
      Otherwise, the success flag will be 1 if the host is reachable and 0 if it
      is not. For most practical purposes, undef and 0 and can be treated as the
      same case. In array context, the elapsed time as well as the string form
      of the ip the host resolved to are also returned. The elapsed time value
      will be a float, as returned by the <b>Time::HiRes::time()</b> function,
      if <b>hires()</b> has been previously called, otherwise it is returned as
      an integer.</dd>
  <dt>$p-&gt;source_verify( { 0 | 1 } );</dt>
  <dd>Allows source endpoint verification to be enabled or disabled. This is
      useful for those remote destinations with multiples interfaces where the
      response may not originate from the same endpoint that the original
      destination endpoint was sent to. This only affects udp and icmp protocol
      pings.
    <p class="Pp">This is enabled by default.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$p-&gt;service_check( { 0 | 1 } );</dt>
  <dd>Set whether or not the connect behavior should enforce remote service
      availability as well as reachability. Normally, if the remote server
      reported ECONNREFUSED, it must have been reachable because of the status
      packet that it reported. With this option enabled, the full three-way tcp
      handshake must have been established successfully before it will claim it
      is reachable. NOTE: It still does nothing more than connect and
      disconnect. It does not speak any protocol (i.e., HTTP or FTP) to ensure
      the remote server is sane in any way. The remote server CPU could be
      grinding to a halt and unresponsive to any clients connecting, but if the
      kernel throws the ACK packet, it is considered alive anyway. To really
      determine if the server is responding well would be application specific
      and is beyond the scope of Net::Ping. For udp protocol, enabling this
      option demands that the remote server replies with the same udp data that
      it was sent as defined by the udp echo service.
    <p class="Pp">This affects the &quot;udp&quot;, &quot;tcp&quot;, and
        &quot;syn&quot; protocols.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is disabled by default.</p>

    <p class="Pp">Not yet implemented.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$p-&gt;bind($local_addr);</dt>
  <dd>Sets the source address from which pings will be sent. This must be the
      address of one of the interfaces on the local host.
      <span class="Li">$local_addr</span> may be specified as a hostname or as a
      text IP address such as &quot;192.168.1.1&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">If the protocol is set to &quot;tcp&quot;, this method may be
        called any number of times, and each call to the <b>ping()</b> method
        (below) will use the most recent <span class="Li">$local_addr</span>. If
        the protocol is &quot;icmp&quot; or &quot;udp&quot;, then <b>bind()</b>
        must be called at most once per object, and (if it is called at all)
        must be called before the first call to <b>ping()</b> for that
      object.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <b>bind()</b> call can be omitted when specifying the
        <span class="Li">&quot;bind&quot;</span> option to <b>new()</b>.</p>

  <dt>$p-&gt;message_type([$ping_type]);</dt>
  <dd>When you are using the &quot;icmp&quot; protocol, this call permit to
      change the message type to 'echo' or 'timestamp' (only for IPv4, see RFC
      792).
    <p class="Pp">Without argument, it returns the currently used icmp protocol
        message type. By default, it returns 'echo'.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$p-&gt;open($host);</dt>
  <dd>When you are using the &quot;stream&quot; protocol, this call pre-opens
      the tcp socket. It's only necessary to do this if you want to provide a
      different timeout when creating the connection, or remove the overhead of
      establishing the connection from the first ping. If you don't call
      <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span>, the connection is
      automatically opened the first time
      <span class="Li">&quot;ping()&quot;</span> is called. This call simply
      does nothing if you are using any protocol other than stream.
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$host</span> argument can be omitted when

        <b>new()</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$p-&gt;ack( [ $host ] );</dt>
  <dd>When using the &quot;syn&quot; protocol, use this method to determine the
      reachability of the remote host. This method is meant to be called up to
      as many times as <b>ping()</b> was called. Each call returns the host (as
      passed to <b>ping()</b>) that came back with the TCP ACK. The order in
      which the hosts are returned may not necessarily be the same order in
      which they were SYN queued using the <b>ping()</b> method. If the timeout
      is reached before the TCP ACK is received, or if the remote host is not
      listening on the port attempted, then the TCP connection will not be
      established and <b>ack()</b> will return undef. In list context, the host,
      the ack time, the dotted ip string, and the port number will be returned
      instead of just the host. If the optional <span class="Li">$host</span>
      argument is specified, the return value will be pertaining to that host
      only. This call simply does nothing if you are using any protocol other
      than &quot;syn&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">When &quot;new&quot; had a host option, this host will be

<p class="Pp">There will be less network overhead (and some efficiency in your
    program) if you specify either the udp or the icmp protocol. The tcp
    protocol will generate 2.5 times or more traffic for each ping than either
    udp or icmp. If many hosts are pinged frequently, you may wish to implement
    a small wait (e.g. 25ms or more) between each ping to avoid flooding your
    network with packets.</p>
<p class="Pp">The icmp and icmpv6 protocols requires that the program be run as
    root or that it be setuid to root. The other protocols do not require
    special privileges, but not all network devices implement tcp or udp
  echo.</p>
<p class="Pp">Local hosts should normally respond to pings within milliseconds.
    However, on a very congested network it may take up to 3 seconds or longer
    to receive an echo packet from the remote host. If the timeout is set too
    low under these conditions, it will appear that the remote host is not
    reachable (which is almost the truth).</p>
<p class="Pp">Reachability doesn't necessarily mean that the remote host is
    actually functioning beyond its ability to echo packets. tcp is slightly
    better at indicating the health of a system than icmp because it uses more
    of the networking stack to respond.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because of a lack of anything better, this module uses its own
    routines to pack and unpack ICMP packets. It would be better for a separate
    module to be written which understands all of the different kinds of ICMP
    packets.</p>
