<p class="Pp">Finding the home country of a client using only the IP address can
    be difficult. Looking up the domain name associated with that address can
    provide some help, but many IP address are not reverse mapped to any useful
    domain, and the most common domain (.com) offers no help when looking for
    country.</p>
<p class="Pp">This module comes bundled with a database of countries where
    various IP addresses have been assigned. Although the country of assignment
    will probably be the country associated with a large ISP rather than the
    client herself, this is probably good enough for most log analysis
    applications, and under test has proved to be as accurate as reverse-DNS and
    WHOIS lookup.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$cc = $reg-&gt;inet_atocc(HOSTNAME)</dt>
  <dd>Takes a string giving the name of a host, and translates that to an
      two-letter country code. Takes arguments of both the 'rtfm.mit.edu' type
      and '18.181.0.24'. If the host name cannot be resolved, returns undef. If
      the resolved IP address is not contained within the database, returns
      undef. For multi-homed hosts (hosts with more than one address), the first
      address found is returned. For private Internet addresses (see RFC1918),
      returns two asterisks '**'.</dd>
  <dt>$cc = $reg-&gt;inet_ntocc(IP_ADDRESS)</dt>
  <dd>Takes a string (an opaque string as returned by
      <b>Socket::inet_aton()</b>) and translates it into a two-letter country
      code. If the IP address is not contained within the database, returns
      undef.</dd>
  <dt>$cc = $reg-&gt;<b>db_time()</b></dt>
  <dd>Returns the creation date of the database, measured as number of seconds
      since the Unix epoch (00:00:00 GMT, January 1, 1970). Suitable for feeding
      to &quot;gmtime&quot; and &quot;localtime&quot;. When used with
      IP::Country::Medium or Slow objects, returns zero.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PERFORMANCE"><a class="permalink" href="#PERFORMANCE">PERFORMANCE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">With a random selection of 65,000 IP addresses, the module can
    look up over 15,000 IP addresses per second on a 730MHz PIII (Coppermine)
    and over 25,000 IP addresses per second on a 1.3GHz Athlon. Out of this
    random selection of IP addresses, 43% had an associated country code. Please
    let me know if you've run this against a set of 'real' IP addresses from
    your log files, and have details of the proportion of IPs that had
    associated country codes.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="IP::Country::Slow_warning"><a class="permalink" href="#IP::Country::Slow_warning">IP::Country::Slow
  warning</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">During tests of this module, it was found that there was no
    measurable advantage in using this module in preference to
    IP::Country::Medium or IP::Country::Fast. You should use IP::Country::Medium
    is the majority of your lookups are of the form 'rtfm.mit.edu' (domain
    names), and IP::Country::Fast if the majority of your lookups are of the
    form '18.181.0.24' (IP addresses).</p>
<p class="Pp">IP::Country::Medium caches domain-name lookups, whereas
    IP::Country::Fast does not.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is *very* rare for a domain-name lookup to differ from the
    database used by IP::Country::Fast. Thus, there is no good reason to prefer
    a slow domain-name lookup to a fast database lookup. Nor is there any
    significant difference in coverage between the domain-name system and
    database. If you can find a real reason to use IP::Country::Slow, let me
    know.</p>

<p class="Pp">You'll probably want some kind of country code -&gt; country name
    conversion utility: you should use Geography::Countries from CPAN.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, you should note the circumstances where the country code
    returned by IP::Country will deviate from those used by
    Geography::Countries:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  AP - non-specific Asia-Pacific location
  CS - Czechoslovakia (former)
  EU - non-specific European Union location
  FX - France, Metropolitan
  PS - Palestinian Territory, Occupied

<p class="Pp">IP::Country::Fast - recommended for lookups of hostnames which are
    mostly in the dotted-quad form ('213.45.67.89').</p>
<p class="Pp">IP::Country::Medium - recommended for lookups of hostnames which
    are mostly in the domain-name form ('www.yahoo.com'). Caches domain-name
    lookups.</p>
<p class="Pp">IP::Country::Slow - NOT RECOMMENDED. Only included for
    completeness. Prefers domain-name lookups to database lookups, which is an
    expensive strategy of no benefit.</p>

    measurably faster than these native Perl modules. Paid subscription required
