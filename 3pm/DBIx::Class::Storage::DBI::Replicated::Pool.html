<h1 class="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="permalink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This class is used internally by
    DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated. You shouldn't need to create
    instances of this class.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In a replicated storage type, there is at least one replicant to
    handle the read-only traffic. The Pool class manages this replicant, or list
    of replicants, and gives some methods for querying information about their
    status.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ATTRIBUTES"><a class="permalink" href="#ATTRIBUTES">ATTRIBUTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This class defines the following attributes.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="maximum_lag_($num)"><a class="permalink" href="#maximum_lag_($num)">maximum_lag
  ($num)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This is a number which defines the maximum allowed lag returned by
    the &quot;lag_behind_master&quot; in DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI method. The
    default is 0. In general, this should return a larger number when the
    replicant is lagging behind its master, however the implementation of this
    is database specific, so don't count on this number having a fixed meaning.
    For example, MySQL will return a number of seconds that the replicating
    database is lagging.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="last_validated"><a class="permalink" href="#last_validated">last_validated</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This is an integer representing a time since the last time the
    replicants were validated. It's nothing fancy, just an integer provided via
    the perl time built-in.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="replicant_type_($classname)"><a class="permalink" href="#replicant_type_($classname)">replicant_type
  ($classname)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Base class used to instantiate replicants that are in the pool.
    Unless you need to subclass DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Replicant
    you should just leave this alone.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="replicants"><a class="permalink" href="#replicants">replicants</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A hashref of replicant, with the key being the dsn and the value
    returning the actual replicant storage. For example, if the
    <span class="Li">$dsn</span> element is something like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  &quot;dbi:SQLite:dbname=dbfile&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You could access the specific replicant via:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $schema-&gt;storage-&gt;replicants-&gt;{'dbname=dbfile'}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This attributes also supports the following helper methods:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="set_replicant($key=_$storage)"><a class="permalink" href="#set_replicant($key=_$storage)">set_replicant($key=&gt;$storage)</a></dt>
  <dd>Pushes a replicant onto the HashRef under
    <span class="Li">$key</span></dd>
  <dt id="get_replicant($key)"><a class="permalink" href="#get_replicant($key)">get_replicant($key)</a></dt>
  <dd>Retrieves the named replicant</dd>
  <dt id="has_replicants"><a class="permalink" href="#has_replicants">has_replicants</a></dt>
  <dd>Returns true if the Pool defines replicants.</dd>
  <dt id="num_replicants"><a class="permalink" href="#num_replicants">num_replicants</a></dt>
  <dd>The number of replicants in the pool</dd>
  <dt id="delete_replicant"><a class="permalink" href="#delete_replicant">delete_replicant
    ($key)</a></dt>
  <dd>Removes the replicant under <span class="Li">$key</span> from the
    pool</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="master"><a class="permalink" href="#master">master</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Reference to the master Storage.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="METHODS"><a class="permalink" href="#METHODS">METHODS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This class defines the following methods.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="connect_replicants_($schema,_Array_$connect_info_)"><a class="permalink" href="#connect_replicants_($schema,_Array_$connect_info_)">connect_replicants
  ($schema, Array[$connect_info])</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Given an array of <span class="Li">$dsn</span> or connect_info
    structures suitable for connected to a database, create an
    DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI::Replicated::Replicant object and store it in the
    &quot;replicants&quot; attribute.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="connect_replicant_($schema,_$connect_info)"><a class="permalink" href="#connect_replicant_($schema,_$connect_info)">connect_replicant
  ($schema, $connect_info)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Given a schema object and a hashref of
    <span class="Li">$connect_info</span>, connect the replicant and return
  it.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_safely_ensure_connected_($replicant)"><a class="permalink" href="#_safely_ensure_connected_($replicant)">_safely_ensure_connected
  ($replicant)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The standard ensure_connected method with throw an exception
    should it fail to connect. For the master database this is desirable, but
    since replicants are allowed to fail, this behavior is not desirable. This
    method wraps the call to ensure_connected in an eval in order to catch any
    generated errors. That way a slave can go completely offline (e.g. the box
    itself can die) without bringing down your entire pool of databases.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_safely_($replicant,_$name,_$code)"><a class="permalink" href="#_safely_($replicant,_$name,_$code)">_safely
  ($replicant, $name, $code)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Execute <span class="Li">$code</span> for operation
    <span class="Li">$name</span> catching any exceptions and printing an error
    message to the
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;$replicant-&quot;</span>debugobj&gt;&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Returns 1 on success and undef on failure.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="connected_replicants"><a class="permalink" href="#connected_replicants">connected_replicants</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Returns true if there are connected replicants. Actually is
    overloaded to return the number of replicants. So you can do stuff like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  if( my $num_connected = $storage-&gt;has_connected_replicants ) {
    print &quot;I have $num_connected connected replicants&quot;;
  } else {
    print &quot;Sorry, no replicants.&quot;;
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This method will actually test that each replicant in the
    &quot;replicants&quot; hashref is actually connected, try not to hit this 10
    times a second.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="active_replicants"><a class="permalink" href="#active_replicants">active_replicants</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This is an array of replicants that are considered to be active in
    the pool. This does not check to see if they are connected, but if they are
    not, DBIC should automatically reconnect them for us when we hit them with a
    query.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="all_replicants"><a class="permalink" href="#all_replicants">all_replicants</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Just a simple array of all the replicant storages. No particular
    order to the array is given, nor should any meaning be derived.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="validate_replicants"><a class="permalink" href="#validate_replicants">validate_replicants</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This does a check to see if 1) each replicate is connected (or
    reconnectable), 2) that is -&gt;is_replicating, and 3) that it is not
    exceeding the lag amount defined by &quot;maximum_lag&quot;. Replicants that
    fail any of these tests are set to inactive, and thus removed from the
    replication pool.</p>
<p class="Pp">This tests &quot;all_replicants&quot;, since a replicant that has
    been previous marked as inactive can be reactivated should it start to pass
    the validation tests again.</p>
<p class="Pp">See DBIx::Class::Storage::DBI for more about checking if a
    replicating connection is not following a master or is lagging.</p>
<p class="Pp">Calling this method will generate queries on the replicant
    databases so it is not recommended that you run them very often.</p>
<p class="Pp">This method requires that your underlying storage engine supports
    some sort of native replication mechanism. Currently only MySQL native
    replication is supported. Your patches to make other replication types work
    are welcomed.</p>
