<p class="Pp">JSON::PP is a pure perl JSON decoder/encoder, and (almost)
    compatible to much faster JSON::XS written by Marc Lehmann in C. JSON::PP
    works as a fallback module when you use JSON module without having installed
    JSON::XS.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because of this fallback feature of JSON.pm, JSON::PP tries not to
    be more JavaScript-friendly than JSON::XS (i.e. not to escape extra
    characters such as U+2028 and U+2029, etc), in order for you not to lose
    such JavaScript-friendliness silently when you use JSON.pm and install
    JSON::XS for speed or by accident. If you need JavaScript-friendly
    RFC7159-compliant pure perl module, try JSON::Tiny, which is derived from
    Mojolicious web framework and is also smaller and faster than JSON::PP.</p>
<p class="Pp">JSON::PP has been in the Perl core since Perl 5.14, mainly for
    CPAN toolchain modules to parse META.json.</p>

    UTF-8-encoded string. Please note that UTF-8-encoded strings do not contain
    any characters outside the range <span class="Li">0..255</span>, they are
    thus useful for bytewise/binary I/O. In future versions, enabling this
    option might enable autodetection of the UTF-16 and UTF-32 encoding
    families, as described in RFC4627.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">$enable</span> is false, then the

    string as a (non-encoded) Unicode string, while
    <span class="Li">&quot;decode&quot;</span> expects thus a Unicode string.
    Any decoding or encoding (e.g. to UTF-8 or UTF-16) needs to be done
    yourself, e.g. using the Encode module.</p>

<p class="Pp">Works remotely similar to

    excellent targets to serialise Perl objects into, especially as single-key
    JSON objects are as close to the type-tagged value concept as JSON gets
    (it's basically an ID/VALUE tuple). Of course, JSON does not support this in
    any way, so you need to make sure your data never looks like a serialised
    Perl hash.</p>
<p class="Pp">Typical names for the single object key are

<p class="Pp">In some cases, there is the need for incremental parsing of JSON

    Perl data structure in memory at one time, it does allow you to parse a JSON
    stream incrementally. It does so by accumulating text until it has a full
    JSON object, which it then can decode. This process is similar to using
    <span class="Li">&quot;decode_prefix&quot;</span> to see if a full JSON
    object is available, but is much more efficient (and can be implemented with
    a minimum of method calls).</p>
<p class="Pp">JSON::PP will only attempt to parse the JSON text once it is sure
    it has enough text to get a decisive result, using a very simple but truly
    incremental parser. This means that it sometimes won't stop as early as the
    full parser, for example, it doesn't detect mismatched parentheses. The only
    thing it guarantees is that it starts decoding as soon as a syntactically
    valid JSON text has been seen. This means you need to set resource limits
    (e.g. <span class="Li">&quot;max_size&quot;</span>) to ensure the parser
    will stop parsing in the presence if syntax errors.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following methods implement this incremental parser.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="incr_parse"><a class="permalink" href="#incr_parse">incr_parse</a></h2>
<pre>    $json-&gt;incr_parse( [$string] ) # void context
    
    $obj_or_undef = $json-&gt;incr_parse( [$string] ) # scalar context
    
    @obj_or_empty = $json-&gt;incr_parse( [$string] ) # list context
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is the central parsing function. It can both append new text
    and extract objects from the stream accumulated so far (both of these
    functions are optional).</p>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">$string</span> is given, then this string is
    appended to the already existing JSON fragment stored in the
    <span class="Li">$json</span> object.</p>
<p class="Pp">After that, if the function is called in void context, it will
    simply return without doing anything further. This can be used to add more
    text in as many chunks as you want.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the method is called in scalar context, then it will try to
    extract exactly <i>one</i> JSON object. If that is successful, it will
    return this object, otherwise it will return
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>. If there is a parse error, this
    method will croak just as <span class="Li">&quot;decode&quot;</span> would
    do (one can then use <span class="Li">&quot;incr_skip&quot;</span> to skip
    the erroneous part). This is the most common way of using the method.</p>
<p class="Pp">And finally, in list context, it will try to extract as many
    objects from the stream as it can find and return them, or the empty list
    otherwise. For this to work, there must be no separators (other than
    whitespace) between the JSON objects or arrays, instead they must be
    concatenated back-to-back. If an error occurs, an exception will be raised
    as in the scalar context case. Note that in this case, any previously-parsed
    JSON texts will be lost.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example: Parse some JSON arrays/objects in a given string and
    return them.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my @objs = JSON::PP-&gt;new-&gt;incr_parse (&quot;[5][7][1,2]&quot;);
</pre>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="incr_text"><a class="permalink" href="#incr_text">incr_text</a></h2>
<pre>    $lvalue_string = $json-&gt;incr_text
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This method returns the currently stored JSON fragment as an
    lvalue, that is, you can manipulate it. This <i>only</i> works when a
    preceding call to <span class="Li">&quot;incr_parse&quot;</span> in
    <i>scalar context</i> successfully returned an object. Under all other
    circumstances you must not call this function (I mean it. although in simple
    tests it might actually work, it <i>will</i> fail under real world
    conditions). As a special exception, you can also call this method before
    having parsed anything.</p>
<p class="Pp">That means you can only use this function to look at or manipulate
    text before or after complete JSON objects, not while the parser is in the
    middle of parsing a JSON object.</p>
<p class="Pp">This function is useful in two cases: a) finding the trailing text
    after a JSON object or b) parsing multiple JSON objects separated by
    non-JSON text (such as commas).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="incr_skip"><a class="permalink" href="#incr_skip">incr_skip</a></h2>
<pre>    $json-&gt;incr_skip
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will reset the state of the incremental parser and will
    remove the parsed text from the input buffer so far. This is useful after
    <span class="Li">&quot;incr_parse&quot;</span> died, in which case the input
    buffer and incremental parser state is left unchanged, to skip the text
    parsed so far and to reset the parse state.</p>
<p class="Pp">The difference to <span class="Li">&quot;incr_reset&quot;</span>
    is that only text until the parse error occurred is removed.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="incr_reset"><a class="permalink" href="#incr_reset">incr_reset</a></h2>
<pre>    $json-&gt;incr_reset
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This completely resets the incremental parser, that is, after this
    call, it will be as if the parser had never parsed anything.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is useful if you want to repeatedly parse JSON objects and
    want to ignore any trailing data, which means you have to reset the parser
    after each successful decode.</p>

  <dt id="number"><a class="permalink" href="#number">number</a></dt>
  <dd>A JSON number becomes either an integer, numeric (floating point) or
      string scalar in perl, depending on its range and any fractional parts. On
      the Perl level, there is no difference between those as Perl handles all
      the conversion details, but an integer may take slightly less memory and
      might represent more values exactly than floating point numbers.
    <p class="Pp">If the number consists of digits only, JSON::PP will try to
        represent it as an integer value. If that fails, it will try to
        represent it as a numeric (floating point) value if that is possible
        without loss of precision. Otherwise it will preserve the number as a
        string value (in which case you lose roundtripping ability, as the JSON
        number will be re-encoded to a JSON string).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Numbers containing a fractional or exponential part will
        always be represented as numeric (floating point) values, possibly at a
        loss of precision (in which case you might lose perfect roundtripping
        ability, but the JSON number will still be re-encoded as a JSON
      number).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that precision is not accuracy - binary floating point
        values cannot represent most decimal fractions exactly, and when
        converting from and to floating point, JSON::PP only guarantees
        precision up to but not including the least significant bit.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When <span class="Li">&quot;allow_bignum&quot;</span> is

    <p class="Pp">You can force the type to be a JSON string by stringifying

   $x .= &quot;&quot;;    # another, more awkward way to stringify
   print $x;    # perl does it for you, too, quite often

    <pre>   my $x = &quot;3&quot;; # some variable containing a string
   $x += 0;     # numify it, ensuring it will be dumped as a number
   $x *= 1;     # same thing, the choice is yours.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can not currently force the type in other, less obscure,
        ways.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Since version 2.91_01, JSON::PP uses a different number
        detection logic that converts a scalar that is possible to turn into a
        number safely. The new logic is slightly faster, and tends to help
        people who use older perl or who want to encode complicated data
        structure. However, this may results in a different JSON text from the
        one JSON::XS encodes (and thus may break tests that compare entire JSON
        texts). If you do need the previous behavior for compatibility or for
        finer control, set PERL_JSON_PP_USE_B environmental variable to true
        before you <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> JSON::PP (or
        JSON.pm).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that numerical precision has the same meaning as under
        Perl (so binary to decimal conversion follows the same rules as in Perl,
        which can differ to other languages). Also, your perl interpreter might
        expose extensions to the floating point numbers of your platform, such
        as infinities or NaN's - these cannot be represented in JSON, and it is
        an error to pass those in.</p>
    <p class="Pp">JSON::PP (and JSON::XS) trusts what you pass to
        <span class="Li">&quot;encode&quot;</span> method (or
        <span class="Li">&quot;encode_json&quot;</span> function) is a clean,
        validated data structure with values that can be represented as valid
        JSON values only, because it's not from an external data source (as
        opposed to JSON texts you pass to
        <span class="Li">&quot;decode&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;decode_json&quot;</span>, which JSON::PP
        considers tainted and doesn't trust). As JSON::PP doesn't know exactly
        what you and consumers of your JSON texts want the unexpected values to
        be (you may want to convert them into null, or to stringify them with or
        without normalisation (string representation of infinities/NaN may vary
        depending on platforms), or to croak without conversion), you're advised
        to do what you and your consumers need before you encode, and also not
        to numify values that may start with values that look like a number
        (including infinities/NaN), without validating.</p>

<h2 class="Ss">OBJECT SERIALISATION</h2>
<p class="Pp">As JSON cannot directly represent Perl objects, you have to choose
    between a pure JSON representation (without the ability to deserialise the
    object automatically again), and a nonstandard extension to the JSON syntax,
    tagged values.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>SERIALISATION</i></p>
<p class="Pp">What happens when <span class="Li">&quot;JSON::PP&quot;</span>
    encounters a Perl object depends on the
    <span class="Li">&quot;allow_blessed&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;convert_blessed&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;allow_tags&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;allow_bignum&quot;</span> settings, which are used in
    this order:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1. &quot;allow_tags&quot; is enabled and the object has a
    &quot;FREEZE&quot; method.</dt>
  <dd>In this case, <span class="Li">&quot;JSON::PP&quot;</span> creates a
      tagged JSON value, using a nonstandard extension to the JSON syntax.
    <p class="Pp">This works by invoking the
        <span class="Li">&quot;FREEZE&quot;</span> method on the object, with
        the first argument being the object to serialise, and the second
        argument being the constant string
        <span class="Li">&quot;JSON&quot;</span> to distinguish it from other
        serialisers.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;FREEZE&quot;</span> method can
        return any number of values (i.e. zero or more). These values and the
        paclkage/classname of the object will then be encoded as a tagged JSON
        value in the following format:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   (&quot;classname&quot;)[FREEZE return values...]
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">e.g.:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   (&quot;URI&quot;)[&quot;http://www.google.com/&quot;]
   (&quot;MyDate&quot;)[2013,10,29]
   (&quot;ImageData::JPEG&quot;)[&quot;Z3...VlCg==&quot;]
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For example, the hypothetical
        <span class="Li">&quot;My::Object&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;FREEZE&quot;</span> method might use the objects
        <span class="Li">&quot;type&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;id&quot;</span> members to encode the object:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   sub My::Object::FREEZE {
      my ($self, $serialiser) = @_;
      ($self-&gt;{type}, $self-&gt;{id})

    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>2. &quot;convert_blessed&quot; is enabled and the object has a
    &quot;TO_JSON&quot; method.</dt>
  <dd>In this case, the <span class="Li">&quot;TO_JSON&quot;</span> method of
      the object is invoked in scalar context. It must return a single scalar
      that can be directly encoded into JSON. This scalar replaces the object in
      the JSON text.
    <p class="Pp">For example, the following
        <span class="Li">&quot;TO_JSON&quot;</span> method will convert all URI
        objects to JSON strings when serialised. The fact that these values
        originally were URI objects is lost.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   sub URI::TO_JSON {
      my ($uri) = @_;
      $uri-&gt;as_string
   }
    </pre>

  <dt>3. &quot;allow_bignum&quot; is enabled and the object is a
    &quot;Math::BigInt&quot; or &quot;Math::BigFloat&quot;.</dt>
  <dd>The object will be serialised as a JSON number value.</dd>
  <dt>4. &quot;allow_blessed&quot; is enabled.</dt>
  <dd>The object will be serialised as a JSON null value.</dd>
  <dt>5. none of the above</dt>
  <dd>If none of the settings are enabled or the respective methods are missing,
      <span class="Li">&quot;JSON::PP&quot;</span> throws an exception.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><i>DESERIALISATION</i></p>
<p class="Pp">For deserialisation there are only two cases to consider: either
    nonstandard tagging was used, in which case
    <span class="Li">&quot;allow_tags&quot;</span> decides, or objects cannot be
    automatically be deserialised, in which case you can use postprocessing or
    the <span class="Li">&quot;filter_json_object&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;filter_json_single_key_object&quot;</span> callbacks
    to get some real objects our of your JSON.</p>
<p class="Pp">This section only considers the tagged value case: a tagged JSON
    object is encountered during decoding and
    <span class="Li">&quot;allow_tags&quot;</span> is disabled, a parse error
    will result (as if tagged values were not part of the grammar).</p>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;allow_tags&quot;</span> is enabled,
    <span class="Li">&quot;JSON::PP&quot;</span> will look up the
    <span class="Li">&quot;THAW&quot;</span> method of the package/classname
    used during serialisation (it will not attempt to load the package as a Perl
    module). If there is no such method, the decoding will fail with an
  error.</p>
<p class="Pp">Otherwise, the <span class="Li">&quot;THAW&quot;</span> method is
    invoked with the classname as first argument, the constant string
    <span class="Li">&quot;JSON&quot;</span> as second argument, and all the
    values from the JSON array (the values originally returned by the
    <span class="Li">&quot;FREEZE&quot;</span> method) as remaining
  arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">The method must then return the object. While technically you can
    return any Perl scalar, you might have to enable the
    <span class="Li">&quot;allow_nonref&quot;</span> setting to make that work
    in all cases, so better return an actual blessed reference.</p>
<p class="Pp">As an example, let's implement a
    <span class="Li">&quot;THAW&quot;</span> function that regenerates the
    <span class="Li">&quot;My::Object&quot;</span> from the
    <span class="Li">&quot;FREEZE&quot;</span> example earlier:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>   sub My::Object::THAW {
      my ($class, $serialiser, $type, $id) = @_;

  FLAG NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This section is taken from JSON::XS.</p>
<p class="Pp">The interested reader might have seen a number of flags that
    signify encodings or codesets - <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;latin1&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;ascii&quot;</span>. There seems to be some confusion
    on what these do, so here is a short comparison:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span> controls whether the JSON
    text created by <span class="Li">&quot;encode&quot;</span> (and expected by
    <span class="Li">&quot;decode&quot;</span>) is UTF-8 encoded or not, while
    <span class="Li">&quot;latin1&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;ascii&quot;</span> only control whether
    <span class="Li">&quot;encode&quot;</span> escapes character values outside
    their respective codeset range. Neither of these flags conflict with each
    other, although some combinations make less sense than others.</p>
<p class="Pp">Care has been taken to make all flags symmetrical with respect to
    <span class="Li">&quot;encode&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;decode&quot;</span>, that is, texts encoded with any
    combination of these flag values will be correctly decoded when the same
    flags are used - in general, if you use different flag settings while
    encoding vs. when decoding you likely have a bug somewhere.</p>
<p class="Pp">Below comes a verbose discussion of these flags. Note that a
    &quot;codeset&quot; is simply an abstract set of character-codepoint pairs,
    while an encoding takes those codepoint numbers and <i>encodes</i> them, in
    our case into octets. Unicode is (among other things) a codeset, UTF-8 is an
    encoding, and ISO-8859-1 (= latin 1) and ASCII are both codesets <i>and</i>
    encodings at the same time, which can be confusing.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;utf8&quot; flag disabled</dt>
  <dd>When <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span> is disabled (the default),
      then
      <span class="Li">&quot;encode&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;decode&quot;</span>
      generate and expect Unicode strings, that is, characters with high ordinal
      Unicode values (&gt; 255) will be encoded as such characters, and likewise
      such characters are decoded as-is, no changes to them will be done, except
      &quot;(re-)interpreting&quot; them as Unicode codepoints or Unicode
      characters, respectively (to Perl, these are the same thing in strings
      unless you do funny/weird/dumb stuff).
    <p class="Pp">This is useful when you want to do the encoding yourself (e.g.
        when you want to have UTF-16 encoded JSON texts) or when some other
        layer does the encoding for you (for example, when printing to a
        terminal using a filehandle that transparently encodes to UTF-8 you
        certainly do NOT want to UTF-8 encode your data first and have Perl
        encode it another time).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;utf8&quot; flag enabled</dt>
  <dd>If the <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span>-flag is enabled,
      <span class="Li">&quot;encode&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;decode&quot;</span>
      will encode all characters using the corresponding UTF-8 multi-byte
      sequence, and will expect your input strings to be encoded as UTF-8, that
      is, no &quot;character&quot; of the input string must have any value &gt;
      255, as UTF-8 does not allow that.
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span> flag therefore
        switches between two modes: disabled means you will get a Unicode string
        in Perl, enabled means you get an UTF-8 encoded octet/binary string in
        Perl.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;latin1&quot; or &quot;ascii&quot; flags enabled</dt>
  <dd>With <span class="Li">&quot;latin1&quot;</span> (or
      <span class="Li">&quot;ascii&quot;</span>) enabled,
      <span class="Li">&quot;encode&quot;</span> will escape characters with
      ordinal values &gt; 255 (&gt; 127 with
      <span class="Li">&quot;ascii&quot;</span>) and encode the remaining
      characters as specified by the <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span>
      flag.
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span> is disabled, then
        the result is also correctly encoded in those character sets (as both
        are proper subsets of Unicode, meaning that a Unicode string with all
        character values &lt; 256 is the same thing as a ISO-8859-1 string, and
        a Unicode string with all character values &lt; 128 is the same thing as
        an ASCII string in Perl).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span> is enabled, you
        still get a correct UTF-8-encoded string, regardless of these flags,
        just some more characters will be escaped using
        <span class="Li">&quot;\uXXXX&quot;</span> then before.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that ISO-8859-1-<i>encoded</i> strings are not compatible
        with UTF-8 encoding, while ASCII-encoded strings are. That is because
        the ISO-8859-1 encoding is NOT a subset of UTF-8 (despite the ISO-8859-1
        <i>codeset</i> being a subset of Unicode), while ASCII is.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Surprisingly, <span class="Li">&quot;decode&quot;</span> will
        ignore these flags and so treat all input values as governed by the
        <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span> flag. If it is disabled, this
        allows you to decode ISO-8859-1- and ASCII-encoded strings, as both
        strict subsets of Unicode. If it is enabled, you can correctly decode
        UTF-8 encoded strings.</p>
    <p class="Pp">So neither <span class="Li">&quot;latin1&quot;</span> nor
        <span class="Li">&quot;ascii&quot;</span> are incompatible with the
        <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span> flag - they only govern when
        the JSON output engine escapes a character or not.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The main use for <span class="Li">&quot;latin1&quot;</span> is
        to relatively efficiently store binary data as JSON, at the expense of
        breaking compatibility with most JSON decoders.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The main use for <span class="Li">&quot;ascii&quot;</span> is
        to force the output to not contain characters with values &gt; 127,
        which means you can interpret the resulting string as UTF-8, ISO-8859-1,
        ASCII, KOI8-R or most about any character set and 8-bit-encoding, and
        still get the same data structure back. This is useful when your channel
        for JSON transfer is not 8-bit clean or the encoding might be mangled in
        between (e.g. in mail), and works because ASCII is a proper subset of
        most 8-bit and multibyte encodings in use in the world.</p>
