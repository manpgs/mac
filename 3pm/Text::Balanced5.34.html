<p class="Pp">The various <span class="Li">&quot;extract_...&quot;</span>
    subroutines may be used to extract a delimited substring, possibly after
    skipping a specified prefix string. By default, that prefix is optional
    whitespace (<span class="Li">&quot;/\s*/&quot;</span>), but you can change
    it to whatever you wish (see below).</p>
<p class="Pp">The substring to be extracted must appear at the current
    <span class="Li">&quot;pos&quot;</span> location of the string's variable
    (or at index zero, if no <span class="Li">&quot;pos&quot;</span> position is
    defined). In other words, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;extract_...&quot;</span> subroutines <i>don't</i>
    extract the first occurrence of a substring anywhere in a string (like an
    unanchored regex would). Rather, they extract an occurrence of the substring
    appearing immediately at the current matching position in the string (like a
    <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span>-anchored regex would).</p>

  Behaviour in List Contexts</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In a list context, all the subroutines return a list, the first
    three elements of which are always:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[0]</dt>
  <dd>The extracted string, including the specified delimiters. If the
      extraction fails <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> is
    returned.</dd>
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>The remainder of the input string (i.e. the characters after the extracted
      string). On failure, the entire string is returned.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>The skipped prefix (i.e. the characters before the extracted string). On
      failure, <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> is returned.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Note that in a list context, the contents of the original input
    text (the first argument) are not modified in any way.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, if the input text was passed in a variable, that
    variable's <span class="Li">&quot;pos&quot;</span> value is updated to point
    at the first character after the extracted text. That means that in a list
    context the various subroutines can be used much like regular expressions.
    For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    while ( $next = (extract_quotelike($text))[0] )
    {
        # process next quote-like (in $next)

<p class="Pp">In a scalar context, the extracted string is returned, having
    first been removed from the input text. Thus, the following code also
    processes each quote-like operation, but actually removes them from
    <span class="Li">$text:</span></p>

<pre>    while ( $next = extract_quotelike($text) )
    {
        # process next quote-like (in $next)
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that if the input text is a read-only string (i.e. a
    literal), no attempt is made to remove the extracted text.</p>
<p class="Pp">In a void context the behaviour of the extraction subroutines is
    exactly the same as in a scalar context, except (of course) that the
    extracted substring is not returned.</p>

<p class="Pp">Prefix patterns are matched without any trailing modifiers
    (<span class="Li">&quot;/gimsox&quot;</span> etc.) This can bite you if
    you're expecting a prefix specification like '.*?(?=&lt;H1&gt;)' to skip
    everything up to the first &lt;H1&gt; tag. Such a prefix pattern will only
    succeed if the &lt;H1&gt; tag is on the current line, since . normally
    doesn't match newlines.</p>
<p class="Pp">To overcome this limitation, you need to turn on /s matching
    within the prefix pattern, using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;(?s)&quot;</span> directive:
  '(?s).*?(?=&lt;H1&gt;)'</p>

  <dt>&quot;extract_delimited&quot;</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;extract_delimited&quot;</span> function
      formalizes the common idiom of extracting a single-character-delimited
      substring from the start of a string. For example, to extract a
      single-quote delimited string, the following code is typically used:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    ($remainder = $text) =~ s/\A('(\\.|[^'])*')//s;
    $extracted = $1;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">but with <span class="Li">&quot;extract_delimited&quot;</span>
        it can be simplified to:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    ($extracted,$remainder) = extract_delimited($text, &quot;'&quot;);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;extract_delimited&quot;</span> takes up
        to four scalars (the input text, the delimiters, a prefix pattern to be
        skipped, and any escape characters) and extracts the initial substring
        of the text that is appropriately delimited. If the delimiter string has
        multiple characters, the first one encountered in the text is taken to
        delimit the substring. The third argument specifies a prefix pattern
        that is to be skipped (but must be present!) before the substring is
        extracted. The final argument specifies the escape character to be used
        for each delimiter.</p>
    <p class="Pp">All arguments are optional. If the escape characters are not
        specified, every delimiter is escaped with a backslash
        (<span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span>). If the prefix is not specified,
        the pattern <span class="Li">'\s*'</span> - optional whitespace - is
        used. If the delimiter set is also not specified, the set
        <span class="Li">&quot;/[&quot;'`]/&quot;</span> is used. If the text to
        be processed is not specified either, <span class="Li">$_</span> is
        used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In list context,
        <span class="Li">&quot;extract_delimited&quot;</span> returns a array of
        three elements, the extracted substring (<i>including the
        surrounding</i> <i>delimiters</i>), the remainder of the text, and the
        skipped prefix (if any). If a suitable delimited substring is not found,
        the first element of the array is the empty string, the second is the
        complete original text, and the prefix returned in the third element is
        an empty string.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In a scalar context, just the extracted substring is returned.
        In a void context, the extracted substring (and any prefix) are simply
        removed from the beginning of the first argument.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # Remove a single-quoted substring from the very beginning of $text:
        $substring = extract_delimited($text, &quot;'&quot;, '');
    # Remove a single-quoted Pascalish substring (i.e. one in which
    # doubling the quote character escapes it) from the very
    # beginning of $text:
        $substring = extract_delimited($text, &quot;'&quot;, '', &quot;'&quot;);
    # Extract a single- or double- quoted substring from the
    # beginning of $text, optionally after some whitespace
    # (note the list context to protect $text from modification):
        ($substring) = extract_delimited $text, q{&quot;'};
    # Delete the substring delimited by the first '/' in $text:
        $text = join '', (extract_delimited($text,'/','[^/]*')[2,1];
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that this last example is <i>not</i> the same as deleting
        the first quote-like pattern. For instance, if
        <span class="Li">$text</span> contained the string:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    &quot;if ('./cmd' =~ m/$UNIXCMD/s) { $cmd = $1; }&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">then after the deletion it would contain:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    &quot;if ('.$UNIXCMD/s) { $cmd = $1; }&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">not:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    &quot;if ('./cmd' =~ ms) { $cmd = $1; }&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">See &quot;extract_quotelike&quot; for a (partial) solution to
        this problem.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;extract_bracketed&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Like <span class="Li">&quot;extract_delimited&quot;</span>, the
      <span class="Li">&quot;extract_bracketed&quot;</span> function takes up to
      three optional scalar arguments: a string to extract from, a delimiter
      specifier, and a prefix pattern. As before, a missing prefix defaults to
      optional whitespace and a missing text defaults to
      <span class="Li">$_</span>. However, a missing delimiter specifier
      defaults to <span class="Li">'{}()[]&lt;&gt;'</span> (see below).
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;extract_bracketed&quot;</span> extracts
        a balanced-bracket-delimited substring (using any one (or more) of the
        user-specified delimiter brackets: '(..)', '{..}', '[..]', or
        '&lt;..&gt;'). Optionally it will also respect quoted unbalanced
        brackets (see below).</p>
    <p class="Pp">A &quot;delimiter bracket&quot; is a bracket in list of
        delimiters passed as
        <span class="Li">&quot;extract_bracketed&quot;</span>'s second argument.
        Delimiter brackets are specified by giving either the left or right (or
        both!) versions of the required bracket(s). Note that the order in which
        two or more delimiter brackets are specified is not significant.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A &quot;balanced-bracket-delimited substring&quot; is a
        substring bounded by matched brackets, such that any other (left or
        right) delimiter bracket <i>within</i> the substring is also matched by
        an opposite (right or left) delimiter bracket <i>at the same level of
        nesting</i>. Any type of bracket not in the delimiter list is treated as
        an ordinary character.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In other words, each type of bracket specified as a delimiter
        must be balanced and correctly nested within the substring, and any
        other kind of (&quot;non-delimiter&quot;) bracket in the substring is
        ignored.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example, given the string:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $text = &quot;{ an '[irregularly :-(] {} parenthesized &gt;:-)' string }&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">then a call to
        <span class="Li">&quot;extract_bracketed&quot;</span> in a list
      context:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @result = extract_bracketed( $text, '{}' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">would return:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    ( &quot;{ an '[irregularly :-(] {} parenthesized &gt;:-)' string }&quot; , &quot;&quot; , &quot;&quot; )
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">since both sets of <span class="Li">'{..}'</span> brackets are
        properly nested and evenly balanced. (In a scalar context just the first
        element of the array would be returned. In a void context,
        <span class="Li">$text</span> would be replaced by an empty string.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Likewise the call in:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @result = extract_bracketed( $text, '{[' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">would return the same result, since all sets of both types of
        specified delimiter brackets are correctly nested and balanced.</p>
    <p class="Pp">However, the call in:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @result = extract_bracketed( $text, '{([&lt;' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">would fail, returning:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    ( undef , &quot;{ an '[irregularly :-(] {} parenthesized &gt;:-)' string }&quot;  );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">because the embedded pairs of <span class="Li">'(..)'</span>s
        and <span class="Li">'[..]'</span>s are &quot;cross-nested&quot; and the
        embedded <span class="Li">'&gt;'</span> is unbalanced. (In a scalar
        context, this call would return an empty string. In a void context,
        <span class="Li">$text</span> would be unchanged.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the embedded single-quotes in the string don't help
        in this case, since they have not been specified as acceptable
        delimiters and are therefore treated as non-delimiter characters (and
        ignored).</p>
    <p class="Pp">However, if a particular species of quote character is
        included in the delimiter specification, then that type of quote will be
        correctly handled. for example, if <span class="Li">$text</span> is:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $text = '&lt;A HREF=&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;&gt;link&lt;/A&gt;';
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">then</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @result = extract_bracketed( $text, '&lt;&quot;&gt;' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">returns:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    ( '&lt;A HREF=&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;&gt;', 'link&lt;/A&gt;', &quot;&quot; )
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">as expected. Without the specification of
        <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span> as an embedded quoter:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @result = extract_bracketed( $text, '&lt;&gt;' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">the result would be:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    ( '&lt;A HREF=&quot;&gt;', '&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;&gt;link&lt;/A&gt;', &quot;&quot; )
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In addition to the quote delimiters
        <span class="Li">&quot;'&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;`&quot;</span>, full Perl quote-like quoting
        (i.e. q{string}, qq{string}, etc) can be specified by including the
        letter 'q' as a delimiter. Hence:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @result = extract_bracketed( $text, '&lt;q&gt;' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">would correctly match something like this:</p>

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        [
                sub { extract_variable($_[0], '') },
                sub { extract_quotelike($_[0],'') },
                sub { extract_codeblock($_[0],'{}','') },
        ]
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>An number specifying the maximum number of fields to return. If this
      argument is omitted (or <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>), split
      continues as long as possible.
    <p class="Pp">If the third argument is <i>N</i>, then extraction continues
        until <i>N</i> fields have been successfully extracted, or until the
        string has been completely processed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that in scalar and void contexts the value of this
        argument is automatically reset to 1 (under
        <span class="Li">&quot;-w&quot;</span>, a warning is issued if the
        argument has to be reset).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>A value indicating whether unmatched substrings (see below) within the
      text should be skipped or returned as fields. If the value is true, such
      substrings are skipped. Otherwise, they are returned.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The extraction process works by applying each extractor in
    sequence to the text string.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the extractor is a subroutine it is called in a list context
    and is expected to return a list of a single element, namely the extracted
    text. It may optionally also return two further arguments: a string
    representing the text left after extraction (like $' for a pattern match),
    and a string representing any prefix skipped before the extraction (like $`
    in a pattern match). Note that this is designed to facilitate the use of
    other Text::Balanced subroutines with
    <span class="Li">&quot;extract_multiple&quot;</span>. Note too that the
    value returned by an extractor subroutine need not bear any relationship to
    the corresponding substring of the original text (see examples below).</p>
<p class="Pp">If the extractor is a precompiled regular expression or a string,
    it is matched against the text in a scalar context with a leading '\G' and
    the gc modifiers enabled. The extracted value is either
    <span class="Li">$1</span> if that variable is defined after the match, or
    else the complete match (i.e. $&amp;).</p>
<p class="Pp">If the extractor is a hash reference, it must contain exactly one
    element. The value of that element is one of the above extractor types
    (subroutine reference, regular expression, or string). The key of that
    element is the name of a class into which the successful return value of the
    extractor will be blessed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an extractor returns a defined value, that value is immediately
    treated as the next extracted field and pushed onto the list of fields. If
    the extractor was specified in a hash reference, the field is also blessed
    into the appropriate class,</p>
<p class="Pp">If the extractor fails to match (in the case of a regex
    extractor), or returns an empty list or an undefined value (in the case of a
    subroutine extractor), it is assumed to have failed to extract. If none of
    the extractor subroutines succeeds, then one character is extracted from the
    start of the text and the extraction subroutines reapplied. Characters which
    are thus removed are accumulated and eventually become the next field
    (unless the fourth argument is true, in which case they are discarded).</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the following extracts substrings that are valid Perl
    variables:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        @fields = extract_multiple($text,
                                   [ sub { extract_variable($_[0]) } ],
                                   undef, 1);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This example separates a text into fields which are quote
    delimited, curly bracketed, and anything else. The delimited and bracketed
    parts are also blessed to identify them (the &quot;anything else&quot; is
    unblessed):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        @fields = extract_multiple($text,
                   [
                        { Delim =&gt; sub { extract_delimited($_[0],q{'&quot;}) } },
                        { Brack =&gt; sub { extract_bracketed($_[0],'{}') } },
                   ]);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This call extracts the next single substring that is a valid Perl
    quotelike operator (and removes it from <span class="Li">$text</span>):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        $quotelike = extract_multiple($text,
                                      [
                                        sub { extract_quotelike($_[0]) },
                                      ], undef, 1);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Finally, here is yet another way to do comma-separated value
    parsing:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        @fields = extract_multiple($csv_text,
                                  [
                                        sub { extract_delimited($_[0],q{'&quot;}) },
                                        qr/([^,]+)(.*)/,
                                  ],
                                  undef,1);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The list in the second argument means: <i>&quot;Try and extract a
    ' or &quot; delimited string, otherwise extract anything up to a
    comma...&quot;</i>. The undef third argument means: <i>&quot;...as many
    times as possible...&quot;</i>, and the true value in the fourth argument
    means <i>&quot;...discarding anything else that appears (i.e. the
    commas)&quot;</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you wanted the commas preserved as separate fields (i.e. like
    split does if your split pattern has capturing parentheses), you would just
    make the last parameter undefined (or remove it).</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;gen_delimited_pat&quot;</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;gen_delimited_pat&quot;</span> subroutine takes
      a single (string) argument and
    <br/>
     &gt; builds a Friedl-style optimized regex that matches a string delimited
      by any one of the characters in the single argument. For example:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        gen_delimited_pat(q{'&quot;})
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">returns the regex:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        (?:\&quot;(?:\\\&quot;|(?!\&quot;).)*\&quot;|\'(?:\\\'|(?!\').)*\')
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the specified delimiters are automatically
        quotemeta'd.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A typical use of
        <span class="Li">&quot;gen_delimited_pat&quot;</span> would be to build
        special purpose tags for
        <span class="Li">&quot;extract_tagged&quot;</span>. For example, to
        properly ignore &quot;empty&quot; XML elements (which might contain
        quoted strings):</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        my $empty_tag = '&lt;(' . gen_delimited_pat(q{'&quot;}) . '|.)+/&gt;';
        extract_tagged($text, undef, undef, undef, {ignore =&gt; [$empty_tag]} );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;gen_delimited_pat&quot;</span> may also
        be called with an optional second argument, which specifies the
        &quot;escape&quot; character(s) to be used for each delimiter. For
        example to match a Pascal-style string (where ' is the delimiter and ''
        is a literal ' within the string):</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        gen_delimited_pat(q{'},q{'});
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Different escape characters can be specified for different
        delimiters. For example, to specify that '/' is the escape for single
        quotes and '%' is the escape for double quotes:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        gen_delimited_pat(q{'&quot;},q{/%});
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If more delimiters than escape chars are specified, the last
        escape char is used for the remaining delimiters. If no escape char is
        specified for a given specified delimiter, '\' is used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;delimited_pat&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Note that <span class="Li">&quot;gen_delimited_pat&quot;</span> was
      previously called <span class="Li">&quot;delimited_pat&quot;</span>. That
      name may still be used, but is now deprecated.</dd>
