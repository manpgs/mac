<p class="Pp">One recurring problem in modules that use Scalar::Util's
    <span class="Li">&quot;weaken&quot;</span> function is that it is not
    present in the pure-perl variant.</p>
<p class="Pp">While this isn't necessarily always a problem in a straight
    CPAN-based Perl environment, some operating system distributions only
    include the pure-Perl versions, don't include the XS version, and so weaken
    is then &quot;missing&quot; from the platform, <b>despite</b> passing a
    dependency on Scalar::Util successfully.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most notably this is RedHat Linux at time of writing, but other
    come and go and do the same thing, hence &quot;recurring problem&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The normal solution is to manually write tests in each
    distribution to ensure that <span class="Li">&quot;weaken&quot;</span> is
    available.</p>
<p class="Pp">This restores the functionality testing to a dependency you do
    once in your <i>Makefile.PL</i>, rather than something you have to write
    extra tests for each time you write a module.</p>
<p class="Pp">It should also help make the package auto-generators for the
    various operating systems play more nicely, because it introduces a
    dependency that they <b>have</b> to have a proper weaken in order to
  work.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_this_Task_works"><a class="permalink" href="#How_this_Task_works">How
  this Task works</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Part of the problem seems to stem from the fact that some
    distributions continue to include modules even if they fail some of their
    tests.</p>
<p class="Pp">To get around that for this module, it will do a few dirty
  tricks.</p>
<p class="Pp">If Scalar::Util is not available at all, it will issue a normal
    dependency on the module. However, if Scalar::Util is relatively new ( it is
    &gt;= 1.19 ) and the module does <b>not</b> have weaken, the install will
    bail out altogether with a long error encouraging the user to seek support
    from their vendor (this problem happens most often in vendor-packaged Perl
    versions).</p>
<p class="Pp">This distribution also contains tests to ensure that weaken is
    available using more normal methods.</p>
<p class="Pp">So if your module uses <span class="Li">&quot;weaken&quot;</span>,
    you can just add the following to your Module::Install-based
    <i>Makefile.PL</i> (or equivalent).</p>
