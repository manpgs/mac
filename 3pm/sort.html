<p class="Pp">With the <span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span> pragma you can
    control the behaviour of the builtin
    <span class="Li">&quot;sort()&quot;</span> function.</p>
<p class="Pp">A stable sort means that for records that compare equal, the
    original input ordering is preserved. Stability will matter only if elements
    that compare equal can be distinguished in some other way. That means that
    simple numerical and lexical sorts do not profit from stability, since equal
    elements are indistinguishable. However, with a comparison such as</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>   { substr($a, 0, 3) cmp substr($b, 0, 3) }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">stability might matter because elements that compare equal on the
    first 3 characters may be distinguished based on subsequent characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whether sorting is stable by default is an accident of
    implementation that can change (and has changed) between Perl versions. If
    stability is important, be sure to say so with a</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use sort 'stable';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;no sort&quot;</span> pragma doesn't
    <i>forbid</i> what follows, it just leaves the choice open. Thus, after</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  no sort 'stable';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">sorting may happen to be stable anyway.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="permalink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.10, this pragma is lexically scoped and takes effect
    at compile time. In earlier versions its effect was global and took effect
    at run-time; the documentation suggested using
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval()&quot;</span> to change the behaviour:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  { eval 'no sort &quot;stable&quot;';      # stability not wanted
    print sort::current . &quot;\n&quot;;
    @a = sort @b;
    eval 'use sort &quot;defaults&quot;';   # clean up, for others
  }
  { eval 'use sort qw(defaults stable)';     # force stability
    print sort::current . &quot;\n&quot;;
    @c = sort @d;
    eval 'use sort &quot;defaults&quot;';   # clean up, for others
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Such code no longer has the desired effect, for two reasons.
    Firstly, the use of <span class="Li">&quot;eval()&quot;</span> means that
    the sorting algorithm is not changed until runtime, by which time it's too
    late to have any effect. Secondly,
    <span class="Li">&quot;sort::current&quot;</span> is also called at
    run-time, when in fact the compile-time value of
    <span class="Li">&quot;sort::current&quot;</span> is the one that
  matters.</p>
<p class="Pp">So now this code would be written:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  { no sort &quot;stable&quot;;      # stability not wanted
    my $current;
    BEGIN { $current = sort::current; }
    print &quot;$current\n&quot;;
    @a = sort @b;
    # Pragmas go out of scope at the end of the block
  }
  { use sort qw(defaults stable);     # force stability
    my $current;
    BEGIN { $current = sort::current; }
    print &quot;$current\n&quot;;
    @c = sort @d;
  }
