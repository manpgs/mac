<p class="Pp">Historically, the former InterNIC managed (under the auspices of
    IANA) the allocation of IP numbers to ISPs and other organizations. This
    changed somewhat when the Regional Internet Registry system was started,
    with the creation of three (and later, four) Regional Internet Registries
    (RIRs) around the world, each managing the allocation of IP addresses to
    organizations within differing physical areas (see also RFC2050).</p>
<p class="Pp">This means that there is no central whois database for IP
  numbers.</p>
<p class="Pp">This module allows the user to lookup the RIR who has authority
    for a particular IP address. After finding out the authority for an IP
    address, it is possible to use the authority's whois server to lookup the
    netblock owner.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$auth = $reg-&gt;inet_atoauth(HOSTNAME)</dt>
  <dd>Takes a string giving the name of a host, and translates that to an
      two-letter string representing the regional Internet registry that has
      authority of that IP address:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  AR = ARIN (North America)

    <p class="Pp">Takes arguments of both the 'rtfm.mit.edu' type and
        '18.181.0.24'. If the host name cannot be resolved, returns undef. If
        the resolved IP address is not contained within the database, returns
        undef. For multi-homed hosts (hosts with more than one address), the
        first address found is returned.</p>

  <dt>$auth = $reg-&gt;inet_ntoauth(IP_ADDRESS)</dt>
  <dd>Takes a string (an opaque string as returned by
