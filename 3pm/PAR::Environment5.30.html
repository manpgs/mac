    variables</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">PAR uses various environment variables both during the building
    process of executables or PAR archives and the <i>use</i> of them. Since the
    wealth of combinations and settings might confuse one or the other (like
    me), this document is intended to document all environment variables which
    PAR uses.</p>
<p class="Pp">Wherever I want to refer to the <span class="Li">$ENV{FOO}</span>
    environment hash entry, I will usually talk about the
    <span class="Li">&quot;FOO&quot;</span> variable for brevity.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INDEX_OF_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"><a class="permalink" href="#INDEX_OF_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES">INDEX
  OF ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Please note that this is still very, very incomplete!
    Contributions welcome!</b></p>
<p class="Pp">For each variable, there should be a description what it contains,
    when it can be expected to exist (and contain meaningful information), when
    it is sensible to define it yourself, and what effect this has.</p>
<p class="Pp">Of course, the description may use examples.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PAR_0</h2>
<p class="Pp">If the running program is run from within a PAR archive or
    pp-produced executable, this variable contains the name of the extracted
    program (i.e. .pl file). This is useful of you want to open the source code
    file of the running program.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, if you package a file <i>foo.pl</i> into
    <i>bar.par</i> and run <i>foo.pl</i> with this command</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  par.pl foo.par bar.pl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">then the <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_0&quot;</span> variable will
    contain something like
    <span class="Li">&quot;/tmp/par-youser/cache-b175f53eb731da9594e0dde337d66013ddf25a44/495829f0.pl&quot;</span>
    where <span class="Li">&quot;youser&quot;</span> is your username and
    <span class="Li">&quot;/tmp/par-youser/cache-b175f53eb731da9594e0dde337d66013ddf25a44/&quot;</span>
    is the PAR cache directory
  (<span class="Li">&quot;PAR_TEMP&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The name of the PAR cache directory can take a number of different
    forms, so use <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_0&quot;</span> if you want to find
    the extracted program's .pl file -- attempting to construct the name
    yourself requires complex logic that has already produced the value in
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_0&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This works the same for executable binaries (<i>.exe</i>,
  ...).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are looking for the name and path of the pp-ed binary file,
    please refer to the <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_PROGNAME&quot;</span>
    variable.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PAR_CLEAN</h2>
<p class="Pp">Users should set
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_GLOBAL_CLEAN&quot;</span> instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Recreated from
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_GLOBAL_CLEAN&quot;</span> and the value of
    <span class="Li">&quot;-C&quot;</span> from the YAML file by the PAR loader,
    and used within loader to control the initial behavior of extraction, and
    the final behavior of cleanup. The user can reference
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_CLEAN&quot;</span> in the application to
    determine which of these behaviors is being used for this run of the
    application.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PAR_DEBUG</h2>
<p class="Pp">Users should set
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_GLOBAL_DEBUG&quot;</span> instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">If this variable is set to a true value and <i>par.pl</i> is run,
    verbose output is sent to STDOUT or the logging filehandle. This is
    overridden by the <span class="Li">&quot;-q&quot;</span> option to
    <i>par.pl</i>, for steps after argument parsing occurs.</p>
<p class="Pp">This currently only influences <i>par.pl</i>. Whether this is the
    intended behaviour remains to be verified.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PAR_GLOBAL_CLEAN</h2>
<p class="Pp">Setting <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_GLOBAL_CLEAN&quot;</span>
    alters the behavior of par applications which see that environment variable
    at launch. <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_GLOBAL_CLEAN&quot;</span> overrides
    the <span class="Li">&quot;-C&quot;</span> option. Settings of 0 and 1 are
    supported. 0 corresponds to not using <span class="Li">&quot;-C&quot;</span>
    on the pp command line; 1 corresponds to using
    <span class="Li">&quot;-C&quot;</span> on the pp command line.
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_GLOBAL_CLEAN&quot;</span> is ignored if
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_GLOBAL_TEMP&quot;</span> is set, yet it controls
    the form of <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_TEMP&quot;</span> when
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_GLOBAL_TEMP&quot;</span> is not set.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PAR_GLOBAL_DEBUG</h2>
<p class="Pp">The PAR loader becomes more verbose when
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_DEBUG&quot;</span> is set. Setting
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_GLOBAL_DEBUG&quot;</span> guarantees that
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_DEBUG&quot;</span> will be set internally,
    initially. See <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_DEBUG&quot;</span> for more
    details.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PAR_GLOBAL_TEMP</h2>
<p class="Pp">Contributes to the calculation of
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_TEMP&quot;</span>, and is further explained
    there.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PAR_GLOBAL_TMPDIR</h2>
<p class="Pp">Contributes to the calculation of
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_TEMP&quot;</span>, and is further explained
    there.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PAR_INITIALIZED</h2>
<p class="Pp">This environment variable is for internal use by the PAR binary
    loader only. Documented only to avoid surprises if spawned applications
    expect to see a value initialized by the user.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PAR_PROGNAME</h2>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;PAR_PROGNAME&quot;</span> is set to the
    fully-qualified path name of the executable program. On Windows, this is
    reliably obtained from the
    <span class="Li">&quot;GetModuleFileName&quot;</span> API. On other OSes, if
    the C runtime is given a qualified path name, it is used, or the unqualified
    file name given is qualified by walking the path. This is reasonably
    reliable given normal program spawning conventions, but cannot be guaranteed
    to be correct in all circumstances.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PAR_APP_REUSE</h2>
<p class="Pp">Strictly internal. Skip this section if you're not a PAR
    developer.</p>
<p class="Pp">The variable shouldn't ever be exposed to user code and packaged
    applications should not depend on it being set or not.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an application has been packaged with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;--reusable&quot;</span> option, the bootstrapping
    code will set this environment variable to the name of the program that is
    to be run instead of the packaged program. The <i>main.pl</i> loader script
    fetches the file name, deletes the environment variable, and then runs the
    given program.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PAR_RUN</h2>
<p class="Pp">This environment variable was set during constructions of
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR::Packer&quot;</span> objects (usually during
    <i>pp</i> runs only) by versions of PAR up to 0.957. Since PAR 0.958, this
    variable is unused.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PAR_SPAWNED</h2>
<p class="Pp">This variable is used internally by the <i>parl</i> binary loader
    to signal the child process that it's the child.</p>
<p class="Pp">You should not rely on this variable outside of the PAR binary
    loader code. For a slightly more detailed discussion, please refer to the
    <i>who_am_i.txt</i> documentation file in the PAR source distribution which
    was contributed by Alan Stewart.</p>
<p class="Pp">Documented only to avoid surprises if spawned applications expect
    to see a value initialized by the user.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PAR_TEMP</h2>
<p class="Pp">Users should set
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_GLOBAL_TEMP&quot;</span> instead.
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_TEMP&quot;</span> is calculated from a variety of
    other variables. See the <span class="Li">&quot;NOTES&quot;</span> section
    in the pod for PAR.pm for a complete description of how the calculation
    proceeds. <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_TEMP&quot;</span>, once calculated, is
    used as the location where PAR stores its extracted, temporary file
  cache.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PAR_TMPDIR</h2>
<p class="Pp">Contributes to the calculation of
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_TEMP&quot;</span>, and is further explained
    there. Users should set
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_GLOBAL_TMPDIR&quot;</span> instead.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PAR_VERBATIM</h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_VERBATIM&quot;</span> variable
    controls the way Perl code is packaged into a PAR archive or binary
    executable. If it is set to a true value during the packaging process,
    modules (and scripts) are <b>not</b> passed through the default
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR::Filter::PodStrip&quot;</span> filter which
    removes all POD documentation from the code. Note that the
    <span class="Li">&quot;PAR::Filter::PatchContent&quot;</span> filter is
    still applied.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;-F&quot;</span> option to the <i>pp</i>
    tool overrides the <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_VERBATIM&quot;</span> setting.
    That means if you set <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_VERBATIM=1&quot;</span> but
    specify <span class="Li">&quot;-F PodStrip&quot;</span> on the
    <span class="Li">&quot;pp&quot;</span> command line, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;PodStrip&quot;</span> filter will be applied.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;PAR_VERBATIM&quot;</span> is not used by
    the PAR application.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PAR_VERBOSE</h2>
<p class="Pp">Setting this environment variable to a positive integer has the
    same effect as using the <span class="Li">&quot;-verbose&quot;</span> switch
    to <i>pp</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PP_OPTS</h2>
<p class="Pp">During a <i>pp</i> run, the contents of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;PP_OPTS&quot;</span> variable are treated as if they
    were part of the command line. In newer versions of PAR, you can also write
    options to a file and execute <i>pp</i> as follows to read the options from
    the file:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  pp @FILENAME
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That can, of course, be combined with other command line arguments
    to <i>pp</i> or the <span class="Li">&quot;PP_OPTS&quot;</span>
  variable.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">TMP, TEMP, TMPDIR, TEMPDIR</h2>
<p class="Pp">Please refer to
  <span class="Li">&quot;PAR_TMPDIR&quot;</span>.</p>
