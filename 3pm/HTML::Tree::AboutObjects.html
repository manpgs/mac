<p class="Pp">-- Sean M. Burke</p>
<p class="Pp">The first time that most Perl programmers run into object-oriented
    programming when they need to use a module whose interface is
    object-oriented. This is often a mystifying experience, since talk of
    &quot;methods&quot; and &quot;constructors&quot; is unintelligible to
    programmers who thought that functions and variables was all there was to
    worry about.</p>
<p class="Pp">Articles and books that explain object-oriented programming (OOP),
    do so in terms of how to program that way. That's understandable, and if you
    learn to write object-oriented code of your own, you'd find it easy to use
    object-oriented code that others write. But this approach is the <i>long</i>
    way around for people whose immediate goal is just to use existing
    object-oriented modules, but who don't yet want to know all the gory details
    of having to write such modules for themselves.</p>
<p class="Pp">This article is for those programmers -- programmers who want to
    know about objects from the perspective of using object-oriented
  modules.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Modules_and_Their_Functional_Interfaces"><a class="permalink" href="#Modules_and_Their_Functional_Interfaces">Modules
  and Their Functional Interfaces</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Modules are the main way that Perl provides for bundling up code
    for later use by yourself or others. As I'm sure you can't help noticing
    from reading <i>The Perl Journal</i>, CPAN (the Comprehensive Perl Archive
    Network) is the repository for modules (or groups of modules) that others
    have written, to do anything from composing music to accessing Web pages. A
    good deal of those modules even come with every installation of Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">One module that you may have used before, and which is fairly
    typical in its interface, is Text::Wrap. It comes with Perl, so you don't
    even need to install it from CPAN. You use it in a program of yours, by
    having your program code say early on:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use Text::Wrap;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and after that, you can access a function called
    <span class="Li">&quot;wrap&quot;</span>, which inserts line-breaks in text
    that you feed it, so that the text will be wrapped to seventy-two (or
    however many) columns.</p>
<p class="Pp">The way this <span class="Li">&quot;use Text::Wrap&quot;</span>
    business works is that the module Text::Wrap exists as a file
    &quot;Text/Wrap.pm&quot; somewhere in one of your library directories. That
    file contains Perl code...</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Footnote: And mixed in with the Perl code, there's
  documentation, which is what you read with &quot;perldoc Text::Wrap&quot;. The
  perldoc program simply ignores the code and formats the documentation text,
  whereas &quot;use Text::Wrap&quot; loads and runs the code while ignoring the
  documentation.</div>
<p class="Pp">...which, among other things, defines a function called
    <span class="Li">&quot;Text::Wrap::wrap&quot;</span>, and then
    <span class="Li">&quot;exports&quot;</span> that function, which means that
    when you say <span class="Li">&quot;wrap&quot;</span> after having said
    &quot;use Text::Wrap&quot;, you'll be actually calling the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Text::Wrap::wrap&quot;</span> function. Some modules
    don't export their functions, so you have to call them by their full name,
    like
  <span class="Li">&quot;Text::Wrap::wrap(...parameters...)&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Regardless of whether the typical module exports the functions it
    provides, a module is basically just a container for chunks of code that do
    useful things. The way the module allows for you to interact with it, is its
    <i>interface</i>. And when, like with Text::Wrap, its interface consists of
    functions, the module is said to have a <b>functional</b>
  <b>interface</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Footnote: the term &quot;function&quot; (and therefore
  &quot;function<i>al</i>&quot;) has various senses. I'm using the term here in
  its broadest sense, to refer to routines -- bits of code that are called by
  some name and which take parameters and return some value.</div>
<p class="Pp">Using modules with functional interfaces is straightforward --
    instead of defining your own &quot;wrap&quot; function with
    <span class="Li">&quot;sub wrap { ... }&quot;</span>, you entrust &quot;use
    Text::Wrap&quot; to do that for you, along with whatever other functions its
    defines and exports, according to the module's documentation. Without too
    much bother, you can even write your own modules to contain your frequently
    used functions; I suggest having a look at the
    <span class="Li">&quot;perlmod&quot;</span> man page for more leads on doing
    this.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Modules_with_Object-Oriented_Interfaces"><a class="permalink" href="#Modules_with_Object-Oriented_Interfaces">Modules
  with Object-Oriented Interfaces</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">So suppose that one day you want to write a program that will
    automate the process of <span class="Li">&quot;ftp&quot;</span>ing a bunch
    of files from one server down to your local machine, and then off to another
    server.</p>
<p class="Pp">A quick browse through search.cpan.org turns up the module
    &quot;Net::FTP&quot;, which you can download and install it using normal
    installation instructions (unless your sysadmin has already installed it, as
    many have).</p>
<p class="Pp">Like Text::Wrap or any other module with a familiarly functional
    interface, you start off using Net::FTP in your program by saying:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use Net::FTP;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, that's where the similarity ends. The first hint of
    difference is that the documentation for Net::FTP refers to it as a
    <b>class</b>. A class is a kind of module, but one that has an
    object-oriented interface.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whereas modules like Text::Wrap provide bits of useful code as
    <i>functions</i>, to be called like
    <span class="Li">&quot;function(...parameters...)&quot;</span> or like
    <span class="Li">&quot;PackageName::function(...parameters...)&quot;</span>,
    Net::FTP and other modules with object-oriented interfaces provide
    <b>methods</b>. Methods are sort of like functions in that they have a name
    and parameters; but methods look different, and are different, because you
    have to call them with a syntax that has a class name or an object as a
    special argument. I'll explain the syntax for method calls, and then later
    explain what they all mean.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some methods are meant to be called as <b>class methods</b>, with
    the class name (same as the module name) as a special argument. Class
    methods look like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  ClassName-&gt;methodname(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
  ClassName-&gt;methodname()   # if no parameters
  ClassName-&gt;methodname     # same as above
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which you will sometimes see written:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  methodname ClassName (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
  methodname ClassName      # if no parameters
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Basically all class methods are for making new objects, and
    methods that make objects are called &quot;<b>constructors</b>&quot; (and
    the process of making them is called &quot;constructing&quot; or
    &quot;instantiating&quot;). Constructor methods typically have the name
    &quot;new&quot;, or something including &quot;new&quot;
    (&quot;new_from_file&quot;, etc.); but they can conceivably be named
    anything -- DBI's constructor method is named &quot;connect&quot;, for
    example.</p>
<p class="Pp">The object that a constructor method returns is typically captured
    in a scalar variable:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $object = ClassName-&gt;new(param1, param2...);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Once you have an object (more later on exactly what that is), you
    can use the other kind of method call syntax, the syntax for <b>object
    method</b> calls. Calling object methods is just like class methods, except
    that instead of the ClassName as the special argument, you use an expression
    that yeilds an &quot;object&quot;. Usually this is just a scalar variable
    that you earlier captured the output of the constructor in. Object method
    calls look like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $object-&gt;methodname(parameter1, parameter2, ...);
  $object-&gt;methodname()   # if no parameters
  $object-&gt;methodname     # same as above
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which is occasionally written as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  methodname $object (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
  methodname $object      # if no parameters
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Examples of method calls are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my $session1 = Net::FTP-&gt;new(&quot;ftp.myhost.com&quot;);
    # Calls a class method &quot;new&quot;, from class Net::FTP,
    #  with the single parameter &quot;ftp.myhost.com&quot;,
    #  and saves the return value (which is, as usual,
    #  an object), in $session1.
    # Could also be written:
    #  new Net::FTP('ftp.myhost.com')
  $session1-&gt;login(&quot;sburke&quot;,&quot;aoeuaoeu&quot;)
    || die &quot;failed to login!\n&quot;;
     # calling the object method &quot;login&quot;
  print &quot;Dir:\n&quot;, $session1-&gt;dir(), &quot;\n&quot;;
  $session1-&gt;quit;
    # same as $session1-&gt;quit()
  print &quot;Done\n&quot;;
  exit;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Incidentally, I suggest always using the syntaxes with parentheses
    and &quot;-&gt;&quot; in them,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Footnote: the character-pair &quot;-&gt;&quot; is
  supposed to look like an arrow, not &quot;negative greater-than&quot;!</div>
<p class="Pp">and avoiding the syntaxes that start out &quot;methodname
    <span class="Li">$object</span>&quot; or &quot;methodname ModuleName&quot;.
    When everything's going right, they all mean the same thing as the
    &quot;-&gt;&quot; variants, but the syntax with &quot;-&gt;&quot; is more
    visually distinct from function calls, as well as being immune to some kinds
    of rare but puzzling ambiguities that can arise when you're trying to call
    methods that have the same name as subroutines you've defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">But, syntactic alternatives aside, all this talk of constructing
    objects and object methods begs the question -- what <i>is</i> an object?
    There are several angles to this question that the rest of this article will
    answer in turn: what can you do with objects? what's in an object? what's an
    object value? and why do some modules use objects at all?</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What_Can_You_Do_with_Objects?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_Can_You_Do_with_Objects?">What
  Can You Do with Objects?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You've seen that you can make objects, and call object methods
    with them. But what are object methods for? The answer depends on the
  class:</p>
<p class="Pp">A Net::FTP object represents a session between your computer and
    an FTP server. So the methods you call on a Net::FTP object are for doing
    whatever you'd need to do across an FTP connection. You make the session and
    log in:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my $session = Net::FTP-&gt;new('ftp.aol.com');
  die &quot;Couldn't connect!&quot; unless defined $session;
    # The class method call to &quot;new&quot; will return
    # the new object if it goes OK, otherwise it
    # will return undef.
    
  $session-&gt;login('sburke', 'p@ssw3rD')
   || die &quot;Did I change my password again?&quot;;
    # The object method &quot;login&quot; will give a true
    # return value if actually logs in, otherwise
    # it'll return false.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can use the session object to change directory on that
    session:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $session-&gt;cwd(&quot;/home/sburke/public_html&quot;)
     || die &quot;Hey, that was REALLY supposed to work!&quot;;
   # if the cwd fails, it'll return false
</pre>
<p class="Pp">...get files from the machine at the other end of the
  session...</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  foreach my $f ('log_report_ua.txt', 'log_report_dom.txt',
                 'log_report_browsers.txt')
  {
    $session-&gt;get($f) || warn &quot;Getting $f failed!&quot;
  };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">...and plenty else, ending finally with closing the
  connection:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $session-&gt;quit();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In short, object methods are for doing things related to (or with)
    whatever the object represents. For FTP sessions, it's about sending
    commands to the server at the other end of the connection, and that's about
    it -- there, methods are for doing something to the world outside the
    object, and the objects is just something that specifies what bit of the
    world (well, what FTP session) to act upon.</p>
<p class="Pp">With most other classes, however, the object itself stores some
    kind of information, and it typically makes no sense to do things with such
    an object without considering the data that's in the object.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What's_"><a class="permalink" href="#What's_">What's
  <i>in</i> an Object?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">An object is (with rare exceptions) a data structure containing a
    bunch of attributes, each of which has a value, as well as a name that you
    use when you read or set the attribute's value. Some of the object's
    attributes are private, meaning you'll never see them documented because
    they're not for you to read or write; but most of the object's documented
    attributes are at least readable, and usually writeable, by you. Net::FTP
    objects are a bit thin on attributes, so we'll use objects from the class
    Business::US_Amort for this example. Business::US_Amort is a very simple
    class (available from CPAN) that I wrote for making calculations to do with
    loans (specifically, amortization, using US-style algorithms).</p>
<p class="Pp">An object of the class Business::US_Amort represents a loan with
    particular parameters, i.e., attributes. The most basic attributes of a
    &quot;loan object&quot; are its interest rate, its principal (how much money
    it's for), and it's term (how long it'll take to repay). You need to set
    these attributes before anything else can be done with the object. The way
    to get at those attributes for loan objects is just like the way to get at
    attributes for any class's objects: through accessors. An <b>accessor</b> is
    simply any method that accesses (whether reading or writing, AKA getting or
    putting) some attribute in the given object. Moreover, accessors are the
    <b>only</b> way that you can change an object's attributes. (If a module's
    documentation wants you to know about any other way, it'll tell you.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Usually, for simplicity's sake, an accessor is named after the
    attribute it reads or writes. With Business::US_Amort objects, the accessors
    you need to use first are <span class="Li">&quot;principal&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;interest_rate&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;term&quot;</span>. Then, with at least those
    attributes set, you can call the <span class="Li">&quot;run&quot;</span>
    method to figure out several things about the loan. Then you can call
    various accessors, like
    <span class="Li">&quot;total_paid_toward_interest&quot;</span>, to read the
    results:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use Business::US_Amort;
  my $loan = Business::US_Amort-&gt;new;
  # Set the necessary attributes:
  $loan-&gt;principal(123654);
  $loan-&gt;interest_rate(9.25);
  $loan-&gt;term(20); # twenty years
  # NOW we know enough to calculate:
  $loan-&gt;run;
  
  # And see what came of that:
  print
    &quot;Total paid toward interest: A WHOPPING &quot;,
    $loan-&gt;total_paid_interest, &quot;!!\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This illustrates a convention that's common with accessors:
    calling the accessor with no arguments (as with
    <span class="Li">$loan</span>-&gt;total_paid_interest) usually means to read
    the value of that attribute, but providing a value (as with
    <span class="Li">$loan</span>-&gt;term(20)) means you want that attribute to
    be set to that value. This stands to reason: why would you be providing a
    value, if not to set the attribute to that value?</p>
<p class="Pp">Although a loan's term, principal, and interest rates are all
    single numeric values, an objects values can any kind of scalar, or an
    array, or even a hash. Moreover, an attribute's value(s) can be objects
    themselves. For example, consider MIDI files (as I wrote about in TPJ#13): a
    MIDI file usually consists of several tracks. A MIDI file is complex enough
    to merit being an object with attributes like its overall tempo, the
    file-format variant it's in, and the list of instrument tracks in the file.
    But tracks themselves are complex enough to be objects too, with attributes
    like their track-type, a list of MIDI commands if they're a MIDI track, or
    raw data if they're not. So I ended up writing the MIDI modules so that the
    &quot;tracks&quot; attribute of a MIDI::Opus object is an array of objects
    from the class MIDI::Track. This may seem like a runaround -- you ask what's
    in one object, and get <i>another</i> object, or several! But in this case,
    it exactly reflects what the module is for -- MIDI files contain MIDI
    tracks, which then contain data.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is_an_Object_Value?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is_an_Object_Value?">What
  is an Object Value?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When you call a constructor like
    Net::FTP-&gt;new(<i>hostname</i>), you get back an object value, a value you
    can later use, in combination with a method name, to call object
  methods.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now, so far we've been pretending, in the above examples, that the
    variables <span class="Li">$session</span> or <span class="Li">$loan</span>
    <i>are</i> the objects you're dealing with. This idea is innocuous up to a
    point, but it's really a misconception that will, at best, limit you in what
    you know how to do. The reality is not that the variables
    <span class="Li">$session</span> or <span class="Li">$query</span> are
    objects; it's a little more indirect -- they <i>hold</i> values that
    symbolize objects. The kind of value that <span class="Li">$session</span>
    or <span class="Li">$query</span> hold is what I'm calling an object
  value.</p>
<p class="Pp">To understand what kind of value this is, first think about the
    other kinds of scalar values you know about: The first two scalar values you
    probably ever ran into in Perl are <b>numbers</b> and <b>strings</b>, which
    you learned (or just assumed) will usually turn into each other on demand;
    that is, the three-character string &quot;2.5&quot; can become the quantity
    two and a half, and vice versa. Then, especially if you started using
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -w&quot;</span> early on, you learned about the
    <b>undefined value</b>, which can turn into 0 if you treat it as a number,
    or the empty-string if you treat it as a string.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Footnote: You may <i>also</i> have been learning about
  references, in which case you're ready to hear that object values are just a
  kind of reference, except that they reflect the class that created thing they
  point to, instead of merely being a plain old array reference, hash reference,
  etc. <i>If</i> this makes makes sense to you, and you want to know more about
  how objects are implemented in Perl, have a look at the
  <span class="Li">&quot;perltoot&quot;</span> man page.</div>
<p class="Pp">And now you're learning about <b>object values</b>. An object
    value is a value that points to a data structure somewhere in memory, which
    is where all the attributes for this object are stored. That data structure
    as a whole belongs to a class (probably the one you named in the constructor
    method, like ClassName-&gt;new), so that the object value can be used as
    part of object method calls.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to actually <i>see</i> what an object value is, you
    might try just saying &quot;print <span class="Li">$object</span>&quot;.
    That'll get you something like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  Net::FTP=GLOB(0x20154240)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  Business::US_Amort=HASH(0x15424020)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That's not very helpful if you wanted to really get at the
    object's insides, but that's because the object value is only a symbol for
    the object. This may all sound very abstruse and metaphysical, so a
    real-world allegory might be very helpful:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">You get an advertisement in the mail saying that you have
  been (im)personally selected to have the rare privilege of applying for a
  credit card. For whatever reason, <i>this</i> offer sounds good to you, so you
  fill out the form and mail it back to the credit card company. They gleefully
  approve the application and create your account, and send you a card with a
  number on it.
<p class="Pp">Now, you can do things with the number on that card -- clerks at
    stores can ring up things you want to buy, and charge your account by keying
    in the number on the card. You can pay for things you order online by
    punching in the card number as part of your online order. You can pay off
    part of the account by sending the credit card people some of your money
    (well, a check) with some note (usually the pre-printed slip) that has the
    card number for the account you want to pay toward. And you should be able
    to call the credit card company's computer and ask it things about the card,
    like its balance, its credit limit, its APR, and maybe an itemization of
    recent purchases ad payments.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now, what you're <i>really</i> doing is manipulating a credit card
    <i>account</i>, a completely abstract entity with some data attached to it
    (balance, APR, etc). But for ease of access, you have a credit card
    <i>number</i> that is a symbol for that account. Now, that symbol is just a
    bunch of digits, and the number is effectively meaningless and useless in
    and of itself -- but in the appropriate context, it's understood to
    <i>mean</i> the credit card account you're accessing.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This is exactly the relationship between objects and object
    values, and from this analogy, several facts about object values are a bit
    more explicable:</p>
<p class="Pp">* An object value does nothing in and of itself, but it's useful
    when you use it in the context of an
    <span class="Li">$object</span>-&gt;method call, the same way that a card
    number is useful in the context of some operation dealing with a card
    account.</p>
<p class="Pp">Moreover, several copies of the same object value all refer to the
    same object, the same way that making several copies of your card number
    won't change the fact that they all still refer to the same single account
    (this is true whether you're &quot;copying&quot; the number by just writing
    it down on different slips of paper, or whether you go to the trouble of
    forging exact replicas of your own plastic credit card). That's why
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $x = Net::FTP-&gt;new(&quot;ftp.aol.com&quot;);
  $x-&gt;login(&quot;sburke&quot;, &quot;aoeuaoeu&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">does the same thing as this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $x = Net::FTP-&gt;new(&quot;ftp.aol.com&quot;);
  $y = $x;
  $z = $y;
  $z-&gt;login(&quot;sburke&quot;, &quot;aoeuaoeu&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That is, <span class="Li">$z</span> and <span class="Li">$y</span>
    and <span class="Li">$x</span> are three different <i>slots</i> for values,
    but what's in those slots are all object values pointing to the same object
    -- you don't have three different FTP connections, just three variables with
    values pointing to the some single FTP connection.</p>
<p class="Pp">* You can't tell much of anything about the object just by looking
    at the object value, any more than you can see your credit account balance
    by holding the plastic card up to the light, or by adding up the digits in
    your credit card number.</p>
<p class="Pp">* You can't just make up your own object values and have them work
    -- they can come only from constructor methods of the appropriate class.
    Similarly, you get a credit card number <i>only</i> by having a bank approve
    your application for a credit card account -- at which point <i>they</i> let
    <i>you</i> know what the number of your new card is.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now, there's even more to the fact that you can't just make up
    your own object value: even though you can print an object value and get a
    string like &quot;Net::FTP=GLOB(0x20154240)&quot;, that string is just a
    <i>representation</i> of an object value.</p>
<p class="Pp">Internally, an object value has a basically different type from a
    string, or a number, or the undefined value -- if <span class="Li">$x</span>
    holds a real string, then that value's slot in memory says &quot;this is a
    value of type <i>string</i>, and its characters are...&quot;, whereas if
    it's an object value, the value's slot in memory says, &quot;this is a value
    of type <i>reference</i>, and the location in memory that it points to
    is...&quot; (and by looking at what's at that location, Perl can tell the
    class of what's there).</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl programmers typically don't have to think about all these
    details of Perl's internals. Many other languages force you to be more
    conscious of the differences between all of these (and also between types of
    numbers, which are stored differently depending on their size and whether
    they have fractional parts). But Perl does its best to hide the different
    types of scalars from you -- it turns numbers into strings and back as
    needed, and takes the string or number representation of undef or of object
    values as needed. However, you can't go from a string representation of an
    object value, back to an object value. And that's why this doesn't work:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>   $x = Net::FTP-&gt;new('ftp.aol.com');
   $y = Net::FTP-&gt;new('ftp.netcom.com');
   $z = Net::FTP-&gt;new('ftp.qualcomm.com');
   $all = join(' ', $x,$y,$z);           # !!!
  ...later...
   ($aol, $netcom, $qualcomm) = split(' ', $all);  # !!!
   $aol-&gt;login(&quot;sburke&quot;, &quot;aoeuaoeu&quot;);
   $netcom-&gt;login(&quot;sburke&quot;, &quot;qjkxqjkx&quot;);
   $qualcomm-&gt;login(&quot;smb&quot;, &quot;dhtndhtn&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This fails because <span class="Li">$aol</span> ends up holding
    merely the <b>string representation</b> of the object value from
    <span class="Li">$x</span>, not the object value itself -- when
    <span class="Li">&quot;join&quot;</span> tried to join the characters of the
    &quot;strings&quot; <span class="Li">$x</span>, <span class="Li">$y</span>,
    and <span class="Li">$z</span>, Perl saw that they weren't strings at all,
    so it gave <span class="Li">&quot;join&quot;</span> their string
    representations.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unfortunately, this distinction between object values and their
    string representations doesn't really fit into the analogy of credit card
    numbers, because credit card numbers really <i>are</i> numbers -- even
    thought they don't express any meaningful quantity, if you stored them in a
    database as a quantity (as opposed to just an ASCII string), that wouldn't
    stop them from being valid as credit card numbers.</p>
<p class="Pp">This may seem rather academic, but there's there's two common
    mistakes programmers new to objects often make, which make sense only in
    terms of the distinction between object values and their string
    representations:</p>
<p class="Pp">The first common error involves forgetting (or never having known
    in the first place) that when you go to use a value as a hash key, Perl uses
    the string representation of that value. When you want to use the numeric
    value two and a half as a key, Perl turns it into the three-character string
    &quot;2.5&quot;. But if you then want to use that string as a number, Perl
    will treat it as meaning two and a half, so you're usually none the wiser
    that Perl converted the number to a string and back. But recall that Perl
    can't turn strings back into objects -- so if you tried to use a Net::FTP
    object value as a hash key, Perl actually used its string representation,
    like &quot;Net::FTP=GLOB(0x20154240)&quot;, but that string is unusable as
    an object value. (Incidentally, there's a module Tie::RefHash that
    implements hashes that <i>do</i> let you use real object-values as
  keys.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The second common error with object values is in trying to save an
    object value to disk (whether printing it to a file, or storing it in a
    conventional database file). All you'll get is the string, which will be
    useless.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you want to save an object and restore it later, you may find
    that the object's class already provides a method specifically for this. For
    example, MIDI::Opus provides methods for writing an object to disk as a
    standard MIDI file. The file can later be read back into memory by a
    MIDI::Opus constructor method, which will return a new MIDI::Opus object
    representing whatever file you tell it to read into memory. Similar methods
    are available with, for example, classes that manipulate graphic images and
    can save them to files, which can be read back later.</p>
<p class="Pp">But some classes, like Business::US_Amort, provide no such methods
    for storing an object in a file. When this is the case, you can try using
    any of the Data::Dumper, Storable, or FreezeThaw modules. Using these will
    be unproblematic for objects of most classes, but it may run into
    limitations with others. For example, a Business::US_Amort object can be
    turned into a string with Data::Dumper, and that string written to a file.
    When it's restored later, its attributes will be accessible as normal. But
    in the unlikely case that the loan object was saved in mid-calculation, the
    calculation may not be resumable. This is because of the way that that
    <i>particular</i> class does its calculations, but similar limitations may
    occur with objects from other classses.</p>
<p class="Pp">But often, even <i>wanting</i> to save an object is basically
    wrong -- what would saving an ftp <i>session</i> even mean? Saving the
    hostname, username, and password? current directory on both machines? the
    local TCP/IP port number? In the case of &quot;saving&quot; a Net::FTP
    object, you're better off just saving whatever details you actually need for
    your own purposes, so that you can make a new object later and just set
    those values for it.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="So_Why_Do_Some_Modules_Use_Objects?"><a class="permalink" href="#So_Why_Do_Some_Modules_Use_Objects?">So
  Why Do Some Modules Use Objects?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">All these details of using objects are definitely enough to make
    you wonder -- is it worth the bother? If you're a module author, writing
    your module with an object-oriented interface restricts the audience of
    potential users to those who understand the basic concepts of objects and
    object values, as well as Perl's syntax for calling methods. Why complicate
    things by having an object-oriented interface?</p>
<p class="Pp">A somewhat esoteric answer is that a module has an object-oriented
    interface because the module's insides are written in an object-oriented
    style. This article is about the basics of object-oriented
    <i>interfaces</i>, and it'd be going far afield to explain what
    object-oriented <i>design</i> is. But the short story is that
    object-oriented design is just one way of attacking messy problems. It's a
    way that many programmers find very helpful (and which others happen to find
    to be far more of a hassle than it's worth, incidentally), and it just
    happens to show up for you, the module user, as merely the style of
    interface.</p>
<p class="Pp">But a simpler answer is that a functional interface is sometimes a
    hindrance, because it limits the number of things you can do at once --
    limiting it, in fact, to one. For many problems that some modules are meant
    to solve, doing without an object-oriented interface would be like wishing
    that Perl didn't use filehandles. The ideas are rather simpler -- just
    imagine that Perl let you access files, but <i>only</i> one at a time, with
    code like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  open(&quot;foo.txt&quot;) || die &quot;Can't open foo.txt: $!&quot;;
  while(readline) {
    print $_ if /bar/;
  }
  close;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That hypothetical kind of Perl would be simpler, by doing without
    filehandles. But you'd be out of luck if you wanted to read from one file
    while reading from another, or read from two and print to a third.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the same way, a functional FTP module would be fine for just
    uploading files to one server at a time, but it wouldn't allow you to easily
    write programs that make need to use <i>several</i> simultaneous sessions
    (like &quot;look at server A and server B, and if A has a file called X.dat,
    then download it locally and then upload it to server B -- except if B has a
    file called Y.dat, in which case do it the other way around&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">Some kinds of problems that modules solve just lend themselves to
    an object-oriented interface. For those kinds of tasks, a functional
    interface would be more familiar, but less powerful. Learning to use
    object-oriented modules' interfaces does require becoming comfortable with
    the concepts from this article. But in the end it will allow you to use a
    broader range of modules and, with them, to write programs that can do
  more.</p>

<p class="Pp">Sean M. Burke has contributed several modules to CPAN, about half
    of them object-oriented.</p>
<p class="Pp">[The next section should be in a greybox:]</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Gory_Details"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Gory_Details">The
  Gory Details</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">For sake of clarity of explanation, I had to oversimplify some of
    the facts about objects. Here's a few of the gorier details:</p>
<p class="Pp">* Every example I gave of a constructor was a class method. But
    object methods can be constructors, too, if the class was written to work
    that way: <span class="Li">$new</span> =
    <span class="Li">$old</span>-&gt;copy, <span class="Li">$node_y</span> =
    <span class="Li">$node_x</span>-&gt;new_subnode, or the like.</p>
<p class="Pp">* I've given the impression that there's two kinds of methods:
    object methods and class methods. In fact, the same method can be both,
    because it's not the kind of method it is, but the kind of calls it's
    written to accept -- calls that pass an object, or calls that pass a
    class-name.</p>
<p class="Pp">* The term &quot;object value&quot; isn't something you'll find
    used much anywhere else. It's just my shorthand for what would properly be
    called an &quot;object reference&quot; or &quot;reference to a blessed
    item&quot;. In fact, people usually say &quot;object&quot; when they
    properly mean a reference to that object.</p>
<p class="Pp">* I mentioned creating objects with <i>con</i>structors, but I
    didn't mention destroying them with <i>de</i>structor -- a destructor is a
    kind of method that you call to tidy up the object once you're done with it,
    and want it to neatly go away (close connections, delete temporary files,
    free up memory, etc). But because of the way Perl handles memory, most
    modules won't require the user to know about destructors.</p>
<p class="Pp">* I said that class method syntax has to have the class name, as
    in <span class="Li">$session</span> = <b>Net::FTP</b>-&gt;new($host).
    Actually, you can instead use any expression that returns a class name:
    <span class="Li">$ftp_class</span> = 'Net::FTP';
    <span class="Li">$session</span> =
    <b></b><span class="Li"><b>$ftp_class</b></span><b></b>-&gt;new($host).
    Moreover, instead of the method name for object- or class-method calls, you
    can use a scalar holding the method name:
    <span class="Li">$foo</span>-&gt;<b></b><span class="Li"><b>$method</b></span><b></b>($host).
    But, in practice, these syntaxes are rarely useful.</p>
<p class="Pp">And finally, to learn about objects from the perspective of
    writing your own classes, see the
    <span class="Li">&quot;perltoot&quot;</span> documentation, or Damian
    Conway's exhaustive and clear book <i>Object Oriented Perl</i> (Manning
    Publications 1999, ISBN 1-884777-79-1).</p>
