<p class="Pp">Locale::Codes - a distribution of modules to handle locale
  codes</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Locale-Codes</b> is a distribution containing a set of modules.
    The modules each deal with different types of codes which identify parts of
    the locale including languages, countries, currency, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">Currently, the following modules are included:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Locale::Codes::Country,"><a class="permalink" href="#Locale::Codes::Country,"><b>Locale::Codes::Country,
    Locale::Country</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This includes support for country codes (such as those listed in ISO-3166)
      to specify the country.
    <p class="Pp">Because this module was originally distributed as
        Locale::Country, it is also available under that name.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Locale::Codes::Language,"><a class="permalink" href="#Locale::Codes::Language,"><b>Locale::Codes::Language,
    Locale::Language</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This includes support for language codes (such as those listed in ISO-639)
      to specify the language.
    <p class="Pp">Because this module was originally distributed as
        Locale::Language, it is also available under that name.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Locale::Codes::Currency,"><a class="permalink" href="#Locale::Codes::Currency,"><b>Locale::Codes::Currency,
    Locale::Currency</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This includes support for currency codes (such as those listed in
      ISO-4217) to specify the currency.
    <p class="Pp">Because this module was originally distributed as
        Locale::Currency, it is also available under that name.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Locale::Codes::Script,"><a class="permalink" href="#Locale::Codes::Script,"><b>Locale::Codes::Script,
    Locale::Script</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This includes support for script codes (such as those listed in ISO-15924)
      to specify the script.
    <p class="Pp">Because this module was originally distributed as
        Locale::Script, it is also available under that name.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Locale::Codes::LangExt"><a class="permalink" href="#Locale::Codes::LangExt"><b>Locale::Codes::LangExt</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This includes support for language extension codes (such as those listed
      in the IANA language registry) to specify the language extension.</dd>
  <dt id="Locale::Codes::LangVar"><a class="permalink" href="#Locale::Codes::LangVar"><b>Locale::Codes::LangVar</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This includes support for language variation codes (such as those listed
      in the IANA language registry) to specify the language variation.</dd>
  <dt id="Locale::Codes::LangFam"><a class="permalink" href="#Locale::Codes::LangFam"><b>Locale::Codes::LangFam</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This includes support for language family codes (such as those listed in
      ISO 639-5) to specify families of languages.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Each module can support an arbitrary number of code sets, and it
    it not required that the relationship between these code sets be one-to-one.
    For example, the Locale::Codes::Country module supports code sets from
    ISO-3166 and the FIPS 10 standard, and they do not break the world down into
    exactly the same sets of countries. This does not cause any problem (though
    converting codes from ISO-3166 to FIPS or back will not work except for
    countries that are one-to-one).</p>
<p class="Pp">All data in all of these modules comes directly from the original
    standards (or as close to direct as possible), so it should be up-to-date at
    the time of release.</p>
<p class="Pp">I plan on releasing a new version several times a year to
    incorporate any changes made in the standards. However, I don't always know
    about changes that occur, so if any of the standards change, and you want a
    new release sooner, just email me and I'll get one out.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to the modules above, there are a number of support
    modules included in the distribution including:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="Locale::Codes::Constants"><a class="permalink" href="#Locale::Codes::Constants"><b>Locale::Codes::Constants</b></a></dt>

  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">These modules are not intended to be used by programmers. They
    contain functions or data that are used by the modules listed above.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NEW_CODE_SETS"><a class="permalink" href="#NEW_CODE_SETS">NEW
  CODE SETS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">I'm always open to suggestions for new code sets.</p>
<p class="Pp">In order for me to add a code set, I want the following criteria
    to be met:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="General-use"><a class="permalink" href="#General-use"><b>General-use
    code set</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If a code set is not general use, I'm not likely to spend the time to add
      and support it.</dd>
  <dt id="An"><a class="permalink" href="#An"><b>An official source of
    data</b></a></dt>
  <dd>I require an official (or at least, a NEARLY official) source where I can
      get the data on a regular basis.
    <p class="Pp">Ideally, I'd only get data from an official source, but
        sometimes that is not possible. For example the ISO standards are not
        typically available for free, so I may have to get some of that data
        from alternate sources that I'm confident are getting their data from
        the official source. However, I will always be hesitant to accept a
        non-official source.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As an example, I used to get some country data from the CIA
        World Factbook. Given the nature of the source, I'm sure they're
        updating data from the official sources and I consider it
        &quot;nearly&quot; official. However, even in this case, I found that
        they were adding codes that were not part of the standard, so I have
        stopped using them as a source.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There are many 3rd party sites which maintain lists (many of
        which are actually in a more convenient form than the official sites).
        Unfortunately, I will reject most of them since I have no feel for how
        &quot;official&quot; they are.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="A"><a class="permalink" href="#A"><b>A free source of the
    data</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Obviously, the data must be free-of-charge. I'm not interested in paying
      for the data (and I'm not interested in the overhead of having someone
      else pay for the data for me).</dd>
  <dt id="A~2"><a class="permalink" href="#A~2"><b>A reliable source of
    data</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The source of data must come from a source that I can reasonably expect to
      exist for the foreseeable future since I will be extremely reluctant to
      drop support for a data set once it's included.
    <p class="Pp">I am also reluctant to accept data sent to me by an
        individual. Although I appreciate the offer, it is simply not practical
        to consider an individual contribution as a reliable source of data. The
        source should be an official agency of some sort.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">These requirements are open to discussion. If you have a code set
    you'd like to see added, but which may not meet all of the above
    requirements, feel free to email me and we'll discuss it. Depending on
    circumstances, I may be willing to waive some of these criteria.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMON_ALIASES"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMON_ALIASES">COMMON
  ALIASES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">As of version 2.00, the modules supported common variants of
    names.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, Locale::Country supports variant names for countries,
    and a few of the most common ones are included in the data. The country code
    for &quot;United States&quot; is &quot;us&quot;, so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   country2code('United States');
      =&gt; &quot;us&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now the following will also return 'us':</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   country2code('United States of America');
   country2code('USA');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Any number of common aliases may be included in the data, in
    addition to the names that come directly from the standards. If you have a
    common alias for a country, language, or any other of the types of codes,
    let me know and I'll add it, with some restrictions.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the country name &quot;North Korea&quot; never
    appeared in any of the official sources (instead, it was &quot;Korea,
    North&quot; or &quot;Korea, Democratic People's Republic of&quot;. I would
    honor a request to add an alias &quot;North Korea&quot; since that's a very
    common way to specify the country (please don't request this... I've already
    added it).</p>
<p class="Pp">On the other hand, a request to add Zaire as an alias for
    &quot;Congo, The Democratic Republic of&quot; will not be honored. The
    country's official name is no longer Zaire, so adding it as an alias
    violates the standard. Zaire was kept as an alias in versions prior to 3.00,
    but it has been removed. Other aliases (if any) which no longer appear in
    any standard (and which are not common variations of the name in the
    standards) have also been removed.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DEPRECATED_CODES"><a class="permalink" href="#DEPRECATED_CODES">DEPRECATED
  CODES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Occasionally, a code is deprecated, but it may still be desirable
    to have access to it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Although there is no way to see every code that has ever existed
    and been deprecated (since most codesets do not have that information
    available), as of version 3.20, every code which has ever been included in
    these modules can be referenced.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more information, refer to the documentation on the code2XXX,
    XXX2code, all_XXX_codes, and all_XXX_names function in the
    <b>Locale::Codes::API</b> documentation.</p>
