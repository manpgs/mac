<h2 class="Ss" id="Nuts_and_bolts_of_testing."><a class="permalink" href="#Nuts_and_bolts_of_testing.">Nuts
  and bolts of testing.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Here's the most basic test program.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    print &quot;1..1\n&quot;;

    print 1 + 1 == 2 ? &quot;ok 1\n&quot; : &quot;not ok 1\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Because 1 + 1 is 2, it prints:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    1..1
    ok 1
</pre>
<p class="Pp">What this says is: <span class="Li">1..1</span> &quot;I'm going to
    run one test.&quot; [1] <span class="Li">&quot;ok 1&quot;</span> &quot;The
    first test passed&quot;. And that's about all magic there is to testing.
    Your basic unit of testing is the <i>ok</i>. For each thing you test, an
    <span class="Li">&quot;ok&quot;</span> is printed. Simple. Test::Harness
    interprets your test results to determine if you succeeded or failed (more
    on that later).</p>
<p class="Pp">Writing all these print statements rapidly gets tedious.
    Fortunately, there's Test::Simple. It has one function,
    <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 1;

    ok( 1 + 1 == 2 );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That does the same thing as the previous code.
    <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span> is the backbone of Perl testing,
    and we'll be using it instead of roll-your-own from here on. If
    <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span> gets a true value, the test passes.
    False, it fails.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 2;
    ok( 1 + 1 == 2 );
    ok( 2 + 2 == 5 );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">From that comes:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    1..2
    ok 1
    not ok 2
    #     Failed test (test.pl at line 5)
    # Looks like you failed 1 tests of 2.
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">1..2</span> &quot;I'm going to run two
    tests.&quot; This number is a <i>plan</i>. It helps to ensure your test
    program ran all the way through and didn't die or skip some tests.
    <span class="Li">&quot;ok 1&quot;</span> &quot;The first test passed.&quot;
    <span class="Li">&quot;not ok 2&quot;</span> &quot;The second test
    failed&quot;. Test::Simple helpfully prints out some extra commentary about
    your tests.</p>
<p class="Pp">It's not scary. Come, hold my hand. We're going to give an example
    of testing a module. For our example, we'll be testing a date library,
    Date::ICal. It's on CPAN, so download a copy and follow along. [2]</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Where_to_start?"><a class="permalink" href="#Where_to_start?">Where
  to start?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This is the hardest part of testing, where do you start? People
    often get overwhelmed at the apparent enormity of the task of testing a
    whole module. The best place to start is at the beginning. Date::ICal is an
    object-oriented module, and that means you start by making an object. Test
    <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    # assume these two lines are in all subsequent examples
    use strict;
    use warnings;

    use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 2;

    use Date::ICal;

    my $ical = Date::ICal-&gt;new;         # create an object
    ok( defined $ical );                # check that we got something
    ok( $ical-&gt;isa('Date::ICal') );     # and it's the right class
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Run that and you should get:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    1..2
    ok 1
    ok 2
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Congratulations! You've written your first useful test.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Names"><a class="permalink" href="#Names">Names</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">That output isn't terribly descriptive, is it? When you have two
    tests you can figure out which one is #2, but what if you have 102
  tests?</p>
<p class="Pp">Each test can be given a little descriptive name as the second
    argument to <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 2;

    ok( defined $ical,              'new() returned something' );
    ok( $ical-&gt;isa('Date::ICal'),   &quot;  and it's the right class&quot; );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now you'll see:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    1..2
    ok 1 - new() returned something
    ok 2 -   and it's the right class

<h2 class="Ss" id="Test_the_manual"><a class="permalink" href="#Test_the_manual">Test

<p class="Pp">The simplest way to build up a decent testing suite is to just
    test what the manual says it does. [3] Let's pull something out of the
    &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot; in Date::ICal and test that all its bits work.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    use Test::Simple tests =&gt; 8;

    use Date::ICal;

    $ical = Date::ICal-&gt;new( year =&gt; 1964, month =&gt; 10, day =&gt; 16,
                             hour =&gt; 16,   min   =&gt; 12, sec =&gt; 47,
                             tz   =&gt; '0530' );

    ok( defined $ical,            'new() returned something' );
    ok( $ical-&gt;isa('Date::ICal'), &quot;  and it's the right class&quot; );
    ok( $ical-&gt;sec   == 47,       '  sec()'   );
    ok( $ical-&gt;min   == 12,       '  min()'   );
    ok( $ical-&gt;hour  == 16,       '  hour()'  );
    ok( $ical-&gt;day   == 17,       '  day()'   );
    ok( $ical-&gt;month == 10,       '  month()' );
    ok( $ical-&gt;year  == 1964,     '  year()'  );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Run that and you get:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    1..8
    ok 1 - new() returned something
    ok 2 -   and it's the right class
    ok 3 -   sec()
    ok 4 -   min()
    ok 5 -   hour()
    not ok 6 -   day()
    #     Failed test (- at line 16)
    ok 7 -   month()
    ok 8 -   year()
    # Looks like you failed 1 tests of 8.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Whoops, a failure! [4] Test::Simple helpfully lets us know on what
    line the failure occurred, but not much else. We were supposed to get 17,
    but we didn't. What did we get?? Dunno. You could re-run the test in the
    debugger or throw in some print statements to find out.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead, switch from Test::Simple to Test::More. Test::More does
    everything Test::Simple does, and more! In fact, Test::More does things
    <i>exactly</i> the way Test::Simple does. You can literally swap
    Test::Simple out and put Test::More in its place. That's just what we're
    going to do.</p>
<p class="Pp">Test::More does more than Test::Simple. The most important
    difference at this point is it provides more informative ways to say
    &quot;ok&quot;. Although you can write almost any test with a generic
    <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span>, it can't tell you what went wrong.
    The <span class="Li">&quot;is()&quot;</span> function lets us declare that
    something is supposed to be the same as something else:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Test::More tests =&gt; 8;

    use Date::ICal;

    $ical = Date::ICal-&gt;new( year =&gt; 1964, month =&gt; 10, day =&gt; 16,
                             hour =&gt; 16,   min   =&gt; 12, sec =&gt; 47,
                             tz   =&gt; '0530' );

    ok( defined $ical,            'new() returned something' );
    ok( $ical-&gt;isa('Date::ICal'), &quot;  and it's the right class&quot; );
    is( $ical-&gt;sec,     47,       '  sec()'   );
    is( $ical-&gt;min,     12,       '  min()'   );
    is( $ical-&gt;hour,    16,       '  hour()'  );
    is( $ical-&gt;day,     17,       '  day()'   );
    is( $ical-&gt;month,   10,       '  month()' );
    is( $ical-&gt;year,    1964,     '  year()'  );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">&quot;Is <span class="Li">&quot;$ical-&gt;sec&quot;</span>
    47?&quot; &quot;Is <span class="Li">&quot;$ical-&gt;min&quot;</span>
    12?&quot; With <span class="Li">&quot;is()&quot;</span> in place, you get
    more information:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    1..8
    ok 1 - new() returned something
    ok 2 -   and it's the right class
    ok 3 -   sec()
    ok 4 -   min()
    ok 5 -   hour()
    not ok 6 -   day()
    #     Failed test (- at line 16)
    #          got: '16'
    #     expected: '17'
    ok 7 -   month()
    ok 8 -   year()
    # Looks like you failed 1 tests of 8.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Aha. <span class="Li">&quot;$ical-&gt;day&quot;</span> returned
    16, but we expected 17. A quick check shows that the code is working fine,
    we made a mistake when writing the tests. Change it to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    is( $ical-&gt;day,     16,       '  day()'   );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">... and everything works.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any time you're doing a &quot;this equals that&quot; sort of test,
    use <span class="Li">&quot;is()&quot;</span>. It even works on arrays. The
    test is always in scalar context, so you can test how many elements are in
    an array this way. [5]</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

    is( @foo, 5, 'foo has 5 elements' );

<h2 class="Ss" id="Sometimes_the_tests_are_wrong"><a class="permalink" href="#Sometimes_the_tests_are_wrong">Sometimes
  the tests are wrong</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This brings up a very important lesson. Code has bugs. Tests are
    code. Ergo, tests have bugs. A failing test could mean a bug in the code,
    but don't discount the possibility that the test is wrong.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the flip side, don't be tempted to prematurely declare a test
    incorrect just because you're having trouble finding the bug. Invalidating a
    test isn't something to be taken lightly, and don't use it as a cop out to
    avoid work.</p>

    leap years right? We could keep repeating the code above, or we could set up
    a little try/expect loop.</p>

<p class="Pp">Now we can test bunches of dates by just adding them to

    more dates, you'll be inclined to just throw more in as you think of them.
    Only problem is, every time we add to that we have to keep adjusting the
    <span class="Li">&quot;use Test::More tests =&gt; ##&quot;</span> line. That
    can rapidly get annoying. There are ways to make this work better.</p>

    plan tests =&gt; keys(%ICal_Dates) * 8;

    ...and then your tests...
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To be even more flexible, use
    <span class="Li">&quot;done_testing&quot;</span>. This means we're just
    running some tests, don't know how many. [6]</p>

<pre>
    use Test::More;   # instead of tests =&gt; 32

    ... # tests here

    done_testing();   # reached the end safely
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you don't specify a plan, Test::More expects to see
    <span class="Li">&quot;done_testing()&quot;</span> before your program
    exits. It will warn you if you forget it. You can give
    <span class="Li">&quot;done_testing()&quot;</span> an optional number of
    tests you expected to run, and if the number ran differs, Test::More will
    give you another kind of warning.</p>

    Test::Harness that the tests have been skipped.</p>

<p class="Pp">This means your tests won't fail on MacOS. This means fewer emails
    from MacPerl users telling you about failing tests that you know will never
    work. You've got to be careful with skip tests. These are for tests which
    don't work and <i>never will</i>. It is not for skipping genuine bugs (we'll
    get to that in a moment).</p>
<p class="Pp">The tests are wholly and completely skipped. [10] This will
  work.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

  tests</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">While thumbing through the Date::ICal man page, I came across
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   ical

       $ical_string = $ical-&gt;ical;

   Retrieves, or sets, the date on the object, using any
   valid ICal date/time string.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">&quot;Retrieves or sets&quot;. Hmmm. I didn't see a test for using
    <span class="Li">&quot;ical()&quot;</span> to set the date in the Date::ICal
    test suite. So I wrote one:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Test::More tests =&gt; 1;
    use Date::ICal;

    my $ical = Date::ICal-&gt;new;
    $ical-&gt;ical('20201231Z');
    is( $ical-&gt;ical, '20201231Z',   'Setting via ical()' );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Run that. I saw:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    1..1
    not ok 1 - Setting via ical()
    #     Failed test (- at line 6)
    #          got: '20010814T233649Z'
    #     expected: '20201231Z'
    # Looks like you failed 1 tests of 1.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Whoops! Looks like it's unimplemented. Assume you don't have the
    time to fix this. [11] Normally, you'd just comment out the test and put a
    note in a todo list somewhere. Instead, explicitly state &quot;this test
    will fail&quot; by wrapping it in a <span class="Li">&quot;TODO&quot;</span>
    block:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Test::More tests =&gt; 1;

    TODO: {
        local $TODO = 'ical($ical) not yet implemented';

        my $ical = Date::ICal-&gt;new;
        $ical-&gt;ical('20201231Z');

        is( $ical-&gt;ical, '20201231Z',   'Setting via ical()' );
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now when you run, it's a little different:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    1..1
    not ok 1 - Setting via ical() # TODO ical($ical) not yet implemented
    #          got: '20010822T201551Z'
    #     expected: '20201231Z'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Test::More doesn't say &quot;Looks like you failed 1 tests of
    1&quot;. That '# TODO' tells Test::Harness &quot;this is supposed to
    fail&quot; and it treats a failure as a successful test. You can write tests
    even before you've fixed the underlying code.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a TODO test passes, Test::Harness will report it
    &quot;UNEXPECTEDLY SUCCEEDED&quot;. When that happens, remove the TODO block
    with <span class="Li">&quot;local $TODO&quot;</span> and turn it into a real
    test.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Testing_with_taint_mode."><a class="permalink" href="#Testing_with_taint_mode.">Testing
  with taint mode.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Taint mode is a funny thing. It's the globalest of all global
    features. Once you turn it on, it affects <i>all</i> code in your program
    and <i>all</i> modules used (and all the modules they use). If a single
    piece of code isn't taint clean, the whole thing explodes. With that in
    mind, it's very important to ensure your module works under taint mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">It's very simple to have your tests run under taint mode. Just
    throw a <span class="Li">&quot;-T&quot;</span> into the
    <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line. Test::Harness will read the
    switches in <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> and use them to run your
    tests.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -Tw

    ...test normally here...
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When you say <span class="Li">&quot;make test&quot;</span> it will
    run with taint mode on.</p>

  <dd>But what happens if your test program dies halfway through?! Since we
      didn't say how many tests we're going to run, how can we know it failed?
      No problem, Test::More employs some magic to catch that death and turn the

  <dd>Most Operating Systems record time as the number of seconds since a

  <dd>MacOS's epoch is midnight January 1st, 1904. VMS's is midnight, November
      17th, 1858, but vmsperl emulates the Unix epoch so it's not a
    problem.</dd>
