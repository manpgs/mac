<pre>  % cpanm Type::Tiny

<p class="Pp">If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need
    to pass the &quot;-S&quot; flag to cpanm, which uses sudo to install the
    module:</p>

<pre>  % cpanm -S Type::Tiny

<p class="Pp">As a last resort, you can manually install it. Download the
    tarball and unpack it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Consult the file META.json for a list of pre-requisites. Install
    these first.</p>
<p class="Pp">To build Type-Tiny:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  % perl Makefile.PL
  % make &amp;&amp; make test
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Then install it:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  % make install
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need
    to run:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<p class="Pp">Type::Tiny requires at least Perl 5.6.1, though certain
    Unicode-related features (e.g. non-ASCII type constraint names) may work
    better in newer versions of Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Type::Tiny requires Exporter::Tiny, a module that was previously
    bundled in this distribution, but has since been spun off as a separate
    distribution. Don't worry - it's quick and easy to install.</p>
<p class="Pp">At run-time, Type::Tiny also requires the following modules: B,
    B::Deparse, Carp, Data::Dumper, Scalar::Util, Text::Balanced, overload,
    strict and warnings. All of these come bundled with Perl itself. Prior to
    Perl 5.8, Scalar::Util and Text::Balanced do not come bundled with Perl and
    will need installing separately from the CPAN.</p>
<p class="Pp">Certain features require additional modules. Tying a variable to a
    type constraint (e.g. <span class="Li">&quot;tie my $count,
    Int&quot;</span>) requires Type::Tie; stack traces on exceptions require
    Devel::StackTrace. The Reply::Plugin::TypeTiny plugin for Reply requires
    Reply (obviously). Devel::LexAlias may <i>slightly</i> increase the speed of
    some of Type::Tiny's compiled coderefs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Type::Tiny::XS is not required, but if available provides a speed
    boost for some type checks. (Setting the environment variable
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_TYPE_TINY_XS&quot;</span> to false, or setting
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_ONLY&quot;</span> to true will suppress the use
    of Type::Tiny::XS, even if it is available.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The test suite additionally requires Test::More, Test::Fatal and
    Test::Requires. Test::More comes bundled with Perl, but if you are using a
    version of Perl older than 5.14, you will need to upgrade to at least
    Test::More version 0.96. Test::Requires and Test::Fatal (plus Try::Tiny
    which Test::Fatal depends on) are bundled with Type::Tiny in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> directory, so you do not need to
    install them separately.</p>
<p class="Pp">If using Type::Tiny in conjunction with Moo, then at least Moo
    1.006000 is recommended. If using Type::Tiny with Moose, then at least Moose
    2.0000 is recommended. If using Type::Tiny with Mouse, then at least Mouse
    1.00 is recommended. Type::Tiny is mostly untested against older versions of
    these packages.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Type::Tiny and cperl</i></p>
<p class="Pp">cperl &lt;http://perl11.org/cperl/&gt; is an extended version of
    Perl with various incompatible changes from the official Perl 5
  releases.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of Type::Tiny 1.010001, cperl is a supported platform for
    Type::Tiny with some caveats. At the time of writing, Moose will not install
    on the latest cperl releases, so using Type::Tiny with Moose on cperl is
    untested. Moo can be forced to install, and Type::Tiny is verified to work
    with Moo on cperl. cperl not only enables a new warnings category called
    &quot;shadow&quot; (which is good; they're potentially useful) but switches
    on shadow warnings by default (which is annoying). Type::Tiny does not (and
    likely will never) attempt to work around these warnings. If the warnings
    bother you, you should be able to catch them using
    <span class="Li">$SIG{__WARN__}</span>. Certain features of Eval::TypeTiny
    are broken under cperl, but they're not thought to have any practical effect
    on Type::Tiny or its other bundled modules.</p>
