<p class="Pp">This pragma allows overloading of Perl's operators for a class. To

    in perlsub instead.</p>

<p class="Pp"><i>Declaration</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Arguments of the <span class="Li">&quot;use overload&quot;</span>
    directive are (key, value) pairs. For the full set of legal keys, see
    &quot;Overloadable Operations&quot; below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Operator implementations (the values) can be subroutines,
    references to subroutines, or anonymous subroutines - in other words,
    anything legal inside a <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;{ ... }&quot;</span>
    call. Values specified as strings are interpreted as method names. Thus</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    package Number;
    use overload
        &quot;-&quot; =&gt; &quot;minus&quot;,
        &quot;*=&quot; =&gt; \&amp;muas,
        '&quot;&quot;' =&gt; sub { ...; };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">declares that subtraction is to be implemented by method
    <span class="Li">&quot;minus()&quot;</span> in the class
    <span class="Li">&quot;Number&quot;</span> (or one of its base classes), and
    that the function <span class="Li">&quot;Number::muas()&quot;</span> is to
    be used for the assignment form of multiplication,
    <span class="Li">&quot;*=&quot;</span>. It also defines an anonymous
    subroutine to implement stringification: this is called whenever an object
    blessed into the package <span class="Li">&quot;Number&quot;</span> is used
    in a string context (this subroutine might, for example, return the number
    as a Roman numeral).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Calling Conventions and Magic Autogeneration</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The following sample implementation of
    <span class="Li">&quot;minus()&quot;</span> (which assumes that
    <span class="Li">&quot;Number&quot;</span> objects are simply blessed
    references to scalars) illustrates the calling conventions:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    package Number;
    sub minus {
        my ($self, $other, $swap) = @_;
        my $result = $$self - $other;         # *
        $result = -$result if $swap;
        ref $result ? $result : bless \$result;
    }
    # * may recurse once - see table below
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Three arguments are passed to all subroutines specified in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;use overload&quot;</span> directive (with exceptions
    - see below, particularly &quot;nomethod&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">The first of these is the operand providing the overloaded
    operator implementation - in this case, the object whose
    <span class="Li">&quot;minus()&quot;</span> method is being called.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second argument is the other operand, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> in the case of a unary
  operator.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third argument is set to TRUE if (and only if) the two
    operands have been swapped. Perl may do this to ensure that the first
    argument (<span class="Li">$self</span>) is an object implementing the
    overloaded operation, in line with general object calling conventions. For
    example, if <span class="Li">$x</span> and <span class="Li">$y</span> are
    <span class="Li">&quot;Number&quot;</span>s:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    operation   |   generates a call to
    ============|======================
    $x - $y     |   minus($x, $y, '')
    $x - 7      |   minus($x, 7, '')
    7 - $x      |   minus($x, 7, 1)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Perl may also use <span class="Li">&quot;minus()&quot;</span> to
    implement other operators which have not been specified in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;use overload&quot;</span> directive, according to the
    rules for &quot;Magic Autogeneration&quot; described later. For example, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;use overload&quot;</span> above declared no
    subroutine for any of the operators <span class="Li">&quot;--&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;neg&quot;</span> (the overload key for unary minus),
    or <span class="Li">&quot;-=&quot;</span>. Thus</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    operation   |   generates a call to
    ============|======================
    -$x         |   minus($x, 0, 1)
    $x--        |   minus($x, 1, undef)
    $x -= 3     |   minus($x, 3, undef)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note the <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>s: where
    autogeneration results in the method for a standard operator which does not
    change either of its operands, such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span>, being used to implement an operator
    which changes the operand (&quot;mutators&quot;: here,
    <span class="Li">&quot;--&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;-=&quot;</span>), Perl passes undef as the third
    argument. This still evaluates as FALSE, consistent with the fact that the
    operands have not been swapped, but gives the subroutine a chance to alter
    its behaviour in these cases.</p>
<p class="Pp">In all the above examples,
    <span class="Li">&quot;minus()&quot;</span> is required only to return the
    result of the subtraction: Perl takes care of the assignment to
    <span class="Li">$x</span>. In fact, such methods should <i>not</i> modify
    their operands, even if <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> is passed
    as the third argument (see &quot;Overloadable Operations&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">The same is not true of implementations of
    <span class="Li">&quot;++&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;--&quot;</span>: these are expected to modify their
    operand. An appropriate implementation of
    <span class="Li">&quot;--&quot;</span> might look like</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use overload '--' =&gt; &quot;decr&quot;,
        # ...
    sub decr { --${$_[0]}; }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the &quot;bitwise&quot; feature is enabled (see feature), a
    fifth TRUE argument is passed to subroutines handling
    <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span>
    and <span class="Li">&quot;~&quot;</span>. This indicates that the caller is
    expecting numeric behaviour. The fourth argument will be
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>, as that position
    (<span class="Li">$_[3]</span>) is reserved for use by
  &quot;nomethod&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Mathemagic, Mutators, and Copy Constructors</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The term 'mathemagic' describes the overloaded implementation of
    mathematical operators. Mathemagical operations raise an issue. Consider the
    code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $a = $b;
    --$a;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">$a</span> and <span class="Li">$b</span> are
    scalars then after these statements</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $a == $b - 1
</pre>
<p class="Pp">An object, however, is a reference to blessed data, so if
    <span class="Li">$a</span> and <span class="Li">$b</span> are objects then
    the assignment <span class="Li">&quot;$a = $b&quot;</span> copies only the
    reference, leaving <span class="Li">$a</span> and <span class="Li">$b</span>
    referring to the same object data. One might therefore expect the operation
    <span class="Li">&quot;--$a&quot;</span> to decrement
    <span class="Li">$b</span> as well as <span class="Li">$a</span>. However,
    this would not be consistent with how we expect the mathematical operators
    to work.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl resolves this dilemma by transparently calling a copy
    constructor before calling a method defined to implement a mutator
    (<span class="Li">&quot;--&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;+=&quot;</span>, and so on.). In the above example,
    when Perl reaches the decrement statement, it makes a copy of the object
    data in <span class="Li">$a</span> and assigns to <span class="Li">$a</span>
    a reference to the copied data. Only then does it call
    <span class="Li">&quot;decr()&quot;</span>, which alters the copied data,
    leaving <span class="Li">$b</span> unchanged. Thus the object metaphor is
    preserved as far as possible, while mathemagical operations still work
    according to the arithmetic metaphor.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: the preceding paragraph describes what happens when Perl
    autogenerates the copy constructor for an object based on a scalar. For
    other cases, see &quot;Copy Constructor&quot;.</p>

    separated by spaces, in the values of the hash
    <span class="Li">%overload::ops</span>:</p>

</pre>
<p class="Pp">Most of the overloadable operators map one-to-one to these keys.
    Exceptions, including additional overloadable operations not apparent from
    this hash, are included in the notes which follow. This list is subject to
    growth over time.</p>
<p class="Pp">A warning is issued if an attempt is made to register an operator
    not found above.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;not&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">The operator <span class="Li">&quot;not&quot;</span> is not a
        valid key for <span class="Li">&quot;use overload&quot;</span>. However,
        if the operator <span class="Li">&quot;!&quot;</span> is overloaded then
        the same implementation will be used for
        <span class="Li">&quot;not&quot;</span> (since the two operators differ
        only in precedence).</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;neg&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">The key <span class="Li">&quot;neg&quot;</span> is used for
        unary minus to disambiguate it from binary
        <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;++&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;--&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">Assuming they are to behave analogously to Perl's
        <span class="Li">&quot;++&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;--&quot;</span>, overloaded implementations of
        these operators are required to mutate their operands.</p>
    <p class="Pp">No distinction is made between prefix and postfix forms of the
        increment and decrement operators: these differ only in the point at
        which Perl calls the associated subroutine when evaluating an
        expression.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>Assignments</i>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    +=  -=  *=  /=  %=  **=  &lt;&lt;=  &gt;&gt;=  x=  .=
    &amp;=  |=  ^=  &amp;.=  |.=  ^.=
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Simple assignment is not overloadable (the
        <span class="Li">'='</span> key is used for the &quot;Copy
        Constructor&quot;). Perl does have a way to make assignments to an
        object do whatever you want, but this involves using <b>tie()</b>, not
        overload - see &quot;tie&quot; in perlfunc and the &quot;COOKBOOK&quot;
        examples below.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The subroutine for the assignment variant of an operator is
        required only to return the result of the operation. It is permitted to
        change the value of its operand (this is safe because Perl calls the
        copy constructor first), but this is optional since Perl assigns the
        returned value to the left-hand operand anyway.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An object that overloads an assignment operator does so only
        in respect of assignments to that object. In other words, Perl never
        calls the corresponding methods with the third argument (the
        &quot;swap&quot; argument) set to TRUE. For example, the operation</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $a *= $b
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">cannot lead to <span class="Li">$b</span>'s implementation of
        <span class="Li">&quot;*=&quot;</span> being called, even if
        <span class="Li">$a</span> is a scalar. (It can, however, generate a
        call to <span class="Li">$b</span>'s method for
        <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>).</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>Non-mutators with a mutator variant</i>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>     +  -  *  /  %  **  &lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;  x  .
     &amp;  |  ^  &amp;.  |.  ^.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">As described above, Perl may call methods for operators like
        <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span> in the course of implementing
        missing operations like <span class="Li">&quot;++&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;+=&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;=&quot;</span>. While these methods may
        detect this usage by testing the definedness of the third argument, they
        should in all cases avoid changing their operands. This is because Perl
        does not call the copy constructor before invoking these methods.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;int&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">Traditionally, the Perl function
        <span class="Li">&quot;int&quot;</span> rounds to 0 (see &quot;int&quot;
        in perlfunc), and so for floating-point-like types one should follow the
        same semantic.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>String, numeric, boolean, and regexp conversions</i>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    &quot;&quot;  0+  bool
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">These conversions are invoked according to context as
        necessary. For example, the subroutine for
        <span class="Li">'&quot;&quot;'</span> (stringify) may be used where the
        overloaded object is passed as an argument to
        <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span>, and that for
        <span class="Li">'bool'</span> where it is tested in the condition of a
        flow control statement (like <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span>)
        or the ternary <span class="Li">&quot;?:&quot;</span> operation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Of course, in contexts like, for example,
        <span class="Li">&quot;$obj + 1&quot;</span>, Perl will invoke
        <span class="Li">$obj</span>'s implementation of
        <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span> rather than (in this example)
        converting <span class="Li">$obj</span> to a number using the numify
        method <span class="Li">'0+'</span> (an exception to this is when no
        method has been provided for <span class="Li">'+'</span> and
        &quot;fallback&quot; is set to TRUE).</p>
    <p class="Pp">The subroutines for <span class="Li">'&quot;&quot;'</span>,
        <span class="Li">'0+'</span>, and <span class="Li">'bool'</span> can
        return any arbitrary Perl value. If the corresponding operation for this
        value is overloaded too, the operation will be called again with this
        value.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As a special case if the overload returns the object itself
        then it will be used directly. An overloaded conversion returning the
        object is probably a bug, because you're likely to get something that
        looks like
        <span class="Li">&quot;YourPackage=HASH(0x8172b34)&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    qr
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The subroutine for <span class="Li">'qr'</span> is used
        wherever the object is interpolated into or used as a regexp, including
        when it appears on the RHS of a <span class="Li">&quot;=~&quot;</span>
        or <span class="Li">&quot;!~&quot;</span> operator.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;qr&quot;</span> must return a compiled
        regexp, or a ref to a compiled regexp (such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span> returns), and any further
        overloading on the return value will be ignored.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>Iteration</i>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> is overloaded
        then the same implementation is used for both the <i>read-filehandle</i>
        syntax <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;$var&gt;&quot;</span> and
        <i>globbing</i> syntax
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;${var}&gt;&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>File tests</i>
    <p class="Pp">The key <span class="Li">'-X'</span> is used to specify a
        subroutine to handle all the filetest operators
        (<span class="Li">&quot;-f&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;-x&quot;</span>, and so on: see &quot;-X&quot; in
        perlfunc for the full list); it is not possible to overload any filetest
        operator individually. To distinguish them, the letter following the '-'
        is passed as the second argument (that is, in the slot that for binary
        operators is used to pass the second operand).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Calling an overloaded filetest operator does not affect the
        stat value associated with the special filehandle
        <span class="Li">&quot;_&quot;</span>. It still refers to the result of
        the last <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;lstat&quot;</span> or unoverloaded filetest.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This overload was introduced in Perl 5.12.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>Matching</i>
    <p class="Pp">The key <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> allows you to
        override the smart matching logic used by the
        <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> operator and the switch construct
        (<span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span>).
        See &quot;Switch Statements&quot; in perlsyn and feature.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unusually, the overloaded implementation of the smart match
        operator does not get full control of the smart match behaviour. In
        particular, in the following code:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    package Foo;
    use overload '~~' =&gt; 'match';
    my $obj =  Foo-&gt;new();
    $obj ~~ [ 1,2,3 ];
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">the smart match does <i>not</i> invoke the method call like
        this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $obj-&gt;match([1,2,3],0);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">rather, the smart match distributive rule takes precedence, so
        <span class="Li">$obj</span> is smart matched against each array element
        in turn until a match is found, so you may see between one and three of
        these calls instead:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $obj-&gt;match(1,0);
    $obj-&gt;match(2,0);
    $obj-&gt;match(3,0);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Consult the match table in &quot;Smartmatch Operator&quot; in
        perlop for details of when overloading is invoked.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>Dereferencing</i>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    ${}  @{}  %{}  &amp;{}  *{}
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If these operators are not explicitly overloaded then they
        work in the normal way, yielding the underlying scalar, array, or
        whatever stores the object data (or the appropriate error message if the
        dereference operator doesn't match it). Defining a catch-all
        <span class="Li">'nomethod'</span> (see below) makes no difference to
        this as the catch-all function will not be called to implement a missing
        dereference operator.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a dereference operator is overloaded then it must return a
        <i>reference</i> of the appropriate type (for example, the subroutine
        for key <span class="Li">'${}'</span> should return a reference to a
        scalar, not a scalar), or another object which overloads the operator:
        that is, the subroutine only determines what is dereferenced and the
        actual dereferencing is left to Perl. As a special case, if the
        subroutine returns the object itself then it will not be called again -
        avoiding infinite recursion.</p>

<p class="Pp">If a method for an operation is not found then Perl tries to
    autogenerate a substitute implementation from the operations that have been
    defined.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: the behaviour described in this section can be disabled by

<p class="Pp">In the following tables, numbers indicate priority. For example,
    the table below states that, if no implementation for
    <span class="Li">'!'</span> has been defined then Perl will implement it
    using <span class="Li">'bool'</span> (that is, by inverting the value
    returned by the method for <span class="Li">'bool'</span>); if boolean
    conversion is also unimplemented then Perl will use
    <span class="Li">'0+'</span> or, failing that,

<p class="Pp">Just as numeric comparisons can be autogenerated from the method

<p class="Pp">Note also that the copy constructor (key
    <span class="Li">'='</span>) may be autogenerated, but only for objects
    based on scalars. See &quot;Copy Constructor&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Minimal Set of Overloaded Operations</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Since some operations can be automatically generated from others,
    there is a minimal set of operations that need to be overloaded in order to
    have the complete set of overloaded operations at one's disposal. Of course,
    the autogenerated operations may not do exactly what the user expects. The
    minimal set is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    + - * / % ** &lt;&lt; &gt;&gt; x
    &lt;=&gt; cmp
    &amp; | ^ ~ &amp;. |. ^. ~.
    atan2 cos sin exp log sqrt int
    &quot;&quot; 0+ bool
    ~~
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Of the conversions, only one of string, boolean or numeric is
    needed because each can be generated from either of the other two.</p>

<p class="Pp"><i></i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;nomethod&quot;</i></span><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">'nomethod'</span> key is used to specify a
    catch-all function to be called for any operator that is not individually
    overloaded. The specified function will be passed four parameters. The first
    three arguments coincide with those that would have been passed to the
    corresponding method if it had been defined. The fourth argument is the
    <span class="Li">&quot;use overload&quot;</span> key for that missing
    method. If the &quot;bitwise&quot; feature is enabled (see feature), a fifth
    TRUE argument is passed to subroutines handling

<p class="Pp">For example, if <span class="Li">$a</span> is an object blessed

    <p class="Pp">The same as for <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>, but
        if a missing operator cannot be autogenerated then, instead of issuing
        an error message, Perl is allowed to revert to what it would have done
        for that operator if there had been no <span class="Li">&quot;use

<p class="Pp">See &quot;How Perl Chooses an Operator Implementation&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Copy Constructor</i></p>
<p class="Pp">As mentioned above, this operation is called when a mutator is
    applied to a reference that shares its object with some other reference. For
    example, if <span class="Li">$b</span> is mathemagical, and
    <span class="Li">'++'</span> is overloaded with
    <span class="Li">'incr'</span>, and <span class="Li">'='</span> is
    overloaded with <span class="Li">'clone'</span>, then the code</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $a = $b;
    # ... (other code which does not modify $a or $b) ...
    ++$b;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">would be executed in a manner equivalent to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $a = $b;
    # ...
    $b = $b-&gt;clone(undef, &quot;&quot;);
    $b-&gt;incr(undef, &quot;&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The subroutine for <span class="Li">'='</span> does not overload the Perl
      assignment operator: it is used only to allow mutators to work as
      described here. (See &quot;Assignments&quot; above.)</li>
  <li>As for other operations, the subroutine implementing '=' is passed three
      arguments, though the last two are always
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">''</span>.</li>
  <li>The copy constructor is called only before a call to a function declared
      to implement a mutator, for example, if
      <span class="Li">&quot;++$b;&quot;</span> in the code above is effected
      via a method declared for key <span class="Li">'++'</span> (or 'nomethod',
      passed <span class="Li">'++'</span> as the fourth argument) or, by
      autogeneration, <span class="Li">'+='</span>. It is not called if the
      increment operation is effected by a call to the method for
      <span class="Li">'+'</span> since, in the equivalent code,
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $a = $b;
    $b = $b + 1;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">the data referred to by <span class="Li">$a</span> is
        unchanged by the assignment to <span class="Li">$b</span> of a reference
        to new object data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The copy constructor is not called if Perl determines that it is
      unnecessary because there is no other reference to the data being
      modified.</li>
  <li>If <span class="Li">'fallback'</span> is undefined or TRUE then a copy
      constructor can be autogenerated, but only for objects based on scalars.
      In other cases it needs to be defined explicitly. Where an object's data
      is stored as, for example, an array of scalars, the following might be
      appropriate:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use overload '=' =&gt; sub { bless [ @{$_[0]} ] },  # ...
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>If <span class="Li">'fallback'</span> is TRUE and no copy constructor is
      defined then, for objects not based on scalars, Perl may silently fall
      back on simple assignment - that is, assignment of the object reference.
      In effect, this disables the copy constructor mechanism since no new copy
      of the object data is created. This is almost certainly not what you want.
      (It is, however, consistent: for example, Perl's fallback for the
      <span class="Li">&quot;++&quot;</span> operator is to increment the
      reference itself.)</li>

<p class="Pp">Where there is only one operand (or only one operand with

<p class="Pp">Note on Step 7: some operators have a different semantic depending
    on the type of their operands. As there is no way to instruct Perl to treat

<p class="Pp">Similarly, <span class="Li">&quot;.=&quot;</span> and

  <dd>Any class derived from an overloaded class is also overloaded and inherits

      inheritance rules.
    <p class="Pp">For example, if <span class="Li">&quot;A&quot;</span> inherits

<p class="Pp">For some applications, the Perl parser mangles constants too much.
    It is possible to hook into this process via
    <span class="Li">&quot;overload::constant()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;overload::remove_constant()&quot;</span>
  functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">These functions take a hash as an argument. The recognized keys of
    this hash are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="integer"><a class="permalink" href="#integer">integer</a></dt>
  <dd>to overload integer constants,</dd>

  <dt id="qr"><a class="permalink" href="#qr">qr</a></dt>
  <dd>to overload constant pieces of regular expressions.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The corresponding values are references to functions which take
    three arguments: the first one is the <i>initial</i> string form of the
    constant, the second one is how Perl interprets this constant, the third one
    is how the constant is used. Note that the initial string form does not
    contain string delimiters, and has backslashes in backslash-delimiter
    combinations stripped (thus the value of delimiter is not relevant for
    processing of this string). The return value of this function is how this
    constant is going to be interpreted by Perl. The third argument is undefined
    unless for overloaded <span class="Li">&quot;q&quot;</span>- and
    <span class="Li">&quot;qr&quot;</span>- constants, it is
    <span class="Li">&quot;q&quot;</span> in single-quote context (comes from
    strings, regular expressions, and single-quote HERE documents), it is
    <span class="Li">&quot;tr&quot;</span> for arguments of
    <span class="Li">&quot;tr&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;y&quot;</span>
    operators, it is <span class="Li">&quot;s&quot;</span> for right-hand side
    of <span class="Li">&quot;s&quot;</span>-operator, and it is
    <span class="Li">&quot;qq&quot;</span> otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since an expression <span class="Li">&quot;ab$cd,,&quot;</span> is
    just a shortcut for <span class="Li">'ab' . $cd . ',,'</span>, it is
    expected that overloaded constant strings are equipped with reasonable
    overloaded catenation operator, otherwise absurd results will result.
    Similarly, negative numbers are considered as negations of positive
    constants.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that it is probably meaningless to call the functions
    <b>overload::constant()</b> and <b>overload::remove_constant()</b> from

<p class="Pp">What follows is subject to change RSN.</p>
<p class="Pp">The table of methods for all operations is cached in magic for the
    symbol table hash for the package. The cache is invalidated during
    processing of <span class="Li">&quot;use overload&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;no overload&quot;</span>, new function definitions,
    and changes in <span class="Li">@ISA</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">(Every SVish thing has a magic queue, and magic is an entry in
    that queue. This is how a single variable may participate in multiple forms
    of magic simultaneously. For instance, environment variables regularly have
    two forms at once: their <span class="Li">%ENV</span> magic and their taint
    magic. However, the magic which implements overloading is applied to the
    stashes, which are rarely used directly, thus should not slow down
  Perl.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If a package uses overload, it carries a special flag. This flag
    is also set when new functions are defined or <span class="Li">@ISA</span>
    is modified. There will be a slight speed penalty on the very first
    operation thereafter that supports overloading, while the overload tables
    are updated. If there is no overloading present, the flag is turned off.
    Thus the only speed penalty thereafter is the checking of this flag.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is expected that arguments to methods that are not explicitly
    supposed to be changed are constant (but this is not enforced).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Two-face_Scalars"><a class="permalink" href="#Two-face_Scalars">Two-face

<p class="Pp">Put this in <i>two_face.pm</i> in your Perl library directory:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  package two_face;             # Scalars with separate string and
                                # numeric values.
  sub new { my $p = shift; bless [@_], $p }
  use overload '&quot;&quot;' =&gt; \&amp;str, '0+' =&gt; \&amp;num, fallback =&gt; 1;
  sub num {shift-&gt;[1]}
  sub str {shift-&gt;[0]}

<p class="Pp">Use it as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  require two_face;
  my $seven = two_face-&gt;new(&quot;vii&quot;, 7);
  printf &quot;seven=$seven, seven=%d, eight=%d\n&quot;, $seven, $seven+1;
  print &quot;seven contains 'i'\n&quot; if $seven =~ /i/;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(The second line creates a scalar which has both a string value,
    and a numeric value.) This prints:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  seven=vii, seven=7, eight=8
  seven contains 'i'

<h2 class="Ss" id="Two-face_References"><a class="permalink" href="#Two-face_References">Two-face
  References</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Suppose you want to create an object which is accessible as both
    an array reference and a hash reference.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  package two_refs;
  use overload '%{}' =&gt; \&amp;gethash, '@{}' =&gt; sub { $ {shift()} };
  sub new {
    my $p = shift;
    bless \ [@_], $p;
  }
  sub gethash {
    my %h;
    my $self = shift;
    tie %h, ref $self, $self;
    \%h;
  }
  sub TIEHASH { my $p = shift; bless \ shift, $p }
  my %fields;
  my $i = 0;
  $fields{$_} = $i++ foreach qw{zero one two three};
  sub STORE {
    my $self = ${shift()};
    my $key = $fields{shift()};
    defined $key or die &quot;Out of band access&quot;;
    $$self-&gt;[$key] = shift;
  }
  sub FETCH {
    my $self = ${shift()};
    my $key = $fields{shift()};
    defined $key or die &quot;Out of band access&quot;;
    $$self-&gt;[$key];
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now one can access an object using both the array and hash
  syntax:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my $bar = two_refs-&gt;new(3,4,5,6);
  $bar-&gt;[2] = 11;
  $bar-&gt;{two} == 11 or die 'bad hash fetch';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note several important features of this example. First of all, the
    <i>actual</i> type of <span class="Li">$bar</span> is a scalar reference,
    and we do not overload the scalar dereference. Thus we can get the
    <i>actual</i> non-overloaded contents of <span class="Li">$bar</span> by
    just using <span class="Li">$$bar</span> (what we do in functions which
    overload dereference). Similarly, the object returned by the
    <b>TIEHASH()</b> method is a scalar reference.</p>
<p class="Pp">Second, we create a new tied hash each time the hash syntax is
    used. This allows us not to worry about a possibility of a reference loop,
    which would lead to a memory leak.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both these problems can be cured. Say, if we want to overload hash
    dereference on a reference to an object which is <i>implemented</i> as a
    hash itself, the only problem one has to circumvent is how to access this
    <i>actual</i> hash (as opposed to the <i>virtual</i> hash exhibited by the
    overloaded dereference operator). Here is one possible fetching routine:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  sub access_hash {
    my ($self, $key) = (shift, shift);
    my $class = ref $self;
    bless $self, 'overload::dummy'; # Disable overloading of %{}
    my $out = $self-&gt;{$key};
    bless $self, $class;        # Restore overloading
    $out;
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To remove creation of the tied hash on each access, one may an
    extra level of indirection which allows a non-circular structure of
    references:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  package two_refs1;
  use overload '%{}' =&gt; sub { ${shift()}-&gt;[1] },
               '@{}' =&gt; sub { ${shift()}-&gt;[0] };
  sub new {
    my $p = shift;
    my $a = [@_];
    my %h;
    tie %h, $p, $a;
    bless \ [$a, \%h], $p;
  }
  sub gethash {
    my %h;
    my $self = shift;
    tie %h, ref $self, $self;
    \%h;
  }
  sub TIEHASH { my $p = shift; bless \ shift, $p }
  my %fields;
  my $i = 0;
  $fields{$_} = $i++ foreach qw{zero one two three};
  sub STORE {
    my $a = ${shift()};
    my $key = $fields{shift()};
    defined $key or die &quot;Out of band access&quot;;
    $a-&gt;[$key] = shift;
  }
  sub FETCH {
    my $a = ${shift()};
    my $key = $fields{shift()};
    defined $key or die &quot;Out of band access&quot;;
    $a-&gt;[$key];
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now if <span class="Li">$baz</span> is overloaded like this, then
    <span class="Li">$baz</span> is a reference to a reference to the
    intermediate array, which keeps a reference to an actual array, and the
    access hash. The <b>tie()</b>ing object for the access hash is a reference
    to a reference to the actual array, so</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>There are no loops of references.</li>
  <li>Both &quot;objects&quot; which are blessed into the class
      <span class="Li">&quot;two_refs1&quot;</span> are references to a
      reference to an array, thus references to a <i>scalar</i>. Thus the
      accessor expression <span class="Li">&quot;$$foo-&gt;[$ind]&quot;</span>
      involves no overloaded operations.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Symbolic_Calculator"><a class="permalink" href="#Symbolic_Calculator">Symbolic
  Calculator</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Put this in <i>symbolic.pm</i> in your Perl library directory:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  package symbolic;             # Primitive symbolic calculator
  use overload nomethod =&gt; \&amp;wrap;
  sub new { shift; bless ['n', @_] }
  sub wrap {
    my ($obj, $other, $inv, $meth) = @_;
    ($obj, $other) = ($other, $obj) if $inv;
    bless [$meth, $obj, $other];
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This module is very unusual as overloaded modules go: it does not
    provide any usual overloaded operators, instead it provides an
    implementation for <span class="Li">&quot;nomethod&quot;</span>. In this
    example the <span class="Li">&quot;nomethod&quot;</span> subroutine returns
    an object which encapsulates operations done over the objects:
    <span class="Li">&quot;symbolic-&gt;new(3)&quot;</span> contains
    <span class="Li">&quot;['n', 3]&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;2
    +</span> <span class="Li">symbolic-&gt;new(3)&quot;</span> contains
    <span class="Li">&quot;['+', 2, ['n', 3]]&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is an example of the script which &quot;calculates&quot; the
    side of circumscribed octagon using the above package:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  require symbolic;
  my $iter = 1;                 # 2**($iter+2) = 8
  my $side = symbolic-&gt;new(1);
  my $cnt = $iter;
  while ($cnt--) {
    $side = (sqrt(1 + $side**2) - 1)/$side;
  }
  print &quot;OK\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The value of <span class="Li">$side</span> is</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  ['/', ['-', ['sqrt', ['+', 1, ['**', ['n', 1], 2]],
                       undef], 1], ['n', 1]]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that while we obtained this value using a nice little script,
    there is no simple way to <i>use</i> this value. In fact this value may be
    inspected in debugger (see perldebug), but only if
    <span class="Li">&quot;bareStringify&quot;</span> <b>O</b>ption is set, and
    not via <span class="Li">&quot;p&quot;</span> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">If one attempts to print this value, then the overloaded operator
    <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span> will be called, which will call
    <span class="Li">&quot;nomethod&quot;</span> operator. The result of this
    operator will be stringified again, but this result is again of type
    <span class="Li">&quot;symbolic&quot;</span>, which will lead to an infinite
    loop.</p>
<p class="Pp">Add a pretty-printer method to the module <i>symbolic.pm</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  sub pretty {
    my ($meth, $a, $b) = @{+shift};
    $a = 'u' unless defined $a;
    $b = 'u' unless defined $b;
    $a = $a-&gt;pretty if ref $a;
    $b = $b-&gt;pretty if ref $b;
    &quot;[$meth $a $b]&quot;;
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now one can finish the script by</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  print &quot;side = &quot;, $side-&gt;pretty, &quot;\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The method <span class="Li">&quot;pretty&quot;</span> is doing
    object-to-string conversion, so it is natural to overload the operator
    <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span> using this method. However, inside such
    a method it is not necessary to pretty-print the <i>components</i>
    <span class="Li">$a</span> and <span class="Li">$b</span> of an object. In
    the above subroutine <span class="Li">&quot;[$meth $a $b]&quot;</span> is a
    catenation of some strings and components <span class="Li">$a</span> and
    <span class="Li">$b</span>. If these components use overloading, the
    catenation operator will look for an overloaded operator
    <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>; if not present, it will look for an
    overloaded operator <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span>. Thus it is enough
    to use</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use overload nomethod =&gt; \&amp;wrap, '&quot;&quot;' =&gt; \&amp;str;
  sub str {
    my ($meth, $a, $b) = @{+shift};
    $a = 'u' unless defined $a;
    $b = 'u' unless defined $b;
    &quot;[$meth $a $b]&quot;;
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now one can change the last line of the script to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  print &quot;side = $side\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which outputs</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  side = [/ [- [sqrt [+ 1 [** [n 1 u] 2]] u] 1] [n 1 u]]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and one can inspect the value in debugger using all the possible
    methods.</p>
<p class="Pp">Something is still amiss: consider the loop variable
    <span class="Li">$cnt</span> of the script. It was a number, not an object.
    We cannot make this value of type
    <span class="Li">&quot;symbolic&quot;</span>, since then the loop will not
    terminate.</p>
<p class="Pp">Indeed, to terminate the cycle, the <span class="Li">$cnt</span>
    should become false. However, the operator
    <span class="Li">&quot;bool&quot;</span> for checking falsity is overloaded
    (this time via overloaded <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span>), and returns
    a long string, thus any object of type
    <span class="Li">&quot;symbolic&quot;</span> is true. To overcome this, we
    need a way to compare an object to 0. In fact, it is easier to write a
    numeric conversion routine.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is the text of <i>symbolic.pm</i> with such a routine added
    (and slightly modified <b>str()</b>):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  package symbolic;             # Primitive symbolic calculator
  use overload
    nomethod =&gt; \&amp;wrap, '&quot;&quot;' =&gt; \&amp;str, '0+' =&gt; \&amp;num;

    ($obj, $other) = ($other, $obj) if $inv;
    bless [$meth, $obj, $other];
  }
  sub str {
    my ($meth, $a, $b) = @{+shift};
    $a = 'u' unless defined $a;
    if (defined $b) {
      &quot;[$meth $a $b]&quot;;
    } else {
      &quot;[$meth $a]&quot;;
    }
  }
  my %subr = ( n =&gt; sub {$_[0]},
               sqrt =&gt; sub {sqrt $_[0]},
               '-' =&gt; sub {shift() - shift()},
               '+' =&gt; sub {shift() + shift()},
               '/' =&gt; sub {shift() / shift()},
               '*' =&gt; sub {shift() * shift()},
               '**' =&gt; sub {shift() ** shift()},
             );
  sub num {
    my ($meth, $a, $b) = @{+shift};
    my $subr = $subr{$meth}
      or die &quot;Do not know how to ($meth) in symbolic&quot;;
    $a = $a-&gt;num if ref $a eq __PACKAGE__;
    $b = $b-&gt;num if ref $b eq __PACKAGE__;
    $subr-&gt;($a,$b);
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">All the work of numeric conversion is done in
    <span class="Li">%subr</span> and <b>num()</b>. Of course,
    <span class="Li">%subr</span> is not complete, it contains only operators
    used in the example below. Here is the extra-credit question: why do we need
    an explicit recursion in <b>num()</b>? (Answer is at the end of this
    section.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Use this module like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  require symbolic;
  my $iter = symbolic-&gt;new(2);  # 16-gon
  my $side = symbolic-&gt;new(1);
  my $cnt = $iter;
  while ($cnt) {
    $cnt = $cnt - 1;            # Mutator '--' not implemented
    $side = (sqrt(1 + $side**2) - 1)/$side;
  }
  printf &quot;%s=%f\n&quot;, $side, $side;
  printf &quot;pi=%f\n&quot;, $side*(2**($iter+2));
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It prints (without so many line breaks)</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  [/ [- [sqrt [+ 1 [** [/ [- [sqrt [+ 1 [** [n 1] 2]]] 1]
                          [n 1]] 2]]] 1]
     [/ [- [sqrt [+ 1 [** [n 1] 2]]] 1] [n 1]]]=0.198912
  pi=3.182598
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The above module is very primitive. It does not implement mutator
    methods (<span class="Li">&quot;++&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;-=&quot;</span> and so on), does not do deep copying
    (not required without mutators!), and implements only those arithmetic
    operations which are used in the example.</p>
<p class="Pp">To implement most arithmetic operations is easy; one should just
    use the tables of operations, and change the code which fills
    <span class="Li">%subr</span> to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my %subr = ( 'n' =&gt; sub {$_[0]} );

</pre>
<p class="Pp">Since subroutines implementing assignment operators are not
    required to modify their operands (see &quot;Overloadable Operations&quot;

    these operators to <span class="Li">%subr</span> and defining a copy
    constructor (needed since Perl has no way to know that the implementation of
    <span class="Li">'+='</span> does not mutate the argument - see &quot;Copy
    Constructor&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">To implement a copy constructor, add <span class="Li">&quot;'='

<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  sub cpy {

<p class="Pp">To make <span class="Li">&quot;++&quot;</span> and

<p class="Pp">This finishes implementation of a primitive symbolic calculator in
    50 lines of Perl code. Since the numeric values of subexpressions are not
    cached, the calculator is very slow.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is the answer for the exercise: In the case of <b>str()</b>,
    we need no explicit recursion since the overloaded
    <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>-operator will fall back to an existing
    overloaded operator <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span>. Overloaded
    arithmetic operators <i>do not</i> fall back to numeric conversion if
    <span class="Li">&quot;fallback&quot;</span> is not explicitly requested.
    Thus without an explicit recursion <b>num()</b> would convert
    <span class="Li">&quot;['+', $a, $b]&quot;</span> to
    <span class="Li">&quot;$a + $b&quot;</span>, which would just rebuild the
    argument of <b>num()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you wonder why defaults for conversion are different for
    <b>str()</b> and <b>num()</b>, note how easy it was to write the symbolic
    calculator. This simplicity is due to an appropriate choice of defaults. One
    extra note: due to the explicit recursion <b>num()</b> is more fragile than
    <b>sym()</b>: we need to explicitly check for the type of
    <span class="Li">$a</span> and <span class="Li">$b</span>. If components
    <span class="Li">$a</span> and <span class="Li">$b</span> happen to be of
    some related type, this may lead to problems.</p>

<h2 class="Ss"><i>Really</i> Symbolic Calculator</h2>
<p class="Pp">One may wonder why we call the above calculator symbolic. The
    reason is that the actual calculation of the value of expression is
    postponed until the value is <i>used</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">To see it in action, add a method</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  sub STORE {

<p class="Pp">When Perl is run with the <b>-Do</b> switch or its equivalent,
    overloading induces diagnostic messages.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using the <span class="Li">&quot;m&quot;</span> command of Perl
    debugger (see perldebug) one can deduce which operations are overloaded (and
    which ancestor triggers this overloading). Say, if
    <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> is overloaded, then the method
    <span class="Li">&quot;(eq&quot;</span> is shown by debugger. The method
    <span class="Li">&quot;()&quot;</span> corresponds to the
    <span class="Li">&quot;fallback&quot;</span> key (in fact a presence of this
    method shows that this package has overloading enabled, and it is what is
    used by the <span class="Li">&quot;Overloaded&quot;</span> function of
    module <span class="Li">&quot;overload&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The module might issue the following warnings:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Odd"><a class="permalink" href="#Odd">Odd number of arguments for
    overload::constant</a></dt>
  <dd>(W) The call to overload::constant contained an odd number of arguments.
      The arguments should come in pairs.</dd>
  <dt>'%s' is not an overloadable type</dt>
  <dd>(W) You tried to overload a constant type the overload package is unaware
      of.</dd>
  <dt>'%s' is not a code reference</dt>
  <dd>(W) The second (fourth, sixth, ...) argument of overload::constant needs
      to be a code reference. Either an anonymous subroutine, or a reference to
      a subroutine.</dd>
  <dt id="overload"><a class="permalink" href="#overload">overload arg '%s' is
    invalid</a></dt>
  <dd>(W) <span class="Li">&quot;use overload&quot;</span> was passed an
      argument it did not recognize. Did you mistype an operator?</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS_AND_PITFALLS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS_AND_PITFALLS">BUGS
  AND PITFALLS</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>A pitfall when fallback is TRUE and Perl resorts to a built-in
      implementation of an operator is that some operators have more than one
      semantic, for example <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        use overload '0+' =&gt; sub { $_[0]-&gt;{n}; },
            fallback =&gt; 1;
        my $x = bless { n =&gt; 4 }, &quot;main&quot;;
        my $y = bless { n =&gt; 8 }, &quot;main&quot;;
        print $x | $y, &quot;\n&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You might expect this to output &quot;12&quot;. In fact, it
        prints &quot;&lt;&quot;: the ASCII result of treating &quot;|&quot; as a
        bitwise string operator - that is, the result of treating the operands
        as the strings &quot;4&quot; and &quot;8&quot; rather than numbers. The
        fact that numify (<span class="Li">&quot;0+&quot;</span>) is implemented
        but stringify (<span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span>) isn't makes no
        difference since the latter is simply autogenerated from the former.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The only way to change this is to provide your own subroutine
        for <span class="Li">'|'</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Magic autogeneration increases the potential for inadvertently creating
      self-referential structures. Currently Perl will not free self-referential
      structures until cycles are explicitly broken. For example,
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use overload '+' =&gt; 'add';
    sub add { bless [ \$_[0], \$_[1] ] };
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is asking for trouble, since</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $obj += $y;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will effectively become</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $obj = add($obj, $y, undef);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">with the same result as</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $obj = [\$obj, \$foo];
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Even if no <i>explicit</i> assignment-variants of operators
        are present in the script, they may be generated by the optimizer. For
        example,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    &quot;obj = $obj\n&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">may be optimized to</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $tmp = 'obj = ' . $obj;  $tmp .= &quot;\n&quot;;
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>The symbol table is filled with names looking like line-noise.</li>
  <li>This bug was fixed in Perl 5.18, but may still trip you up if you are
      using older versions:
    <p class="Pp">For the purpose of inheritance every overloaded package
        behaves as if <span class="Li">&quot;fallback&quot;</span> is present
        (possibly undefined). This may create interesting effects if some
        package is not overloaded, but inherits from two overloaded
      packages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Before Perl 5.14, the relation between overloading and <b>tie()</b>ing was
      broken. Overloading was triggered or not based on the <i>previous</i>
      class of the <b>tie()</b>d variable.
    <p class="Pp">This happened because the presence of overloading was checked
        too early, before any <b>tie()</b>d access was attempted. If the class
        of the value <b>FETCH()</b>ed from the tied variable does not change, a
        simple workaround for code that is to run on older Perl versions is to
        access the value (via <span class="Li">&quot;() = $foo&quot;</span> or
        some such) immediately after <b>tie()</b>ing, so that after this call
        the <i>previous</i> class coincides with the current one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Barewords are not covered by overloaded string constants.</li>
  <li>The range operator <span class="Li">&quot;..&quot;</span> cannot be
      overloaded.</li>
