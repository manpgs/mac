    want</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Test::Kit allows you to create a single module in your project
    which gives you access to all of the testing functions you want.</p>
<p class="Pp">Its primary goal is to reduce boilerplate code that is currently
    littering the top of all your test files.</p>
<p class="Pp">It also allows your testing to be more consistent; for example it
    becomes a trivial change to include Test::FailWarnings in all of your tests,
    and there is no danger that you forget to include it in a new test.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="VERSION"><a class="permalink" href="#VERSION">VERSION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Test::Kit 2.0 is a complete rewrite of Test::Kit by a new
  author.</p>
<p class="Pp">It serves much the same purpose as the original Test::Kit, but
    comes with a completely new interface and some serious bugs ironed out.</p>
<p class="Pp">The 'features' such as '+explain' and '+on_fail' have been
    removed. If you were using these please contact me via rt.cpan.org.</p>

<pre>    package MyProject::Test;
    use Test::Kit;
    # Combine multiple modules' behaviour into one
    include 'Test::More';
    include 'Test::LongString';
    # Exclude or rename exported subs
    include 'Test::Warn' =&gt; {
        exclude =&gt; [ 'warning_is' ],
        renamed =&gt; {

  to find package to import into</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This means that Test::Kit was unable to determine which module
    <b>include()</b> was called from. It probably means you're doing something
    weird!</p>
<p class="Pp">If this is happening under any normal circumstances please file a
    bug report!</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Subroutine__s()_already_supplied_to__s_by__s"><a class="permalink" href="#Subroutine__s()_already_supplied_to__s_by__s">Subroutine
  %s() already supplied to %s by %s</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This happens when there is a subroutine name collision. For
    example if you try to include both Test::Simple and Test::More in your Kit
    it will complain that <b>ok()</b> has been defined twice.</p>
<p class="Pp">You should be able to use the exclude or rename options to solve
    these collisions.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Package__s_already_has_an_"><a class="permalink" href="#Package__s_already_has_an_">Package
  %s already has an <b>import()</b> sub</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This happens when your module has an import subroutine before the
    first <b>include()</b> call. This could be because you have defined one, or
    because your module has inherited an <b>import()</b> subroutine through an
    ISA relationship.</p>
<p class="Pp">Test::Kit intends to install its own import method into your
    module, specifically it is going to install Test::Builder::Module's
    <b>import()</b> method. Test::Builder::Module is an Exporter, so if you want
    to define your own subroutines and export those you can push onto
    <span class="Li">@EXPORT</span> after all the calls to <b>include()</b>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="COMPATIBILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#COMPATIBILITY">COMPATIBILITY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Test::Kit 2.15 and above should work with Test-Simple 1.0 and 1.3
    releases. Huge thanks to Chad Granum and Karen Etheridge for all their help
    with 1.3 support. I highly recommend upgrading to Test-Simple 1.3.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SEE_ALSO"><a class="permalink" href="#SEE_ALSO">SEE
  ALSO</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A couple of other modules try to generalize this problem beyond
    the scope of testing:</p>
<p class="Pp">ToolSet - Load your commonly-used modules in a single import</p>
<p class="Pp">Import::Base - Import a set of modules into the calling module</p>
<p class="Pp">Test::Kit largely differs from these in that it always makes your
    module behave like Test::More.</p>
