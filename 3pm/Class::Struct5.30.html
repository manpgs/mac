<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Class::Struct&quot;</span> exports a single
    function, <span class="Li">&quot;struct&quot;</span>. Given a list of
    element names and types, and optionally a class name,
    <span class="Li">&quot;struct&quot;</span> creates a Perl 5 class that
    implements a &quot;struct-like&quot; data structure.</p>
<p class="Pp">The new class is given a constructor method,
    <span class="Li">&quot;new&quot;</span>, for creating struct objects.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each element in the struct data has an accessor method, which is
    used to assign to the element and to fetch its value. The default accessor
    can be overridden by declaring a <span class="Li">&quot;sub&quot;</span> of
    the same name in the package. (See Example 2.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Each element's type can be scalar, array, hash, or class.</p>

    struct( CLASS_NAME =&gt; { ELEMENT_LIST });
    struct( ELEMENT_LIST );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first and second forms explicitly identify the name of the
    class being created. The third form assumes the current package name as the
    class name.</p>
<p class="Pp">An object of a class created by the first and third forms is based
    on an array, whereas an object of a class created by the second form is
    based on a hash. The array-based forms will be somewhat faster and smaller;
    the hash-based forms are more flexible.</p>
<p class="Pp">The class created by <span class="Li">&quot;struct&quot;</span>
    must not be a subclass of another class other than
    <span class="Li">&quot;UNIVERSAL&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">It can, however, be used as a superclass for other classes. To
    facilitate this, the generated constructor method uses a two-argument
    blessing. Furthermore, if the class is hash-based, the key of each element
    is prefixed with the class name (see <i>Perl Cookbook</i>, Recipe
  13.12).</p>
<p class="Pp">A function named <span class="Li">&quot;new&quot;</span> must not
    be explicitly defined in a class created by
    <span class="Li">&quot;struct&quot;</span>.</p>

<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    NAME =&gt; TYPE, ...

<p class="Pp">Each name-type pair declares one element of the struct. Each
    element name will be defined as an accessor method unless a method by that
    name is explicitly defined; in the latter case, a warning is issued if the
    warning flag (<b>-w</b>) is set.</p>

  Creation at Compile Time</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Class::Struct&quot;</span> can create your
    class at compile time. The main reason for doing this is obvious, so your
    class acts like every other class in Perl. Creating your class at compile
    time will make the order of events similar to using any other class ( or
    Perl module ).</p>
<p class="Pp">There is no significant speed gain between compile time and run
    time class creation, there is just a new, more standard order of events.</p>

<p class="Pp">Modified by Damian Conway, 2001-09-10, v0.62.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   Modified implicit construction of nested objects.
   Now will also take an object ref instead of requiring a hash ref.
   Also default initializes nested object attributes to undef, rather
   than calling object constructor without args
   Original over-helpfulness was fraught with problems:
       * the class's constructor might not be called 'new'
       * the class might not have a hash-like-arguments constructor
       * the class might not have a no-argument constructor
       * &quot;recursive&quot; data structures didn't work well:
                 package Person;
                 struct { mother =&gt; 'Person', father =&gt; 'Person'};
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Modified by Casey West, 2000-11-08, v0.59.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    Added the ability for compile time class creation.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Modified by Damian Conway, 1999-03-05, v0.58.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    Added handling of hash-like arg list to class ctor.

    Changed to two-argument blessing in ctor to support
    derivation from created classes.

    Added classname prefixes to keys in hash-based classes
    (refer to &quot;Perl Cookbook&quot;, Recipe 13.12 for rationale).

    Corrected behaviour of accessors for '*@' and '*%' struct
    elements.  Package now implements documented behaviour when
    returning a reference to an entire hash or array element.
    Previously these were returned as a reference to a reference
    to the element.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Renamed to <span class="Li">&quot;Class::Struct&quot;</span> and
    modified by Jim Miner, 1997-04-02.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    members() function removed.
    Documentation corrected and extended.
    Use of struct() in a subclass prohibited.
    User definition of accessor allowed.
    Treatment of '*' in element types corrected.
    Treatment of classes as element types corrected.
    Class name to struct() made optional.
    Diagnostic checks added.
