<p class="Pp"><b>STOP!</b> If you're just getting started writing tests, have a
    look at Test::Simple first. This is a drop in replacement for Test::Simple
    which you can switch to once you get the hang of basic testing.</p>
<p class="Pp">The purpose of this module is to provide a wide range of testing
    utilities. Various ways to say &quot;ok&quot; with better diagnostics,
    facilities to skip tests, test future features and compare complicated data
    structures. While you can do almost anything with a simple
    <span class="Li">&quot;ok()&quot;</span> function, it doesn't provide good
    diagnostic output.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="I_love_it_when_a_plan_comes_together"><a class="permalink" href="#I_love_it_when_a_plan_comes_together">I
  love it when a plan comes together</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Before anything else, you need a testing plan. This basically
    declares how many tests your script is going to run to protect against
    premature failure.</p>
<p class="Pp">The preferred way to do this is to declare a plan when you
    <span class="Li">&quot;use Test::More&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  use Test::More tests =&gt; 23;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There are cases when you will not know beforehand how many tests
    your script is going to run. In this case, you can declare your tests at the
    end.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  use Test::More;

  ... run your tests ...

  done_testing( $number_of_tests_run );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes you really don't know how many tests were run, or it's
    too difficult to calculate. In which case you can leave off
    <span class="Li">$number_of_tests_run</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In some cases, you'll want to completely skip an entire testing
    script.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  use Test::More skip_all =&gt; $skip_reason;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Your script will declare a skip with the reason why you skipped
    and exit immediately with a zero (success). See Test::Harness for
  details.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to control what functions Test::More will export, you
    have to use the 'import' option. For example, to import everything but
    'fail', you'd do:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  use Test::More tests =&gt; 23, import =&gt; ['!fail'];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, you can use the <i>plan()</i> function. Useful for
    when you have to calculate the number of tests.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  use Test::More;
  plan tests =&gt; keys %Stuff * 3;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or for deciding between running the tests at all:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  use Test::More;
  if( $^O eq 'MacOS' ) {
      plan skip_all =&gt; 'Test irrelevant on MacOS';
  }
  else {
      plan tests =&gt; 42;
  }
</pre>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="done_testing"><a class="permalink" href="#done_testing"><b>done_testing</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
    done_testing();
    done_testing($number_of_tests);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you don't know how many tests you're going to run, you can
        issue the plan when you're done running tests.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$number_of_tests</span> is the same as
        <i>plan()</i>, it's the number of tests you expected to run. You can
        omit this, in which case the number of tests you ran doesn't matter,
        just the fact that your tests ran to conclusion.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is safer than and replaces the &quot;no_plan&quot;
      plan.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Test_names"><a class="permalink" href="#Test_names">Test
  names</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">By convention, each test is assigned a number in order. This is
    largely done automatically for you. However, it's often very useful to
    assign a name to each test. Which would you rather see:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  ok 4
  not ok 5
  ok 6
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  ok 4 - basic multi-variable
  not ok 5 - simple exponential
  ok 6 - force == mass * acceleration
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The later gives you some idea of what failed. It also makes it
    easier to find the test in your script, simply search for &quot;simple
    exponential&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">All test functions take a name argument. It's optional, but highly
    suggested that you use it.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="I'm_ok,_you're_not_ok."><a class="permalink" href="#I'm_ok,_you're_not_ok.">I'm
  ok, you're not ok.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The basic purpose of this module is to print out either &quot;ok
    #&quot; or &quot;not ok #&quot; depending on if a given test succeeded or
    failed. Everything else is just gravy.</p>
<p class="Pp">All of the following print &quot;ok&quot; or &quot;not ok&quot;
    depending on if the test succeeded or failed. They all also return true or
    false, respectively.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="ok"><a class="permalink" href="#ok"><b>ok</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
  ok($got eq $expected, $test_name);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This simply evaluates any expression
        (<span class="Li">&quot;$got eq $expected&quot;</span> is just a simple
        example) and uses that to determine if the test succeeded or failed. A
        true expression passes, a false one fails. Very simple.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    ok( $exp{9} == 81,                   'simple exponential' );
    ok( Film-&gt;can('db_Main'),            'set_db()' );
    ok( $p-&gt;tests == 4,                  'saw tests' );
    ok( !grep !defined $_, @items,       'items populated' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(Mnemonic: &quot;This is ok.&quot;)</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$test_name</span> is a very short description
        of the test that will be printed out. It makes it very easy to find a
        test in your script when it fails and gives others an idea of your
        intentions. <span class="Li">$test_name</span> is optional, but we
        <b>very</b> strongly encourage its use.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Should an <i>ok()</i> fail, it will produce some
      diagnostics:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    not ok 18 - sufficient mucus
    #   Failed test 'sufficient mucus'
    #   in foo.t at line 42.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This is the same as Test::Simple's <i>ok()</i> routine.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="is"><a class="permalink" href="#is"><b>is</b></a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="isnt"><a class="permalink" href="#isnt"><b>isnt</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
  is  ( $got, $expected, $test_name );
  isnt( $got, $expected, $test_name );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Similar to <i>ok()</i>, <i>is()</i> and <i>isnt()</i> compare
        their two arguments with <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;ne&quot;</span> respectively and use the result
        of that to determine if the test succeeded or failed. So these:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    # Is the ultimate answer 42?
    is( ultimate_answer(), 42,          &quot;Meaning of Life&quot; );

    # $foo isn't empty
    isnt( $foo, '',     &quot;Got some foo&quot; );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">are similar to these:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    ok( ultimate_answer() eq 42,        &quot;Meaning of Life&quot; );
    ok( $foo ne '',     &quot;Got some foo&quot; );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> will only ever match
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>. So you can test a value
        agains <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    is($not_defined, undef, &quot;undefined as expected&quot;);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(Mnemonic: &quot;This is that.&quot; &quot;This isn't
        that.&quot;)</p>
    <p class="Pp">So why use these? They produce better diagnostics on failure.
        <i>ok()</i> cannot know what you are testing for (beyond the name), but
        <i>is()</i> and <i>isnt()</i> know what the test was and why it failed.
        For example this test:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    my $foo = 'waffle';  my $bar = 'yarblokos';
    is( $foo, $bar,   'Is foo the same as bar?' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Will produce something like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    not ok 17 - Is foo the same as bar?
    #   Failed test 'Is foo the same as bar?'
    #   in foo.t at line 139.
    #          got: 'waffle'
    #     expected: 'yarblokos'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">So you can figure out what went wrong without rerunning the
        test.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You are encouraged to use <i>is()</i> and <i>isnt()</i> over
        <i>ok()</i> where possible, however do not be tempted to use them to
        find out if something is true or false!</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  # XXX BAD!
  is( exists $brooklyn{tree}, 1, 'A tree grows in Brooklyn' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This does not check if <span class="Li">&quot;exists
        $brooklyn{tree}&quot;</span> is true, it checks if it returns 1. Very
        different. Similar caveats exist for false and 0. In these cases, use
        <i>ok()</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  ok( exists $brooklyn{tree},    'A tree grows in Brooklyn' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">A simple call to <i>isnt()</i> usually does not provide a
        strong test but there are cases when you cannot say much more about a
        value than that it is different from some other value:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  new_ok $obj, &quot;Foo&quot;;

  my $clone = $obj-&gt;clone;
  isa_ok $obj, &quot;Foo&quot;, &quot;Foo-&gt;clone&quot;;

  isnt $obj, $clone, &quot;clone() produces a different object&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For those grammatical pedants out there, there's an
        <span class="Li">&quot;isn't()&quot;</span> function which is an alias
        of <i>isnt()</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="like"><a class="permalink" href="#like"><b>like</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
  like( $got, qr/expected/, $test_name );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Similar to <i>ok()</i>, <i>like()</i> matches
        <span class="Li">$got</span> against the regex
        <span class="Li">&quot;qr/expected/&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">So this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    like($got, qr/expected/, 'this is like that');
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is similar to:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    ok( $got =~ /expected/, 'this is like that');
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(Mnemonic &quot;This is like that&quot;.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">The second argument is a regular expression. It may be given
        as a regex reference (i.e. <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span>) or
        (for better compatibility with older perls) as a string that looks like
        a regex (alternative delimiters are currently not supported):</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    like( $got, '/expected/', 'this is like that' );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Regex options may be placed on the end
        (<span class="Li">'/expected/i'</span>).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Its advantages over <i>ok()</i> are similar to that of
        <i>is()</i> and <i>isnt()</i>. Better diagnostics on failure.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="unlike"><a class="permalink" href="#unlike"><b>unlike</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
  unlike( $got, qr/expected/, $test_name );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Works exactly as <i>like()</i>, only it checks if
        <span class="Li">$got</span> <b>does not</b> match the given
      pattern.</p>
  </dd>

  <dd>
    <pre>
  cmp_ok( $got, $op, $expected, $test_name );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Halfway between <i>ok()</i> and <i>is()</i> lies
        <i>cmp_ok()</i>. This allows you to compare two arguments using any
        binary perl operator.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    # ok( $got eq $expected );
    cmp_ok( $got, 'eq', $expected, 'this eq that' );

    # ok( $got == $expected );
    cmp_ok( $got, '==', $expected, 'this == that' );

    # ok( $got &amp;&amp; $expected );
    cmp_ok( $got, '&amp;&amp;', $expected, 'this &amp;&amp; that' );
    ...etc...
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Its advantage over <i>ok()</i> is when the test fails you'll
        know what <span class="Li">$got</span> and
        <span class="Li">$expected</span> were:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    not ok 1
    #   Failed test in foo.t at line 12.
    #     '23'
    #         &amp;&amp;
    #     undef
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">It's also useful in those cases where you are comparing
        numbers and <i>is()</i>'s use of <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span>
        will interfere:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    cmp_ok( $big_hairy_number, '==', $another_big_hairy_number );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">It's especially useful when comparing greater-than or
        smaller-than relation between values:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    cmp_ok( $some_value, '&lt;=', $upper_limit );

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>

    <p class="Pp">A convenience function which combines creating an object and

<h2 class="Ss" id="Conditional_tests"><a class="permalink" href="#Conditional_tests">Conditional
  tests</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes running a test under certain conditions will cause the
    test script to die. A certain function or method isn't implemented (such as
    <i>fork()</i> on MacOS), some resource isn't available (like a net
    connection) or a module isn't available. In these cases it's necessary to
    skip tests, or declare that they are supposed to fail but will work in the
    future (a todo test).</p>
<p class="Pp">For more details on the mechanics of skip and todo tests see
    Test::Harness.</p>
<p class="Pp">The way Test::More handles this is with a named block. Basically,
    a block of tests which can be skipped over or made todo. It's best if I just
    show you...</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="SKIP:"><a class="permalink" href="#SKIP:"><b>SKIP: BLOCK</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
  SKIP: {
      skip $why, $how_many if $condition;

      ...normal testing code goes here...
  }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This declares a block of tests that might be skipped,
        <span class="Li">$how_many</span> tests there are,
        <span class="Li">$why</span> and under what
        <span class="Li">$condition</span> to skip them. An example is the
        easiest way to illustrate:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    SKIP: {
        eval { require HTML::Lint };

        skip &quot;HTML::Lint not installed&quot;, 2 if $@;

        my $lint = new HTML::Lint;
        isa_ok( $lint, &quot;HTML::Lint&quot; );

        $lint-&gt;parse( $html );
        is( $lint-&gt;errors, 0, &quot;No errors found in HTML&quot; );
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the user does not have HTML::Lint installed, the whole
        block of code <i>won't be run at all</i>. Test::More will output special
        ok's which Test::Harness interprets as skipped, but passing, tests.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It's important that <span class="Li">$how_many</span>
        accurately reflects the number of tests in the SKIP block so the # of
        tests run will match up with your plan. If your plan is
        <span class="Li">&quot;no_plan&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">$how_many</span> is optional and will default to 1.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It's perfectly safe to nest SKIP blocks. Each SKIP block must
        have the label <span class="Li">&quot;SKIP&quot;</span>, or Test::More
        can't work its magic.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You don't skip tests which are failing because there's a bug
        in your program, or for which you don't yet have code written. For that
        you use TODO. Read on.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="TODO:"><a class="permalink" href="#TODO:"><b>TODO: BLOCK</b></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
    TODO: {
        local $TODO = $why if $condition;

        ...normal testing code goes here...
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Declares a block of tests you expect to fail and
        <span class="Li">$why</span>. Perhaps it's because you haven't fixed a
        bug or haven't finished a new feature:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    TODO: {
        local $TODO = &quot;URI::Geller not finished&quot;;

        my $card = &quot;Eight of clubs&quot;;
        is( URI::Geller-&gt;your_card, $card, 'Is THIS your card?' );

        my $spoon;
        URI::Geller-&gt;bend_spoon;
        is( $spoon, 'bent',    &quot;Spoon bending, that's original&quot; );
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">With a todo block, the tests inside are expected to fail.
        Test::More will run the tests normally, but print out special flags
        indicating they are &quot;todo&quot;. Test::Harness will interpret
        failures as being ok. Should anything succeed, it will report it as an
        unexpected success. You then know the thing you had todo is done and can
        remove the TODO flag.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The nice part about todo tests, as opposed to simply
        commenting out a block of tests, is it's like having a programmatic todo
        list. You know how much work is left to be done, you're aware of what
        bugs there are, and you'll know immediately when they're fixed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Once a todo test starts succeeding, simply move it outside the
        block. When the block is empty, delete it.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="todo_skip"><a class="permalink" href="#todo_skip"><b>todo_skip</b></a></dt>

    TODO: {
        todo_skip $why, $how_many if $condition;

        ...normal testing code...
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">With todo tests, it's best to have the tests actually run.
        That way you'll know when they start passing. Sometimes this isn't
        possible. Often a failing test will cause the whole program to die or
        hang, even inside an <span class="Li">&quot;eval BLOCK&quot;</span> with
        and using <span class="Li">&quot;alarm&quot;</span>. In these extreme
        cases you have no choice but to skip over the broken tests entirely.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The syntax and behavior is similar to a
        <span class="Li">&quot;SKIP: BLOCK&quot;</span> except the tests will be
        marked as failing but todo. Test::Harness will interpret them as

  <dt id="Overloaded"><a class="permalink" href="#Overloaded">Overloaded
    objects</a></dt>
  <dd>String overloaded objects are compared <b>as strings</b> (or in
      <i>cmp_ok()</i>'s case, strings or numbers as appropriate to the
      comparison op). This prevents Test::More from piercing an object's
      interface allowing better blackbox testing. So if a function starts
      returning overloaded objects instead of bare strings your tests won't
      notice the difference. This is good.
    <p class="Pp">However, it does mean that functions like <i>is_deeply()</i>
        cannot be used to test the internals of string overloaded objects. In
        this case I would suggest Test::Deep which contains more flexible
        testing functions for complex data structures.</p>

  <dd>Test::More will only be aware of threads if &quot;use threads&quot; has
      been done <i>before</i> Test::More is loaded. This is ok:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    use threads;
    use Test::More;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This may cause problems:</p>

    <pre>
    use Test::More
    use threads;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">5.8.1 and above are supported. Anything below that has too
        many bugs.</p>

<p class="Pp">This is a case of convergent evolution with Joshua Pritikin's Test
    module. I was largely unaware of its existence when I'd first written my own
    <i>ok()</i> routines. This module exists because I can't figure out how to
    easily wedge test names into Test's interface (along with a few other
    problems).</p>
<p class="Pp">The goal here is to have a testing utility that's simple to learn,
    quick to use and difficult to trip yourself up with while still providing
    more flexibility than the existing Test.pm. As such, the names of the most
    common routines are kept tiny, special cases and magic side-effects are kept
    to a minimum. WYSIWYG.</p>

<p class="Pp">Test::Simple if all this confuses you and you just want to write
    some tests. You can upgrade to Test::More later (it's forward
  compatible).</p>
<p class="Pp">Test::Harness is the test runner and output interpreter for Perl.
    It's the thing that powers <span class="Li">&quot;make test&quot;</span> and
    where the <span class="Li">&quot;prove&quot;</span> utility comes from.</p>
<p class="Pp">Test::Legacy tests written with Test.pm, the original testing
    module, do not play well with other testing libraries. Test::Legacy emulates
    the Test.pm interface and does play well with others.</p>
<p class="Pp">Test::Differences for more ways to test complex data structures.
    And it plays well with Test::More.</p>
<p class="Pp">Test::Class is like xUnit but more perlish.</p>
<p class="Pp">Test::Deep gives you more powerful complex data structure
  testing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Test::Inline shows the idea of embedded testing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Bundle::Test installs a whole bunch of useful test modules.</p>
