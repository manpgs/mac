    colons then it's prefixed with
    <span class="Li">&quot;DBD::Gofer::Transport::&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;dsn=$original_dsn&quot;</span> part
    <i>must be the last element</i> of the DSN because everything after

    remote DBI should use.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> represents attributes
    that influence the operation of the Gofer driver or transport. These are
    described below or in the documentation of the transport module being
  used.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">DBD::Gofer is a DBI database driver that forwards requests to
    another DBI driver, usually in a separate process, often on a separate
    machine. It tries to be as transparent as possible so it appears that you
    are using the remote driver directly.</p>
<p class="Pp">DBD::Gofer is very similar to DBD::Proxy. The major difference is
    that with DBD::Gofer no state is maintained on the remote end. That means
    every request contains all the information needed to create the required
    state. (So, for example, every request includes the DSN to connect to.) Each
    request can be sent to any available server. The server executes the request
    and returns a single response that includes all the data.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is very similar to the way http works as a stateless protocol
    for the web. Each request from your web browser can be handled by a
    different web server process.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Use_Cases"><a class="permalink" href="#Use_Cases">Use
  Cases</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This may seem like pointless overhead but there are situations
    where this is a very good thing. Let's consider a specific case.</p>
<p class="Pp">Imagine using DBD::Gofer with an http transport. Your application
    calls <b>connect()</b>, prepare(&quot;select * from table where
    foo=?&quot;), <b>bind_param()</b>, and <b>execute()</b>. At this point
    DBD::Gofer builds a request containing all the information about the method
    calls. It then uses the httpd transport to send that request to an apache
    web server.</p>
<p class="Pp">This 'dbi execute' web server executes the request (using
    DBI::Gofer::Execute and related modules) and builds a response that contains
    all the rows of data, if the statement returned any, along with all the
    attributes that describe the results, such as
    <span class="Li">$sth</span>-&gt;{NAME}. This response is sent back to
    DBD::Gofer which unpacks it and presents it to the application as if it had
    executed the statement itself.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Advantages"><a class="permalink" href="#Advantages">Advantages</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Okay, but you still don't see the point? Well let's consider what
    we've gained:</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Connection Pooling and Throttling</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The 'dbi execute' web server leverages all the functionality of
    web infrastructure in terms of load balancing, high-availability, firewalls,
    access management, proxying, caching.</p>
<p class="Pp">At its most basic level you get a configurable pool of persistent
    database connections.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Simple Scaling</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Got thousands of processes all trying to connect to the database?
    You can use DBD::Gofer to connect them to your smaller pool of 'dbi execute'
    web servers instead.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Caching</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Client-side caching is as simple as adding
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;cache=1&quot;</span>&quot; to the DSN. This
    feature alone can be worth using DBD::Gofer for.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Fewer Network Round-trips</i></p>
<p class="Pp">DBD::Gofer sends as few requests as possible (dependent on the
    policy being used).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Thin Clients / Unsupported Platforms</i></p>
<p class="Pp">You no longer need drivers for your database on every system.
    DBD::Gofer is pure perl.</p>

<p class="Pp">You can't change database handle attributes after you've
    connected. Use the <b>connect()</b> call to specify all the attribute
    settings you want.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is because it's critical that when a request is complete the
    database handle is left in the same state it was when first connected.</p>
<p class="Pp">An exception is made for attributes with names starting
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;private_&quot;</span>&quot;: They can be set

  tables, locks, and other per-connection persistent state</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You shouldn't expect any per-session state to persist between
    requests. This includes locks and temporary tables.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because the server-side may execute your requests via a different
    database connections, you can't rely on any per-connection persistent state,
    such as temporary tables, being available from one request to the next.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is an easy trap to fall into. A good way to check for this is
    to test your code with a Gofer policy package that sets the
    <span class="Li">&quot;connect_method&quot;</span> policy to 'connect' to
    force a new connection for each request. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;pedantic&quot;</span> policy does this.</p>

<p class="Pp">Some drivers may update one or more dbh attributes after

    <span class="Li">$dbh</span>-&gt;{mysql_insertid} in addition to
    <span class="Li">$sth</span>-&gt;{mysql_insertid}. Currently mysql_insertid

<p class="Pp">With DBD::Gofer, a method that sets an error always return an

    <b>do()</b> or <b>prepare()</b> method calls. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<p class="Pp">The array methods <b>bind_param_array()</b> and
    <b>execute_array()</b> are supported. When <b>execute_array()</b> is called
    the data is serialized and executed in a single round-trip to the Gofer
    server. This makes it very fast, but requires enough memory to store all the
    serialized data.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>execute_for_fetch()</b> method currently isn't optimised,
    it uses the DBI fallback behaviour of executing each tuple individually. (It
    could be implemented as a wrapper for <b>execute_array()</b> - patches
    welcome.)</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="TRANSPORTS"><a class="permalink" href="#TRANSPORTS">TRANSPORTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">DBD::Gofer doesn't concern itself with transporting requests and
    responses to and fro. For that it uses special Gofer transport modules.</p>
<p class="Pp">Gofer transport modules usually come in pairs: one for the
    'client' DBD::Gofer driver to use and one for the remote 'server' end. They
    have very similar names:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    DBD::Gofer::Transport::&lt;foo&gt;
    DBI::Gofer::Transport::&lt;foo&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes the transports on the DBD and DBI sides may have
    different names. For example DBD::Gofer::Transport::http is typically used
    with DBI::Gofer::Transport::mod_perl (DBD::Gofer::Transport::http and
    DBI::Gofer::Transport::mod_perl modules are part of the GoferTransport-http
    distribution).</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Bundled_Transports"><a class="permalink" href="#Bundled_Transports">Bundled
  Transports</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Several transport modules are provided with DBD::Gofer:</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>null</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The null transport is the simplest of them all. It doesn't
    actually transport the request anywhere. It just serializes (freezes) the
    request into a string, then thaws it back into a data structure before
    passing it to DBI::Gofer::Execute to execute. The same freeze and thaw is
    applied to the results.</p>
<p class="Pp">The null transport is the best way to test if your application
    will work with Gofer. Just set the DBI_AUTOPROXY environment variable to
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;dbi:Gofer:transport=null;policy=pedantic&quot;</span>&quot;
    (see &quot;Using DBI_AUTOPROXY&quot; below) and run your application, or
    ideally its test suite, as usual.</p>
<p class="Pp">It doesn't take any parameters.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>pipeone</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The pipeone transport launches a subprocess for each request. It
    passes in the request and reads the response.</p>
<p class="Pp">The fact that a new subprocess is started for each request ensures
    that the server side is truly stateless. While this does make the transport
    <i>very</i> slow, it is useful as a way to test that your application
    doesn't depend on per-connection state, such as temporary tables, persisting
    between requests.</p>
<p class="Pp">It's also useful both as a proof of concept and as a base class
    for the stream driver.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>stream</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The stream driver also launches a subprocess and writes requests
    and reads responses, like the pipeone transport. In this case, however, the
    subprocess is expected to handle more that one request. (Though it will be
    automatically restarted if it exits.)</p>
<p class="Pp">This is the first transport that is truly useful because it can
    launch the subprocess on a remote machine using
    <span class="Li">&quot;ssh&quot;</span>. This means you can now use
    DBD::Gofer to easily access any databases that's accessible from any system
    you can login to. You also get all the benefits of ssh, including encryption
    and optional compression.</p>
<p class="Pp">See &quot;Using DBI_AUTOPROXY&quot; below for an example.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Other_Transports"><a class="permalink" href="#Other_Transports">Other

<p class="Pp">Implementing a Gofer transport is <i>very</i> simple, and more
    transports are very welcome. Just take a look at any existing transports

    where <span class="Li">$transport</span> is the name of the Gofer transport
    you want to use (see &quot;TRANSPORTS&quot;). The
    <span class="Li">&quot;transport&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;dsn&quot;</span> attributes must be specified and the
    <span class="Li">&quot;dsn&quot;</span> attributes must be last.</p>
<p class="Pp">Other attributes can be specified in the DSN to configure
    DBD::Gofer and/or the Gofer transport module being used. The main attributes

<p class="Pp"><i>timeout</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Specifies a timeout, in seconds, to use when waiting for responses

<p class="Pp"><i>retry_limit</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Specifies the number of times a failed request will be retried.
    Default is 0.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>retry_hook</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Specifies a code reference to be called to decide if a failed

<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $transport = $h-&gt;{go_transport};
  $retry = $transport-&gt;go_retry_hook-&gt;($request, $response, $transport);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If it returns true then the request will be retried, up to the
    <span class="Li">&quot;retry_limit&quot;</span>. If it returns a false but
    defined value then the request will not be retried. If it returns undef then
    the default behaviour will be used, as if

<p class="Pp"><i>cache</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Specifies that client-side caching should be performed. The value
    is the name of a cache class to use.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any class implementing get($key) and set($key,
    <span class="Li">$value</span>) methods can be used. That includes a great
    many powerful caching classes on CPAN, including the Cache and Cache::Cache
    distributions.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can use
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;cache=1&quot;</span>&quot; is a shortcut for
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;cache=DBI::Util::CacheMemory&quot;</span>&quot;.
    See DBI::Util::CacheMemory for a description of this simple fast default
    cache.</p>
<p class="Pp">The cache object can be accessed via
    <span class="Li">$h</span>-&gt;go_cache. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $dbh-&gt;go_cache-&gt;clear; # free up memory being used by the cache
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The cache keys are the frozen (serialized) requests, and the
    values are the frozen responses.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default behaviour is to only use the cache for requests where
    <span class="Li">$request</span>-&gt;is_idempotent is true (i.e., the dbh
    has the ReadOnly attribute set or the SQL statement is obviously a SELECT
    without a FOR UPDATE clause.)</p>
<p class="Pp">For even more control you can use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;go_cache&quot;</span> attribute to pass in an
    instantiated cache object. Individual methods, including <b>prepare()</b>,
    can also specify alternative caches via the
    <span class="Li">&quot;go_cache&quot;</span> attribute. For example, to
    specify no caching for a particular query, you could use</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare( $sql, { go_cache =&gt; 0 } );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This can be used to implement different caching policies for
    different statements.</p>
<p class="Pp">It's interesting to note that DBD::Gofer can be used to add
    client-side caching to any (gofer compatible) application, with no code
    changes and no need for a gofer server. Just set the DBI_AUTOPROXY
    environment variable like this:</p>

<p class="Pp">DBD::Gofer supports a 'policy' mechanism that allows you to
    fine-tune the number of round-trips to the Gofer server. The policies are
    grouped into classes (which may be subclassed) and referenced by the name of
    the class.</p>
<p class="Pp">The DBD::Gofer::Policy::Base class is the base class for all the
    policy packages and describes all the available policies.</p>
<p class="Pp">Three policy packages are supplied with DBD::Gofer:</p>
<p class="Pp">DBD::Gofer::Policy::pedantic is most 'transparent' but slowest
    because it makes more round-trips to the Gofer server.</p>
<p class="Pp">DBD::Gofer::Policy::classic is a reasonable compromise - it's the
    default policy.</p>
<p class="Pp">DBD::Gofer::Policy::rush is fastest, but may require code changes
    in your applications.</p>
<p class="Pp">Generally the default <span class="Li">&quot;classic&quot;</span>
    policy is fine. When first testing an existing application with Gofer it is
    a good idea to start with the <span class="Li">&quot;pedantic&quot;</span>
    policy first and then switch to <span class="Li">&quot;classic&quot;</span>
    or a custom policy, for final testing.</p>

<p class="Pp">This section aims to record issues to be aware of when using Gofer
    with specific drivers. It usually only documents issues that are not natural
    consequences of the limitations of the Gofer approach - as documented
  above.</p>

<p class="Pp">This is just a random brain dump... (There's more in the source of
    the Changes file, not the pod)</p>
<p class="Pp">Document policy mechanism</p>
<p class="Pp">Add mechanism for transports to list config params and for Gofer
    to apply any that match (and warn if any left over?)</p>
<p class="Pp">Driver-private sth attributes - set via <b>prepare()</b> - change
    DBI spec</p>
<p class="Pp">add hooks into transport base class for checking &amp; updating a
    result set cache
  <br/>
   ie via a standard cache interface such as:
  <br/>
   http://search.cpan.org/~robm/Cache-FastMmap/FastMmap.pm
  <br/>
   http://search.cpan.org/~bradfitz/Cache-Memcached/lib/Cache/Memcached.pm
  <br/>
   http://search.cpan.org/~dclinton/Cache-Cache/
  <br/>
   http://search.cpan.org/~cleishman/Cache/ Also caching instructions could be
    passed through the httpd transport layer in such a way that appropriate http
    cache headers are added to the results so that web caches (squid etc) could
    be used to implement the caching. (MUST require the use of GET rather than
    POST requests.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Rework handling of installed_methods to not piggyback on
    dbh_attributes?</p>
<p class="Pp">Perhaps support transactions for transports where it's possible
    (ie null and stream)? Would make stream transport (ie ssh) more useful to
    more people.</p>
<p class="Pp">Make sth_result_attr more like dbh_attributes (using '*' etc)</p>
<p class="Pp">Add <span class="Li">@val</span> = FETCH_many(@names) to DBI in C
    and use in Gofer/Execute?</p>
<p class="Pp">Implement _new_sth in C.</p>
