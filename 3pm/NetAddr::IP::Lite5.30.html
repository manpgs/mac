  print &quot;You can also say $ip...\n&quot;;

  The following four functions return ipV6 representations of:

  ::                                       = Zeros();
  FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF:FFFF  = Ones();

  ::FFFF:FFFF                              = V4net();

  Will also return an ipV4 or ipV6 representation of a
  resolvable Fully Qualified Domanin Name (FQDN).

<p class="Pp">This module provides an object-oriented abstraction on top of IP
    addresses or IP subnets, that allows for easy manipulations. Most of the
    operations of NetAddr::IP are supported. This module will work with older
    versions of Perl and is compatible with Math::BigInt.</p>
<p class="Pp">* By default <b>NetAddr::IP</b> functions and methods return
    string IPv6 addresses in uppercase. To change that to lowercase:</p>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: the AUGUST 2010 RFC5952 states:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    4.3. Lowercase

      The characters &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;f&quot; in an IPv6
      address MUST be represented in lowercase.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It is recommended that all NEW applications using
    NetAddr::IP::Lite be invoked as shown on the next line.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<p class="Pp">* To ensure the current IPv6 string case behavior even if the
    default changes:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  use NetAddr::IP::Lite qw(:upper);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The internal representation of all IP objects is in 128 bit IPv6
    notation. IPv4 and IPv6 objects may be freely mixed.</p>

  <dt>&quot;-&gt;first()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Returns a new object representing the first usable IP address within the

  <dd>Returns a new object representing the <i>n</i>-th usable IP address within
      the subnet (ie, the <i>n</i>-th host address). If no address is available
      (for example, when the network is too small for

      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> is returned.
    <p class="Pp">Version 4.00 of NetAddr::IP and version 1.00 of
        NetAddr::IP::Lite implements
        <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;nth($index)&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;num()&quot;</span> exactly as the
        documentation states. Previous versions behaved slightly differently and
        not in a consistent manner.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To use the old behavior for
        <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;nth($index)&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;num()&quot;</span>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  use NetAddr::IP::Lite qw(:old_nth);

  old behavior:
  NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('10/32')-&gt;nth(0) == undef
  NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('10/32')-&gt;nth(1) == undef
  NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('10/31')-&gt;nth(0) == undef
  NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('10/31')-&gt;nth(1) == 10.0.0.1/31
  NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('10/30')-&gt;nth(0) == undef
  NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('10/30')-&gt;nth(1) == 10.0.0.1/30
  NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('10/30')-&gt;nth(2) == 10.0.0.2/30
  NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('10/30')-&gt;nth(3) == 10.0.0.3/30
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that in each case, the broadcast address is represented
        in the output set and that the 'zero'th index is alway undef except for
        a point-to-point /31 or /127 network where there are exactly two
        addresses in the network.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  new behavior:
  NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('10/32')-&gt;nth(0)  == 10.0.0.0/32
  NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('10.1/32'-&gt;nth(0) == 10.0.0.1/32
  NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('10/31')-&gt;nth(0)  == 10.0.0.0/32
  NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('10/31')-&gt;nth(1)  == 10.0.0.1/32
  NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('10/30')-&gt;nth(0) == 10.0.0.1/30
  NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('10/30')-&gt;nth(1) == 10.0.0.2/30
  NetAddr::IP-&gt;new('10/30')-&gt;nth(2) == undef
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that a /32 net always has 1 usable address while a /31
        has exactly two usable addresses for point-to-point addressing. The
        first index (0) returns the address immediately following the network
        address except for a /31 or /127 when it return the network address.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;-&gt;num()&quot;</dt>
  <dd>As of version 4.42 of NetAddr::IP and version 1.27 of NetAddr::IP::Lite a
      /31 and /127 with return a net <b>num</b> value of 2 instead of 0 (zero)
      for point-to-point networks.
    <p class="Pp">Version 4.00 of NetAddr::IP and version 1.00 of
        NetAddr::IP::Lite return the number of usable IP addresses within the
        subnet, not counting the broadcast or network address.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Previous versions worked only for ipV4 addresses, returned a
        maximum span of 2**32 and returned the number of IP addresses not
        counting the broadcast address. 	(one greater than the new behavior)</p>
    <p class="Pp">To use the old behavior for
        <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;nth($index)&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;num()&quot;</span>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  use NetAddr::IP::Lite qw(:old_nth);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">WARNING:</p>
    <p class="Pp">NetAddr::IP will calculate and return a numeric string for
        network ranges as large as 2**128. These values are TEXT strings and
        perl can treat them as integers for numeric calculations.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl on 32 bit platforms only handles integer numbers up to
        2**32 and on 64 bit platforms to 2**64.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you wish to manipulate numeric strings returned by
        NetAddr::IP that are larger than 2**32 or 2**64, respectively, you must
        load additional modules such as Math::BigInt, bignum or some similar
        package to do the integer math.</p>
