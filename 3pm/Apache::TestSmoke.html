  Problem</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When we try to test a stateless machine (i.e. all tests are
    independent), running all tests once ensures that all tested things properly
    work. However when a state machine is tested (i.e. where a run of one test
    may influence another test) it's not enough to run all the tests once to
    know that the tested features actually work. It's quite possible that if the
    same tests are run in a different order and/or repeated a few times, some
    tests may fail. This usually happens when some tests don't restore the
    system under test to its pristine state at the end of the run, which may
    influence other tests which rely on the fact that they start on pristine
    state, when in fact it's not true anymore. In fact it's possible that a
    single test may fail when run twice or three times in a sequence.</p>

  Solution</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">To reduce the possibility of such dependency errors, it's helpful
    to run random testing repeated many times with many different srand seeds.
    Of course if no failures get spotted that doesn't mean that there are no
    tests inter-dependencies, which may cause a failure in production. But
    random testing definitely helps to spot many problems and can give better
    test coverage.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Resolving_Sequence_Problems"><a class="permalink" href="#Resolving_Sequence_Problems">Resolving
  Sequence Problems</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When this kind of testing is used and a failure is detected there
    are two problems:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>First is to be able to reproduce the problem so if we think we fixed it,
      we could verify the fix. This one is easy, just remember the sequence of
      tests run till the failed test and rerun the same sequence once again
      after the problem has been fixed.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Second is to be able to understand the cause of the problem. If during the
      random test the failure has happened after running 400 tests, how can we
      possibly know which previously running tests has caused to the failure of
      the test 401. Chances are that most of the tests were clean and don't have
      inter-dependency problem. Therefore it'd be very helpful if we could
      reduce the long sequence to a minimum. Preferably 1 or 2 tests. That's
      when we can try to understand the cause of the detected problem.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">This utility attempts to solve both problems, and at the end of
    each iteration print a minimal sequence of tests causing to a failure. This
    doesn't always succeed, but works in many cases.</p>
<p class="Pp">This utility:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Runs the tests randomly until the first failure is detected. Or
      non-randomly if the option <i>-order</i> is set to <i>repeat</i> or
      <i>rotate</i>.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Then it tries to reduce that sequence of tests to a minimum, and this
      sequence still causes to the same failure.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>(XXX: todo): then it reruns the minimal sequence in the verbose mode and
      saves the output.</dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>It reports all the successful reductions as it goes to STDOUT and report
      file of the format: smoke-report-&lt;date&gt;.txt.
    <p class="Pp">In addition the systems build parameters are logged into the
        report file, so the detected problems could be reproduced.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>5.</dt>
  <dd>Goto 1 and run again using a new random seed, which potentially should
      detect different failures.</dd>
</dl>

  Algorithm</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Currently for each reduction path, the following reduction
    algorithms get applied:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Binary search: first try the upper half then the lower.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Random window: randomize the left item, then the right item and return the
      items between these two points.</dd>

<p class="Pp"><i>t/SMOKE.PL</i> is driving this module, if you don't have it,
    create it:</p>

<pre>
  #!perl

  use strict;
  use warnings FATAL =&gt; 'all';

  use FindBin;
  use lib &quot;$FindBin::Bin/../Apache-Test/lib&quot;;

<p class="Pp">usually <i>Makefile.PL</i> converts it into <i>t/SMOKE</i> while
    adjusting the perl path, but you create <i>t/SMOKE</i> in first place as
    well.</p>
