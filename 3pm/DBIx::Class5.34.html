<h2 class="Ss">API usage</h2>
<p class="Pp">Then you can use these classes in your application's code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  # Connect to your database.
  use MyApp::Schema;
  my $schema = MyApp::Schema-&gt;connect($dbi_dsn, $user, $pass, \%dbi_params);
  # Query for all artists and put them in an array,
  # or retrieve them as a result set object.
  # $schema-&gt;resultset returns a DBIx::Class::ResultSet
  my @all_artists = $schema-&gt;resultset('Artist')-&gt;all;
  my $all_artists_rs = $schema-&gt;resultset('Artist');
  # Output all artists names
  # $artist here is a DBIx::Class::Row, which has accessors
  # for all its columns. Rows are also subclasses of your Result class.
  foreach $artist (@all_artists) {
    print $artist-&gt;name, &quot;\n&quot;;
  }
  # Create a result set to search for artists.
  # This does not query the DB.
  my $johns_rs = $schema-&gt;resultset('Artist')-&gt;search(
    # Build your WHERE using an SQL::Abstract structure:
    { name =&gt; { like =&gt; 'John%' } }
  );
  # Execute a joined query to get the cds.
  my @all_john_cds = $johns_rs-&gt;search_related('cds')-&gt;all;
  # Fetch the next available row.
  my $first_john = $johns_rs-&gt;next;
  # Specify ORDER BY on the query.
  my $first_john_cds_by_title_rs = $first_john-&gt;cds(
    undef,
    { order_by =&gt; 'title' }
  );
  # Create a result set that will fetch the artist data
  # at the same time as it fetches CDs, using only one query.
  my $millennium_cds_rs = $schema-&gt;resultset('CD')-&gt;search(
    { year =&gt; 2000 },
    { prefetch =&gt; 'artist' }
  );
  my $cd = $millennium_cds_rs-&gt;next; # SELECT ... FROM cds JOIN artists ...
  my $cd_artist_name = $cd-&gt;artist-&gt;name; # Already has the data so no 2nd query
  # new() makes a Result object but doesn't insert it into the DB.
  # create() is the same as new() then insert().
  my $new_cd = $schema-&gt;resultset('CD')-&gt;new({ title =&gt; 'Spoon' });
  $new_cd-&gt;artist($cd-&gt;artist);
  $new_cd-&gt;insert; # Auto-increment primary key filled in after INSERT
  $new_cd-&gt;title('Fork');
  $schema-&gt;txn_do(sub { $new_cd-&gt;update }); # Runs the update in a transaction
  # change the year of all the millennium CDs at once
  $millennium_cds_rs-&gt;update({ year =&gt; 2002 });

<p class="Pp">This is an SQL to OO mapper with an object API inspired by
    Class::DBI (with a compatibility layer as a springboard for porting) and a
    resultset API that allows abstract encapsulation of database operations. It
    aims to make representing queries in your code as perl-ish as possible while
    still providing access to as many of the capabilities of the database as
    possible, including retrieving related records from multiple tables in a
    single query, <span class="Li">&quot;JOIN&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;LEFT JOIN&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;COUNT&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;DISTINCT&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;GROUP
    BY&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;ORDER BY&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;HAVING&quot;</span> support.</p>
<p class="Pp">DBIx::Class can handle multi-column primary and foreign keys,
    complex queries and database-level paging, and does its best to only query
    the database in order to return something you've directly asked for. If a
    resultset is used as an iterator it only fetches rows off the statement
    handle as requested in order to minimise memory usage. It has auto-increment
    support for SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server and DB2 and is
    known to be used in production on at least the first four, and is fork- and
    thread-safe out of the box (although your DBD may not be).</p>
<p class="Pp">This project is still under rapid development, so large new
    features may be marked <b>experimental</b> - such APIs are still usable but
    may have edge bugs. Failing test cases are <i>always</i> welcome and point
    releases are put out rapidly as bugs are found and fixed.</p>
<p class="Pp">We do our best to maintain full backwards compatibility for
    published APIs, since DBIx::Class is used in production in many
    organisations, and even backwards incompatible changes to non-published APIs
    will be fixed if they're reported and doing so doesn't cost the codebase
    anything.</p>
<p class="Pp">The test suite is quite substantial, and several developer
    releases are generally made to CPAN before the branch for the next release
    is merged back to trunk for a major release.</p>

<p class="Pp">Even though a large portion of the source <i>appears</i> to be

    collaborative effort - perhaps one of the most successful such projects on
    CPAN &lt;http://cpan.org&gt;. It is important to remember that ideas do not
    always result in a direct code contribution, but deserve acknowledgement
    just the same. Time and time again the seemingly most insignificant
    questions and suggestions have been shown to catalyze monumental
    improvements in consistency, accuracy and performance.</p>
