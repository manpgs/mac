<p class="Pp">Handles the installing and uninstalling of perl modules, scripts,
    man pages, etc...</p>
<p class="Pp">Both <b>install()</b> and <b>uninstall()</b> are specific to the
    way ExtUtils::MakeMaker handles the installation and deinstallation of perl
    modules. They are not designed as general purpose tools.</p>
<p class="Pp">On some operating systems such as Win32 installation may not be
    possible until after a reboot has occurred. This can have varying
    consequences: removing an old DLL does not impact programs using the new
    one, but if a new DLL cannot be installed properly until reboot then
    anything depending on it must wait. The package variable</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $ExtUtils::Install::MUST_REBOOT
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is used to store this status.</p>
<p class="Pp">If this variable is true then such an operation has occurred and
    anything depending on this module cannot proceed until a reboot has
    occurred.</p>
<p class="Pp">If this value is defined but false then such an operation has
    ocurred, but should not impact later operations.</p>

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Copies each directory tree of <span class="Li">%from_to</span>
        to its corresponding value preserving timestamps and permissions.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There are two keys with a special meaning in the hash:
        &quot;read&quot; and &quot;write&quot;. These contain packlist files.
        After the copying is done, <b>install()</b> will write the list of
        target files to <span class="Li">$from_to</span>{write}. If
        <span class="Li">$from_to</span>{read} is given the contents of this
        file will be merged into the written file. The read and the written file
        may be identical, but on AFS it is quite likely that people are
        installing to a different directory than the one where the files later
        appear.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">$verbose</span> is true, will print out
        each file removed. Default is false. This is &quot;make install
        VERBINST=1&quot;. <span class="Li">$verbose</span> values going up to 5
        show increasingly more diagnostics output.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">$dry_run</span> is true it will only print
        what it was going to do without actually doing it. Default is false.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">$uninstall_shadows</span> is true any
        differing versions throughout <span class="Li">@INC</span> will be
        uninstalled. This is &quot;make install UNINST=1&quot;</p>
    <p class="Pp">As of 1.37_02 <b>install()</b> supports the use of a list of
        patterns to filter out files that shouldn't be installed. If
        <span class="Li">$skip</span> is omitted or undefined then install will
        try to read the list from INSTALL.SKIP in the CWD. This file is a list
        of regular expressions and is just like the MANIFEST.SKIP file used by
        ExtUtils::Manifest.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A default site INSTALL.SKIP may be provided by setting then
        environment variable EU_INSTALL_SITE_SKIPFILE, this will only be used
        when there isn't a distribution specific INSTALL.SKIP. If the
        environment variable EU_INSTALL_IGNORE_SKIP is true then no install file
        filtering will be performed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">$skip</span> is undefined then the skip
        file will be autodetected and used if it is found. If
        <span class="Li">$skip</span> is a reference to an array then it is
        assumed the array contains the list of patterns, if
        <span class="Li">$skip</span> is a true non reference it is assumed to
        be the filename holding the list of patterns, any other value of
        <span class="Li">$skip</span> is taken to mean that no install filtering
        should occur.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Changes As of Version 1.47</b></p>
    <p class="Pp">As of version 1.47 the following additions were made to the
        install interface. Note that the new argument style and use of the
        <span class="Li">%result</span> hash is recommended.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$always_copy</span> parameter which when
        true causes files to be updated regardless as to whether they have
        changed, if it is defined but false then copies are made only if the
        files have changed, if it is undefined then the value of the environment
        variable EU_INSTALL_ALWAYS_COPY is used as default.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">%result</span> hash will be populated
        with the various keys/subhashes reflecting the install. Currently these
        keys and their structure are:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    install             =&gt; { $target    =&gt; $source },
    install_fail        =&gt; { $target    =&gt; $source },
    install_unchanged   =&gt; { $target    =&gt; $source },
    install_filtered    =&gt; { $source    =&gt; $pattern },
    uninstall           =&gt; { $uninstalled =&gt; $source },
    uninstall_fail      =&gt; { $uninstalled =&gt; $source },
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">where <span class="Li">$source</span> is the filespec of the
        file being installed. <span class="Li">$target</span> is where it is
        being installed to, and <span class="Li">$uninstalled</span> is any
        shadow file that is in <span class="Li">@INC</span> or
        <span class="Li">$ENV{PERL5LIB}</span> or other standard locations, and
        <span class="Li">$pattern</span> is the pattern that caused a source
        file to be skipped. In future more keys will be added, such as to show
        created directories, however this requires changes in other modules and
        must therefore wait.</p>
    <p class="Pp">These keys will be populated before any exceptions are thrown
        should there be an error.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that all updates of the <span class="Li">%result</span>
        are additive, the hash will not be cleared before use, thus allowing
        status results of many installs to be easily aggregated.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>NEW ARGUMENT STYLE</b></p>
    <p class="Pp">If there is only one argument and it is a reference to an
        array then the array is assumed to contain a list of key-value pairs
        specifying the options. In this case the option &quot;from_to&quot; is
        mandatory. This style means that you do not have to supply a cryptic
        list of arguments and can use a self documenting argument list that is
        easier to understand.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is now the recommended interface to <b>install()</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>RETURN</b></p>
    <p class="Pp">If all actions were successful install will return a hashref
        of the results as described above for the
        <span class="Li">$result</span> parameter. If any action is a failure
        then install will die, therefore it is recommended to pass in the
        <span class="Li">$result</span> parameter instead of using the return
        value. If the result parameter is provided then the returned hashref
        will be the passed in hashref.</p>

    <pre>    install_default();

        blib/ to the default site installation location.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$fullext</span> is the name of the module
        converted to a directory (ie. Foo::Bar would be Foo/Bar). If
        <span class="Li">$fullext</span> is not specified, it will attempt to
        read it from <span class="Li">@ARGV</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is primarily useful for install scripts.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b> This function is not really useful because of the
        hard-coded install location with no way to control site vs core vs
        vendor directories and the strange way in which the module name is
        given. Consider its use discouraged.</p>

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Copies each key of <span class="Li">%from_to</span> to its
        corresponding value efficiently. If an
        <span class="Li">$autosplit_dir</span> is provided, all .pm files will
        be autosplit into it. Any destination directories are created.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$filter_cmd</span> is an optional shell
        command to run each .pm file through prior to splitting and copying.
        Input is the contents of the module, output the new module contents.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can have an environment variable PERL_INSTALL_ROOT set
        which will be prepended as a directory to each installed file (and
        directory).</p>
    <p class="Pp">By default verbose output is generated, setting the
        PERL_INSTALL_QUIET environment variable will silence this output.</p>
