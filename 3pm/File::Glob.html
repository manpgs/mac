<p class="Pp">The glob angle-bracket operator
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> is a pathname generator that
    implements the rules for file name pattern matching used by Unix-like shells
    such as the Bourne shell or C shell.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>File::Glob::bsd_glob()</b> implements the FreeBSD
    <b>glob</b>(3) routine, which is a superset of the POSIX <b>glob()</b>
    (described in IEEE Std 1003.2 &quot;POSIX.2&quot;). <b>bsd_glob()</b> takes
    a mandatory <span class="Li">&quot;pattern&quot;</span> argument, and an
    optional <span class="Li">&quot;flags&quot;</span> argument, and returns a
    list of filenames matching the pattern, with interpretation of the pattern
    modified by the <span class="Li">&quot;flags&quot;</span> variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since v5.6.0, Perl's <b>CORE::glob()</b> is implemented in terms
    of <b>bsd_glob()</b>. Note that they don't share the same
    prototype--<b>CORE::glob()</b> only accepts a single argument. Due to
    historical reasons, <b>CORE::glob()</b> will also split its argument on
    whitespace, treating it as multiple patterns, whereas <b>bsd_glob()</b>
    considers them as one pattern. But see
    <span class="Li">&quot;:bsd_glob&quot;</span> under &quot;EXPORTS&quot;,
    below.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">META CHARACTERS</h2>
<pre>
  \       Quote the next metacharacter
  []      Character class
  {}      Multiple pattern
  *       Match any string of characters
  ?       Match any single character
  ~       User name home directory
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The metanotation <span class="Li">&quot;a{b,c,d}e&quot;</span> is
    a shorthand for <span class="Li">&quot;abe ace ade&quot;</span>. Left to
    right order is preserved, with results of matches being sorted separately at
    a low level to preserve this order. As a special case
    <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;}&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;{}&quot;</span> are passed undisturbed.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">EXPORTS</h2>
<p class="Pp">See also the &quot;POSIX FLAGS&quot; below, which can be exported
    individually.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>&quot;:bsd_glob&quot;</i><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;:bsd_glob&quot;</span> export tag
    exports <b>bsd_glob()</b> and the constants listed below. It also overrides
    <b>glob()</b> in the calling package with one that behaves like
    <b>bsd_glob()</b> with regard to spaces (the space is treated as part of a
    file name), but supports iteration in scalar context; i.e., it preserves the
    core function's feature of returning the next item each time it is
  called.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>&quot;:glob&quot;</i><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;:glob&quot;</span> tag, now
    discouraged, is the old version of
    <span class="Li">&quot;:bsd_glob&quot;</span>. It exports the same constants
    and functions, but its <b>glob()</b> override does not support iteration; it
    returns the last file name in scalar context. That means this will loop
    forever:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use File::Glob ':glob';
    while (my $file = &lt;* copy.txt&gt;) {
        ...
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>&quot;bsd_glob&quot;</i><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">This function, which is included in the two export tags listed
    above, takes one or two arguments. The first is the glob pattern. The
    second, if given, is a set of flags ORed together. The available flags and
    the default set of flags are listed below under &quot;POSIX FLAGS&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Remember that to use the named constants for flags you must import
    them, for example with <span class="Li">&quot;:bsd_glob&quot;</span>
    described above. If not imported, and <span class="Li">&quot;use
    strict&quot;</span> is not in effect, then the constants will be treated as
    bareword strings, which won't do what you what.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>&quot;:nocase&quot;</i><i> and
    </i><i>&quot;:case&quot;</i><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">These two export tags globally modify the default flags that
    <b>bsd_glob()</b> and, except on VMS, Perl's built-in
    <span class="Li">&quot;glob&quot;</span> operator use.
    <span class="Li">&quot;GLOB_NOCASE&quot;</span> is turned on or off,
    respectively.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>&quot;csh_glob&quot;</i><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>csh_glob()</b> function can also be exported, but you
    should not use it directly unless you really know what you are doing. It
    splits the pattern into words and feeds each one to <b>bsd_glob()</b>.
    Perl's own <b>glob()</b> function uses this internally.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">POSIX FLAGS</h2>
<p class="Pp">If no flags argument is give then
    <span class="Li">&quot;GLOB_CSH&quot;</span> is set, and on VMS and Windows
    systems, <span class="Li">&quot;GLOB_NOCASE&quot;</span> too. Otherwise the
    flags to use are determined solely by the flags argument. The POSIX defined
    flags are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;GLOB_ERR&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Force <b>bsd_glob()</b> to return an error when it encounters a directory
      it cannot open or read. Ordinarily <b>bsd_glob()</b> continues to find
      matches.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;GLOB_LIMIT&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Make <b>bsd_glob()</b> return an error (GLOB_NOSPACE) when the pattern
      expands to a size bigger than the system constant
      <span class="Li">&quot;ARG_MAX&quot;</span> (usually found in limits.h).
      If your system does not define this constant, <b>bsd_glob()</b> uses
      <span class="Li">&quot;sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX)&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;_POSIX_ARG_MAX&quot;</span> where available (in
      that order). You can inspect these values using the standard
      <span class="Li">&quot;POSIX&quot;</span> extension.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;GLOB_MARK&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Each pathname that is a directory that matches the pattern has a slash
      appended.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;GLOB_NOCASE&quot;</dt>
  <dd>By default, file names are assumed to be case sensitive; this flag makes
      <b>bsd_glob()</b> treat case differences as not significant.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;GLOB_NOCHECK&quot;</dt>
  <dd>If the pattern does not match any pathname, then <b>bsd_glob()</b> returns
      a list consisting of only the pattern. If
      <span class="Li">&quot;GLOB_QUOTE&quot;</span> is set, its effect is
      present in the pattern returned.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;GLOB_NOSORT&quot;</dt>
  <dd>By default, the pathnames are sorted in ascending ASCII order; this flag
      prevents that sorting (speeding up <b>bsd_glob()</b>).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The FreeBSD extensions to the POSIX standard are the following
    flags:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;GLOB_BRACE&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Pre-process the string to expand
      <span class="Li">&quot;{pat,pat,...}&quot;</span> strings like
      <b>csh</b>(1). The pattern '{}' is left unexpanded for historical reasons
      (and <b>csh</b>(1) does the same thing to ease typing of <b>find</b>(1)
      patterns).</dd>
  <dt>&quot;GLOB_NOMAGIC&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Same as <span class="Li">&quot;GLOB_NOCHECK&quot;</span> but it only
      returns the pattern if it does not contain any of the special characters
      &quot;*&quot;, &quot;?&quot; or &quot;[&quot;.
      <span class="Li">&quot;NOMAGIC&quot;</span> is provided to simplify
      implementing the historic <b>csh</b>(1) globbing behaviour and should
      probably not be used anywhere else.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;GLOB_QUOTE&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Use the backslash ('\') character for quoting: every occurrence of a
      backslash followed by a character in the pattern is replaced by that
      character, avoiding any special interpretation of the character. (But see
      below for exceptions on DOSISH systems).</dd>
  <dt>&quot;GLOB_TILDE&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Expand patterns that start with '~' to user name home directories.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;GLOB_CSH&quot;</dt>
  <dd>For convenience, <span class="Li">&quot;GLOB_CSH&quot;</span> is a synonym
      for <span class="Li">&quot;GLOB_BRACE | GLOB_NOMAGIC | GLOB_QUOTE |
      GLOB_TILDE | GLOB_ALPHASORT&quot;</span>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The POSIX provided
    <span class="Li">&quot;GLOB_APPEND&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;GLOB_DOOFFS&quot;</span>, and the FreeBSD extensions
    <span class="Li">&quot;GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;GLOB_MAGCHAR&quot;</span> flags have not been
    implemented in the Perl version because they involve more complex
    interaction with the underlying C structures.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following flag has been added in the Perl implementation for
    csh compatibility:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;GLOB_ALPHASORT&quot;</dt>
  <dd>If <span class="Li">&quot;GLOB_NOSORT&quot;</span> is not in effect, sort
      filenames is alphabetical order (case does not matter) rather than in
      ASCII order.</dd>

<p class="Pp"><b>bsd_glob()</b> returns a list of matching paths, possibly zero
    length. If an error occurred, &amp;File::Glob::GLOB_ERROR will be non-zero
    and <span class="Li">$!</span> will be set. &amp;File::Glob::GLOB_ERROR is
    guaranteed to be zero if no error occurred, or one of the following values
    otherwise:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;GLOB_NOSPACE&quot;</dt>
  <dd>An attempt to allocate memory failed.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;GLOB_ABEND&quot;</dt>
  <dd>The glob was stopped because an error was encountered.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In the case where <b>bsd_glob()</b> has found some matching paths,
    but is interrupted by an error, it will return a list of filenames
    <b>and</b> set &amp;File::Glob::ERROR.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that <b>bsd_glob()</b> deviates from POSIX and FreeBSD
    <b>glob</b>(3) behaviour by not considering
    <span class="Li">&quot;ENOENT&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;ENOTDIR&quot;</span> as errors - <b>bsd_glob()</b>
    will continue processing despite those errors, unless the
    <span class="Li">&quot;GLOB_ERR&quot;</span> flag is set.</p>
<p class="Pp">Be aware that all filenames returned from File::Glob are
  tainted.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>If you want to use multiple patterns, e.g.
      <span class="Li">&quot;bsd_glob(&quot;a* b*&quot;)&quot;</span>, you
      should probably throw them in a set as in
      <span class="Li">&quot;bsd_glob(&quot;{a*,b*}&quot;)&quot;</span>. This is
      because the argument to <b>bsd_glob()</b> isn't subjected to parsing by
      the C shell. Remember that you can use a backslash to escape things.</li>
  <li>On DOSISH systems, backslash is a valid directory separator character. In
      this case, use of backslash as a quoting character (via GLOB_QUOTE)
      interferes with the use of backslash as a directory separator. The best
      (simplest, most portable) solution is to use forward slashes for directory
      separators, and backslashes for quoting. However, this does not match
      &quot;normal practice&quot; on these systems. As a concession to user
      expectation, therefore, backslashes (under GLOB_QUOTE) only quote the glob
      metacharacters '[', ']', '{', '}', '-', '~', and backslash itself. All
      other backslashes are passed through unchanged.</li>
  <li>Win32 users should use the real slash. If you really want to use
      backslashes, consider using Sarathy's File::DosGlob, which comes with the
      standard Perl distribution.</li>
