<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;IO::Tty&quot;</span> is used internally by
    <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Pty&quot;</span> to create a pseudo-tty. You
    wouldn't want to use it directly except to import constants, use
    <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Pty&quot;</span>. For a list of importable
    constants, see IO::Tty::Constant.</p>
<p class="Pp">Windows is now supported, but ONLY under the Cygwin environment,
    see &lt;http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Please note that pty creation is very system-dependend. From my
    experience, any modern POSIX system should be fine. Find below a list of
    systems that <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Tty&quot;</span> should work on. A
    more detailed table (which is slowly getting out-of-date) is available from
    the project pages document manager at SourceForge
    &lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/expectperl/&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you have problems on your system and your system is listed in
    the &quot;verified&quot; list, you probably have some non-standard setup,
    e.g. you compiled your Linux-kernel yourself and disabled ptys (bummer!).
    Please ask your friendly sysadmin for help.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your system is not listed, unpack the latest version of
    <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Tty&quot;</span>, do a <span class="Li">'perl
    Makefile.PL; make; make test; uname -a'</span> and send me
    (<i>RGiersig@cpan.org</i>) the results and I'll see what I can deduce from
    that. There are chances that it will work right out-of-the-box...</p>
<p class="Pp">If it's working on your system, please send me a short note with
    details (version number, distribution, etc. 'uname -a' and 'perl -V' is a
    good start; also, the output from &quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot; contains a
    lot of interesting info, so please include that as well) so I can get an
    overview. Thanks!</p>

  SYSTEMS, KNOWN ISSUES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This is a list of systems that
    <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Tty&quot;</span> seems to work on ('make test'
    passes) with comments about &quot;features&quot;:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>AIX 4.3
    <p class="Pp">Returns EIO instead of EOF when the slave is closed.
      Benign.</p>
  </li>
  <li>AIX 5.x</li>
  <li>FreeBSD 4.4
    <p class="Pp">EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.</p>
  </li>
  <li>OpenBSD 2.8
    <p class="Pp">The ioctl TIOCSCTTY sometimes fails. This is also known in
        Tcl/Expect, see http://expect.nist.gov/FAQ.html</p>
    <p class="Pp">EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Darwin 7.9.0</li>
  <li>HPUX 10.20 &amp; 11.00
    <p class="Pp">EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.</p>
  </li>
  <li>IRIX 6.5</li>
  <li>Linux 2.2.x &amp; 2.4.x

      Benign.</p>
  </li>
  <li>OSF 4.0
    <p class="Pp">EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Solaris 8, 2.7, 2.6
    <p class="Pp">Has the &quot;feature&quot; of returning EOF just once?!</p>
    <p class="Pp">EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Windows NT/2k/XP (under Cygwin)
    <p class="Pp">When you send (print) a too long line (&gt;160 chars) to a
        non-raw pty, the call just hangs forever and even <i>alarm()</i> cannot
        get you out. Don't complain to me...</p>
    <p class="Pp">EOF on the slave tty is not reported back to the master.</p>
  </li>
  <li>z/OS</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The following systems have not been verified yet for this version,
    but a previous version worked on them:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>SCO Unix</li>
  <li>NetBSD
    <p class="Pp">probably the same as the other *BSDs...</p>
