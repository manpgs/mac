<p class="Pp">This module has two interfaces, one through <b>color()</b> and
    <b>colored()</b> and the other through constants. It also offers the utility
    functions <b>uncolor()</b>, <b>colorstrip()</b>, <b>colorvalid()</b>, and
    <b>coloralias()</b>, which have to be explicitly imported to be used (see
    &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are using Term::ANSIColor in a console command, consider
    supporting the CLICOLOR standard. See &quot;Supporting CLICOLOR&quot; for
    more information.</p>
<p class="Pp">See &quot;COMPATIBILITY&quot; for the versions of Term::ANSIColor
    that introduced particular features and the versions of Perl that included
    them.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Supported_Colors"><a class="permalink" href="#Supported_Colors">Supported
  Colors</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Terminal emulators that support color divide into four types: ones
    that support only eight colors, ones that support sixteen, ones that support
    256, and ones that support 24-bit color. This module provides the ANSI
    escape codes for all of them. These colors are referred to as ANSI colors 0
    through 7 (normal), 8 through 15 (16-color), 16 through 255 (256-color), and
    true color (called direct-color by <b>xterm</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Unfortunately, interpretation of colors 0 through 7 often depends
    on whether the emulator supports eight colors or sixteen colors. Emulators
    that only support eight colors (such as the Linux console) will display
    colors 0 through 7 with normal brightness and ignore colors 8 through 15,
    treating them the same as white. Emulators that support 16 colors, such as
    gnome-terminal, normally display colors 0 through 7 as dim or darker
    versions and colors 8 through 15 as normal brightness. On such emulators,
    the &quot;normal&quot; white (color 7) usually is shown as pale grey,
    requiring bright white (15) to be used to get a real white color. Bright
    black usually is a dark grey color, although some terminals display it as
    pure black. Some sixteen-color terminal emulators also treat normal yellow
    (color 3) as orange or brown, and bright yellow (color 11) as yellow.</p>
<p class="Pp">Following the normal convention of sixteen-color emulators, this
    module provides a pair of attributes for each color. For every normal color
    (0 through 7), the corresponding bright color (8 through 15) is obtained by
    prepending the string <span class="Li">&quot;bright_&quot;</span> to the
    normal color name. For example, <span class="Li">&quot;red&quot;</span> is
    color 1 and <span class="Li">&quot;bright_red&quot;</span> is color 9. The
    same applies for background colors:
    <span class="Li">&quot;on_red&quot;</span> is the normal color and
    <span class="Li">&quot;on_bright_red&quot;</span> is the bright color.
    Capitalize these strings for the constant interface.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is unfortunately no way to know whether the current emulator
    supports more than eight colors, which makes the choice of colors difficult.
    The most conservative choice is to use only the regular colors, which are at
    least displayed on all emulators. However, they will appear dark in
    sixteen-color terminal emulators, including most common emulators in UNIX X
    environments. If you know the display is one of those emulators, you may
    wish to use the bright variants instead. Even better, offer the user a way
    to configure the colors for a given application to fit their terminal
    emulator.</p>
<p class="Pp">For 256-color emulators, this module additionally provides
    <span class="Li">&quot;ansi0&quot;</span> through
    <span class="Li">&quot;ansi15&quot;</span>, which are the same as colors 0
    through 15 in sixteen-color emulators but use the 256-color escape syntax,
    <span class="Li">&quot;grey0&quot;</span> through
    <span class="Li">&quot;grey23&quot;</span> ranging from nearly black to
    nearly white, and a set of RGB colors. The RGB colors are of the form
    <span class="Li">&quot;rgb</span><span class="Li"><i>RGB</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    where <i>R</i>, <i>G</i>, and <i>B</i> are numbers from 0 to 5 giving the
    intensity of red, green, and blue. The grey and RGB colors are also
    available as <span class="Li">&quot;ansi16&quot;</span> through
    <span class="Li">&quot;ansi255&quot;</span> if you want simple names for all
    256 colors. <span class="Li">&quot;on_&quot;</span> variants of all of these
    colors are also provided. These colors may be ignored completely on
    non-256-color terminals or may be misinterpreted and produce random
    behavior. Additional attributes such as blink, italic, or bold may not work
    with the 256-color palette.</p>
<p class="Pp">For true color emulators, this module supports attributes of the
    form
    <span class="Li">&quot;r</span><span class="Li"><i>NNN</i></span><span class="Li">g</span><span class="Li"><i>NNN</i></span><span class="Li">b</span><span class="Li"><i>NNN</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    and
    <span class="Li">&quot;on_r</span><span class="Li"><i>NNN</i></span><span class="Li">g</span><span class="Li"><i>NNN</i></span><span class="Li">b</span><span class="Li"><i>NNN</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    for all values of <i>NNN</i> between 0 and 255. These represent foreground
    and background colors, respectively, with the RGB values given by the
    <i>NNN</i> numbers. These colors may be ignored completely on non-true-color
    terminals or may be misinterpreted and produce random behavior.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Function_Interface"><a class="permalink" href="#Function_Interface">Function
  Interface</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The function interface uses attribute strings to describe the
    colors and text attributes to assign to text. The recognized non-color
    attributes are clear, reset, bold, dark, faint, italic, underline,
    underscore, blink, reverse, and concealed. Clear and reset (reset to default
    attributes), dark and faint (dim and saturated), and underline and
    underscore are equivalent, so use whichever is the most intuitive to
  you.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that not all attributes are supported by all terminal types,
    and some terminals may not support any of these sequences. Dark and faint,
    italic, blink, and concealed in particular are frequently not
  implemented.</p>
<p class="Pp">The recognized normal foreground color attributes (colors 0 to 7)
    are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  black  red  green  yellow  blue  magenta  cyan  white
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The corresponding bright foreground color attributes (colors 8 to
    15) are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  bright_black  bright_red      bright_green  bright_yellow
  bright_blue   bright_magenta  bright_cyan   bright_white
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The recognized normal background color attributes (colors 0 to 7)
    are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  on_black  on_red      on_green  on yellow
  on_blue   on_magenta  on_cyan   on_white
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The recognized bright background color attributes (colors 8 to 15)
    are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  on_bright_black  on_bright_red      on_bright_green  on_bright_yellow
  on_bright_blue   on_bright_magenta  on_bright_cyan   on_bright_white
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For 256-color terminals, the recognized foreground colors are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  ansi0 .. ansi255
  grey0 .. grey23
</pre>
<p class="Pp">plus
    <span class="Li">&quot;rgb</span><span class="Li"><i>RGB</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    for <i>R</i>, <i>G</i>, and <i>B</i> values from 0 to 5, such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;rgb000&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;rgb515&quot;</span>. Similarly, the recognized
    background colors are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  on_ansi0 .. on_ansi255
  on_grey0 .. on_grey23
</pre>
<p class="Pp">plus
    <span class="Li">&quot;on_rgb</span><span class="Li"><i>RGB</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    for <i>R</i>, <i>G</i>, and <i>B</i> values from 0 to 5.</p>
<p class="Pp">For true color terminals, the recognized foreground colors are
    <span class="Li">&quot;r</span><span class="Li"><i>RRR</i></span><span class="Li">g</span><span class="Li"><i>GGG</i></span><span class="Li">b</span><span class="Li"><i>BBB</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    for <i>RRR</i>, <i>GGG</i>, and <i>BBB</i> values between 0 and 255.
    Similarly, the recognized background colors are
    <span class="Li">&quot;on_r</span><span class="Li"><i>RRR</i></span><span class="Li">g</span><span class="Li"><i>GGG</i></span><span class="Li">b</span><span class="Li"><i>BBB</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    for <i>RRR</i>, <i>GGG</i>, and <i>BBB</i> values between 0 and 255.</p>
<p class="Pp">For any of the above listed attributes, case is not
  significant.</p>
<p class="Pp">Attributes, once set, last until they are unset (by printing the
    attribute <span class="Li">&quot;clear&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;reset&quot;</span>). Be careful to do this, or
    otherwise your attribute will last after your script is done running, and
    people get very annoyed at having their prompt and typing changed to weird
    colors.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="color(ATTR_,"><a class="permalink" href="#color(ATTR_,">color(ATTR[,
    ATTR ...])</a></dt>
  <dd><b>color()</b> takes any number of strings as arguments and considers them
      to be space-separated lists of attributes. It then forms and returns the
      escape sequence to set those attributes. It doesn't print it out, just
      returns it, so you'll have to print it yourself if you want to. This is so
      that you can save it as a string, pass it to something else, send it to a
      file handle, or do anything else with it that you might care to.
      <b>color()</b> throws an exception if given an invalid attribute.</dd>
  <dt id="colored("><a class="permalink" href="#colored(">colored(STRING, ATTR[,
    ATTR ...])</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="colored(~2"><a class="permalink" href="#colored(~2">colored(ATTR-REF,
    STRING[, STRING...])</a></dt>
  <dd>As an aid in resetting colors, <b>colored()</b> takes a scalar as the
      first argument and any number of attribute strings as the second argument
      and returns the scalar wrapped in escape codes so that the attributes will
      be set as requested before the string and reset to normal after the
      string. Alternately, you can pass a reference to an array as the first
      argument, and then the contents of that array will be taken as attributes
      and color codes and the remainder of the arguments as text to colorize.
    <p class="Pp">Normally, <b>colored()</b> just puts attribute codes at the
        beginning and end of the string, but if you set
        <span class="Li">$Term::ANSIColor::EACHLINE</span> to some string, that
        string will be considered the line delimiter and the attribute will be
        set at the beginning of each line of the passed string and reset at the
        end of each line. This is often desirable if the output contains
        newlines and you're using background colors, since a background color
        that persists across a newline is often interpreted by the terminal as
        providing the default background color for the next line. Programs like
        pagers can also be confused by attributes that span lines. Normally
        you'll want to set <span class="Li">$Term::ANSIColor::EACHLINE</span> to
        <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> to use this feature.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Particularly consider setting
        <span class="Li">$Term::ANSIColor::EACHLINE</span> if you are
        interleaving output to standard output and standard error and you aren't
        flushing standard output (via <b>autoflush()</b> or setting
        <span class="Li">$|</span>). If you don't, the code to reset the color
        may unexpectedly sit in the standard output buffer rather than going to
        the display, causing standard error output to appear in the wrong
      color.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="uncolor("><a class="permalink" href="#uncolor(">uncolor(ESCAPE)</a></dt>
  <dd><b>uncolor()</b> performs the opposite translation as <b>color()</b>,
      turning escape sequences into a list of strings corresponding to the
      attributes being set by those sequences. <b>uncolor()</b> will never
      return <span class="Li">&quot;ansi16&quot;</span> through
      <span class="Li">&quot;ansi255&quot;</span>, instead preferring the
      <span class="Li">&quot;grey&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;rgb&quot;</span> names (and likewise for
      <span class="Li">&quot;on_ansi16&quot;</span> through
      <span class="Li">&quot;on_ansi255&quot;</span>).</dd>
  <dt id="colorstrip(STRING_,"><a class="permalink" href="#colorstrip(STRING_,">colorstrip(STRING[,
    STRING ...])</a></dt>
  <dd><b>colorstrip()</b> removes all color escape sequences from the provided
      strings, returning the modified strings separately in array context or
      joined together in scalar context. Its arguments are not modified.</dd>
  <dt id="colorvalid(ATTR_,"><a class="permalink" href="#colorvalid(ATTR_,">colorvalid(ATTR[,
    ATTR ...])</a></dt>
  <dd><b>colorvalid()</b> takes attribute strings the same as <b>color()</b> and
      returns true if all attributes are known and false otherwise.</dd>
  <dt id="coloralias(ALIAS_,"><a class="permalink" href="#coloralias(ALIAS_,">coloralias(ALIAS[,
    ATTR ...])</a></dt>
  <dd>If ATTR is specified, it is interpreted as a list of space-separated
      strings naming attributes or existing aliases. In this case,
      <b>coloralias()</b> sets up an alias of ALIAS for the set of attributes
      given by ATTR. From that point forward, ALIAS can be passed into
      <b>color()</b>, <b>colored()</b>, and <b>colorvalid()</b> and will have
      the same meaning as the sequence of attributes given in ATTR. One possible
      use of this facility is to give more meaningful names to the 256-color RGB
      colors. Only ASCII alphanumerics, <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;_&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span> are allowed in alias names.
    <p class="Pp">If ATTR includes aliases, those aliases will be expanded at
        definition time and their values will be used to define the new alias.
        This means that if you define an alias A in terms of another alias B,
        and then later redefine alias B, the value of alias A will not
      change.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If ATTR is not specified, <b>coloralias()</b> returns the
        standard attribute or attributes to which ALIAS is aliased, if any, or
        undef if ALIAS does not exist. If it is aliased to multiple attributes,
        the return value will be a single string and the attributes will be
        separated by spaces.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is the same facility used by the ANSI_COLORS_ALIASES
        environment variable (see &quot;ENVIRONMENT&quot; below) but can be used
        at runtime, not just when the module is loaded.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Later invocations of <b>coloralias()</b> with the same ALIAS
        will override earlier aliases. There is no way to remove an alias.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Aliases have no effect on the return value of
        <b>uncolor()</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>: Aliases are global and affect all callers in
        the same process. There is no way to set an alias limited to a
        particular block of code or a particular object.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Constant_Interface"><a class="permalink" href="#Constant_Interface">Constant
  Interface</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Alternately, if you import
    <span class="Li">&quot;:constants&quot;</span>, you can use the following
    constants directly:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  CLEAR           RESET             BOLD            DARK
  FAINT           ITALIC            UNDERLINE       UNDERSCORE
  BLINK           REVERSE           CONCEALED
  BLACK           RED               GREEN           YELLOW
  BLUE            MAGENTA           CYAN            WHITE
  BRIGHT_BLACK    BRIGHT_RED        BRIGHT_GREEN    BRIGHT_YELLOW
  BRIGHT_BLUE     BRIGHT_MAGENTA    BRIGHT_CYAN     BRIGHT_WHITE
  ON_BLACK        ON_RED            ON_GREEN        ON_YELLOW
  ON_BLUE         ON_MAGENTA        ON_CYAN         ON_WHITE
  ON_BRIGHT_BLACK ON_BRIGHT_RED     ON_BRIGHT_GREEN ON_BRIGHT_YELLOW
  ON_BRIGHT_BLUE  ON_BRIGHT_MAGENTA ON_BRIGHT_CYAN  ON_BRIGHT_WHITE
</pre>
<p class="Pp">These are the same as color('attribute') and can be used if you
    prefer typing:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print BOLD BLUE ON_WHITE &quot;Text&quot;, RESET, &quot;\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print colored (&quot;Text&quot;, 'bold blue on_white'), &quot;\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(Note that the newline is kept separate to avoid confusing the
    terminal as described above since a background color is being used.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If you import <span class="Li">&quot;:constants256&quot;</span>,
    you can use the following constants directly:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  ANSI0 .. ANSI255
  GREY0 .. GREY23
  RGBXYZ (for X, Y, and Z values from 0 to 5, like RGB000 or RGB515)
  ON_ANSI0 .. ON_ANSI255
  ON_GREY0 .. ON_GREY23
  ON_RGBXYZ (for X, Y, and Z values from 0 to 5)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that <span class="Li">&quot;:constants256&quot;</span> does
    not include the other constants, so if you want to mix both, you need to
    include <span class="Li">&quot;:constants&quot;</span> as well. You may want
    to explicitly import at least <span class="Li">&quot;RESET&quot;</span>, as
    in:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use Term::ANSIColor 4.00 qw(RESET :constants256);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">True color and aliases are not supported by the constant
    interface.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using the constants, if you don't want to have to remember to
    add the <span class="Li">&quot;, RESET&quot;</span> at the end of each print
    line, you can set <span class="Li">$Term::ANSIColor::AUTORESET</span> to a
    true value. Then, the display mode will automatically be reset if there is
    no comma after the constant. In other words, with that variable set:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print BOLD BLUE &quot;Text\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will reset the display mode afterward, whereas:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print BOLD, BLUE, &quot;Text\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will not. If you are using background colors, you will probably
    want to either use <b>say()</b> (in newer versions of Perl) or print the
    newline with a separate print statement to avoid confusing the terminal.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">$Term::ANSIColor::AUTOLOCAL</span> is set (see
    below), it takes precedence over
    <span class="Li">$Term::ANSIColor::AUTORESET</span>, and the latter is
    ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">The subroutine interface has the advantage over the constants
    interface in that only two subroutines are exported into your namespace,
    versus thirty-eight in the constants interface, and aliases and true color
    attributes are supported. On the flip side, the constants interface has the
    advantage of better compile time error checking, since misspelled names of
    colors or attributes in calls to <b>color()</b> and <b>colored()</b> won't
    be caught until runtime whereas misspelled names of constants will be caught
    at compile time. So, pollute your namespace with almost two dozen
    subroutines that you may not even use that often, or risk a silly bug by
    mistyping an attribute. Your choice, TMTOWTDI after all.</p>

<p class="Pp">You can import <span class="Li">&quot;:pushpop&quot;</span> and
    maintain a stack of colors using PUSHCOLOR, POPCOLOR, and LOCALCOLOR.
    PUSHCOLOR takes the attribute string that starts its argument and pushes it
    onto a stack of attributes. POPCOLOR removes the top of the stack and
    restores the previous attributes set by the argument of a prior PUSHCOLOR.
    LOCALCOLOR surrounds its argument in a PUSHCOLOR and POPCOLOR so that the
    color resets afterward.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">$Term::ANSIColor::AUTOLOCAL</span> is set,
    each sequence of color constants will be implicitly preceded by LOCALCOLOR.
    In other words, the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    {
        local $Term::ANSIColor::AUTOLOCAL = 1;
        print BLUE &quot;Text\n&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is equivalent to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print LOCALCOLOR BLUE &quot;Text\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">$Term::ANSIColor::AUTOLOCAL</span> is set, it
    takes precedence over <span class="Li">$Term::ANSIColor::AUTORESET</span>,
    and the latter is ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using PUSHCOLOR, POPCOLOR, and LOCALCOLOR, it's particularly
    important to not put commas between the constants.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print PUSHCOLOR BLUE &quot;Text\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will correctly push BLUE onto the top of the stack.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print PUSHCOLOR, BLUE, &quot;Text\n&quot;;    # wrong!
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will not, and a subsequent pop won't restore the correct
    attributes. PUSHCOLOR pushes the attributes set by its argument, which is
    normally a string of color constants. It can't ask the terminal what the
    current attributes are.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Supporting_"><a class="permalink" href="#Supporting_">Supporting
  CLICOLOR</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">&lt;https://bixense.com/clicolors/&gt; proposes a standard for
    enabling and disabling color output from console commands using two
    environment variables, CLICOLOR and CLICOLOR_FORCE. Term::ANSIColor cannot
    automatically support this standard, since the correct action depends on
    where the output is going and Term::ANSIColor may be used in a context where
    colors should always be generated even if CLICOLOR is set in the
    environment. But you can use the supported environment variable
    ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED to implement CLICOLOR in your own programs with code
    like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    if (exists($ENV{CLICOLOR}) &amp;&amp; $ENV{CLICOLOR} == 0) {
        if (!$ENV{CLICOLOR_FORCE}) {
            $ENV{ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED} = 1;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you are using the constant interface, be sure to include this
    code before you use any color constants (such as at the very top of your
    script), since this environment variable is only honored the first time a
    color constant is seen.</p>
<p class="Pp">Be aware that this will export ANSI_COLORS_DISABLED to any child
    processes of your program as well.</p>

<p class="Pp">Both <b>colored()</b> and many uses of the color constants will
    add the reset escape sequence after a newline. If a program mixes colored
    output to standard output with output to standard error, this can result in
    the standard error text having the wrong color because the reset escape
    sequence hasn't yet been flushed to the display (since standard output to a
    terminal is line-buffered by default). To avoid this, either set
    <b>autoflush()</b> on STDOUT or set
    <span class="Li">$Term::ANSIColor::EACHLINE</span> to
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">It would be nice if one could leave off the commas around the
    constants entirely and just say:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print BOLD BLUE ON_WHITE &quot;Text\n&quot; RESET;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">but the syntax of Perl doesn't allow this. You need a comma after
    the string. (Of course, you may consider it a bug that commas between all
    the constants aren't required, in which case you may feel free to insert
    commas unless you're using
    <span class="Li">$Term::ANSIColor::AUTORESET</span> or
  PUSHCOLOR/POPCOLOR.)</p>
<p class="Pp">For easier debugging, you may prefer to always use the commas when
    not setting <span class="Li">$Term::ANSIColor::AUTORESET</span> or
    PUSHCOLOR/POPCOLOR so that you'll get a fatal compile error rather than a
    warning.</p>
<p class="Pp">It's not possible to use this module to embed formatting and color
    attributes using Perl formats. They replace the escape character with a
    space (as documented in <b>perlform</b>(1)), resulting in garbled output
    from the unrecognized attribute. Even if there were a way around that
    problem, the format doesn't know that the non-printing escape sequence is
    zero-length and would incorrectly format the output. For formatted output
    using color or other attributes, either use <b>sprintf()</b> instead or use
    <b>formline()</b> and then add the color or other attributes after
    formatting and before output.</p>

<p class="Pp">The codes generated by this module are standard terminal control

    (bold, dark, italic, underline, and reverse) are part of the earlier ANSI
    X3.64 standard for control sequences for video terminals and
  peripherals.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that not all displays are ISO 6429-compliant, or even
    X3.64-compliant (or are even attempting to be so). This module will not work
    as expected on displays that do not honor these escape sequences, such as
    cmd.exe, 4nt.exe, and command.com under either Windows NT or Windows 2000.
    They may just be ignored, or they may display as an ESC character followed

<p class="Pp">Jean Delvare provided the following table of different common
    terminal emulators and their support for the various attributes and others

<p class="Pp">Windows is Windows telnet, Cygwin SSH is the OpenSSH
    implementation under Cygwin on Windows NT, and Mac Terminal is the Terminal
    application in Mac OS X. Where the entry is other than yes or no, that
    emulator displays the given attribute as something else instead. Note that
    on an aixterm, clear doesn't reset colors; you have to explicitly set the
    colors back to what you want. More entries in this table are welcome.</p>
<p class="Pp">Support for code 3 (italic) is rare and therefore not mentioned in
    that table. It is not believed to be fully supported by any of the terminals
    listed, although it's displayed as green in the Linux console, but it is
    reportedly supported by urxvt.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that codes 6 (rapid blink) and 9 (strike-through) are
    specified in ANSI X3.64 and ECMA-048 but are not commonly supported by most
    displays and emulators and therefore aren't supported by this module.
    ECMA-048 also specifies a large number of other attributes, including a
    sequence of attributes for font changes, Fraktur characters,
    double-underlining, framing, circling, and overlining. As none of these
    attributes are widely supported or useful, they also aren't currently
    supported by this module.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most modern X terminal emulators support 256 colors. Known to not
    support those colors are aterm, rxvt, Terminal.app, and TTY/VC.</p>
