<p class="Pp">Here-docs are incredibly handy when writing Perl, but incredibly
    tricky when parsing it, primarily because they don't follow the general flow
    of input.</p>
<p class="Pp">They jump ahead and nab lines directly off the input buffer.
    Whitespace and newlines may not matter in most Perl code, but they matter in
    here-docs.</p>
<p class="Pp">They are also tricky to store as an object. They look sort of like
    an operator and a string, but they don't act like it. And they have a second
    section that should be something like a separate token, but isn't because a
    string can span from above the here-doc content to below it.</p>
<p class="Pp">So when parsing, this is what we do.</p>
<p class="Pp">Firstly, the PPI::Token::HereDoc object, does not represent the
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;</span> operator, or the
    &quot;END_FLAG&quot;, or the content, or even the terminator.</p>
<p class="Pp">It represents all of them at once.</p>
<p class="Pp">The token itself has only the declaration part as its
    &quot;content&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  # This is what the content of a HereDoc token is
  &lt;&lt;FOO
  
  # Or this
  &lt;&lt;&quot;FOO&quot;
  
  # Or even this
  &lt;&lt;      'FOO'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That is, the &quot;operator&quot;, any whitespace separator, and
    the quoted or bare terminator. So when you call the
    <span class="Li">&quot;content&quot;</span> method on a HereDoc token, you
    get '&lt;&lt; &quot;FOO&quot;'.</p>
<p class="Pp">As for the content and the terminator, when treated purely in
    &quot;content&quot; terms they do not exist.</p>
<p class="Pp">The content is made available with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;heredoc&quot;</span> method, and the name of the
    terminator with the <span class="Li">&quot;terminator&quot;</span>
  method.</p>
<p class="Pp">To make things work in the way you expect, PPI has to play some
    games when doing line/column location calculation for tokens, and also
    during the content parsing and generation processes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Documents cannot simply by recreated by stitching together the
    token contents, and involve a somewhat more expensive procedure, but the
    extra expense should be relatively negligible unless you are doing huge
    quantities of them.</p>
<p class="Pp">Please note that due to the immature nature of PPI in general, we
    expect <span class="Li">&quot;HereDocs&quot;</span> to be a rich (bad)
    source of corner-case bugs for quite a while, but for the most part they
    should more or less DWYM.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Comparison_to_other_string_types"><a class="permalink" href="#Comparison_to_other_string_types">Comparison
  to other string types</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Although technically it can be considered a quote, for the time
    being <span class="Li">&quot;HereDocs&quot;</span> are being treated as a
    completely separate <span class="Li">&quot;Token&quot;</span> subclass, and
    will not be found in a search for PPI::Token::Quote or PPI::Token::QuoteLike
    objects.</p>
<p class="Pp">This may change in the future, with it most likely to end up under
    QuoteLike.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="METHODS"><a class="permalink" href="#METHODS">METHODS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Although it has the standard set of
    <span class="Li">&quot;Token&quot;</span> methods,
    <span class="Li">&quot;HereDoc&quot;</span> objects have a relatively large
    number of unique methods all of their own.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="heredoc"><a class="permalink" href="#heredoc">heredoc</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;heredoc&quot;</span> method is the
    authoritative method for accessing the contents of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;HereDoc&quot;</span> object.</p>
<p class="Pp">It returns the contents of the here-doc as a list of
    newline-terminated strings. If called in scalar context, it returns the
    number of lines in the here-doc, <b>excluding</b> the terminator line.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="terminator"><a class="permalink" href="#terminator">terminator</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;terminator&quot;</span> method returns
    the name of the terminating string for the here-doc.</p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the terminating string as an unescaped string (in the rare
    case the terminator has an escaped quote in it).</p>
