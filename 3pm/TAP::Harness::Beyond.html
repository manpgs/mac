  make test</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Test::Harness is responsible for running test scripts, analysing
    their output and reporting success or failure. When I type <i>make test</i>
    (or <i>./Build test</i>) for a module, Test::Harness is usually used to run
    the tests (not all modules use Test::Harness but the majority do).</p>
<p class="Pp">To start exploring some of the features of Test::Harness I need to
    switch from <i>make test</i> to the <i>prove</i> command (which ships with
    Test::Harness). For the following examples I'll also need a recent version
    of Test::Harness installed; 3.14 is current as I write.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the examples I'm going to assume that we're working with a
    'normal' Perl module distribution. Specifically I'll assume that typing
    <i>make</i> or <i>./Build</i> causes the built, ready-to-install module code
    to be available below ./blib/lib and ./blib/arch and that there's a
    directory called 't' that contains our tests. Test::Harness isn't hardwired
    to that configuration but it saves me from explaining which files live where
    for each example.</p>
<p class="Pp">Back to <i>prove</i>; like <i>make test</i> it runs a test suite -
    but it provides far more control over which tests are executed, in what
    order and how their results are reported. Typically <i>make test</i> runs
    all the test scripts below the 't' directory. To do the same thing with
    prove I type:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  prove -rb t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The switches here are -r to recurse into any directories below 't'
    and -b which adds ./blib/lib and ./blib/arch to Perl's include path so that
    the tests can find the code they will be testing. If I'm testing a module of
    which an earlier version is already installed I need to be careful about the
    include path to make sure I'm not running my tests against the installed
    version rather than the new one that I'm working on.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike <i>make test</i>, typing <i>prove</i> doesn't automatically
    rebuild my module. If I forget to make before prove I will be testing
    against older versions of those files - which inevitably leads to confusion.
    I either get into the habit of typing</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  make &amp;&amp; prove -rb t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or - if I have no XS code that needs to be built I use the modules
    below <i>lib</i> instead</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  prove -Ilib -r t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">So far I've shown you nothing that <i>make test</i> doesn't do.
    Let's fix that.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Saved_State"><a class="permalink" href="#Saved_State">Saved
  State</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If I have failing tests in a test suite that consists of more than
    a handful of scripts and takes more than a few seconds to run it rapidly
    becomes tedious to run the whole test suite repeatedly as I track down the
    problems.</p>
<p class="Pp">I can tell prove just to run the tests that are failing like
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  prove -b t/this_fails.t t/so_does_this.t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That speeds things up but I have to make a note of which tests are
    failing and make sure that I run those tests. Instead I can use prove's
    --state switch and have it keep track of failing tests for me. First I do a
    complete run of the test suite and tell prove to save the results:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  prove -rb --state=save t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That stores a machine readable summary of the test run in a file
    called '.prove' in the current directory. If I have failures I can then run
    just the failing scripts like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  prove -b --state=failed
</pre>
<p class="Pp">I can also tell prove to save the results again so that it updates
    its idea of which tests failed:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  prove -b --state=failed,save
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As soon as one of my failing tests passes it will be removed from
    the list of failed tests. Eventually I fix them all and prove can find no
    failing tests to run:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  Files=0, Tests=0, 0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr + 0.00 sys = 0.00 CPU)
  Result: NOTESTS
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As I work on a particular part of my module it's most likely that
    the tests that cover that code will fail. I'd like to run the whole test
    suite but have it prioritize these 'hot' tests. I can tell prove to do
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  prove -rb --state=hot,save t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">All the tests will run but those that failed most recently will be
    run first. If no tests have failed since I started saving state all tests
    will run in their normal order. This combines full test coverage with early
    notification of failures.</p>
<p class="Pp">The --state switch supports a number of options; for example to
    run failed tests first followed by all remaining tests ordered by the
    timestamps of the test scripts - and save the results - I can use</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  prove -rb --state=failed,new,save t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">See the prove documentation (type prove --man) for the full list
    of state options.</p>
<p class="Pp">When I tell prove to save state it writes a file called '.prove'
    ('_prove' on Windows) in the current directory. It's a YAML document so it's
    quite easy to write tools of your own that work on the saved test state -
    but the format isn't officially documented so it might change without (much)
    warning in the future.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Parallel_Testing"><a class="permalink" href="#Parallel_Testing">Parallel
  Testing</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If my tests take too long to run I may be able to speed them up by
    running multiple test scripts in parallel. This is particularly effective if
    the tests are I/O bound or if I have multiple CPU cores. I tell prove to run
    my tests in parallel like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  prove -rb -j 9 t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The -j switch enables parallel testing; the number that follows it
    is the maximum number of tests to run in parallel. Sometimes tests that pass
    when run sequentially will fail when run in parallel. For example if two
    different test scripts use the same temporary file or attempt to listen on
    the same socket I'll have problems running them in parallel. If I see
    unexpected failures I need to check my tests to work out which of them are
    trampling on the same resource and rename temporary files or add locks as
    appropriate.</p>
<p class="Pp">To get the most performance benefit I want to have the test
    scripts that take the longest to run start first - otherwise I'll be waiting
    for the one test that takes nearly a minute to complete after all the others
    are done. I can use the --state switch to run the tests in slowest to
    fastest order:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  prove -rb -j 9 --state=slow,save t
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Non-Perl_Tests"><a class="permalink" href="#Non-Perl_Tests">Non-Perl
  Tests</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Test Anything Protocol (http://testanything.org/) isn't just
    for Perl. Just about any language can be used to write tests that output
    TAP. There are TAP based testing libraries for C, C++, PHP, Python and many
    others. If I can't find a TAP library for my language of choice it's easy to
    generate valid TAP. It looks like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  1..3 
  ok 1 - init OK 
  ok 2 - opened file 
  not ok 3 - appended to file
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first line is the plan - it specifies the number of tests I'm
    going to run so that it's easy to check that the test script didn't exit
    before running all the expected tests. The following lines are the test
    results - 'ok' for pass, 'not ok' for fail. Each test has a number and,
    optionally, a description. And that's it. Any language that can produce
    output like that on STDOUT can be used to write tests.</p>
<p class="Pp">Recently I've been rekindling a two-decades-old interest in Forth.
    Evidently I have a masochistic streak that even Perl can't satisfy. I want
    to write tests in Forth and run them using prove (you can find my gforth TAP
    experiments at https://svn.hexten.net/andy/Forth/Testing/). I can use the
    --exec switch to tell prove to run the tests using gforth like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  prove -r --exec gforth t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Alternately, if the language used to write my tests allows a
    shebang line I can use that to specify the interpreter. Here's a test
    written in PHP:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  #!/usr/bin/php 
  &lt;?php
    print &quot;1..2\n&quot;; 
    print &quot;ok 1\n&quot;; 
    print &quot;not ok 2\n&quot;;
  ?&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If I save that as t/phptest.t the shebang line will ensure that it
    runs correctly along with all my other tests.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Mixing_it_up"><a class="permalink" href="#Mixing_it_up">Mixing
  it up</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Subtle interdependencies between test programs can mask problems -
    for example an earlier test may neglect to remove a temporary file that
    affects the behaviour of a later test. To find this kind of problem I use
    the --shuffle and --reverse options to run my tests in random or reversed
    order.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Rolling_My_Own"><a class="permalink" href="#Rolling_My_Own">Rolling
  My Own</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If I need a feature that prove doesn't provide I can easily write
    my own.</p>
<p class="Pp">Typically you'll want to change how TAP gets <i>input</i> into and
    <i>output</i> from the parser. App::Prove supports arbitrary plugins, and
    TAP::Harness supports custom <i>formatters</i> and <i>source handlers</i>
    that you can load using either prove or Module::Build; there are many
    examples to base mine on. For more details see App::Prove,
    TAP::Parser::SourceHandler, and TAP::Formatter::Base.</p>
<p class="Pp">If writing a plugin is not enough, you can write your own test
    harness; one of the motives for the 3.00 rewrite of Test::Harness was to
    make it easier to subclass and extend.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Test::Harness module is a compatibility wrapper around
    TAP::Harness. For new applications I should use TAP::Harness directly. As
    we'll see, prove uses TAP::Harness.</p>
<p class="Pp">When I run prove it processes its arguments, figures out which
    test scripts to run and then passes control to TAP::Harness to run the
    tests, parse, analyse and present the results. By subclassing TAP::Harness I
    can customise many aspects of the test run.</p>
<p class="Pp">I want to log my test results in a database so I can track them
    over time. To do this I override the summary method in TAP::Harness. I start
    with a simple prototype that dumps the results as a YAML document:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  package My::TAP::Harness;
  use base 'TAP::Harness';
  use YAML;
  sub summary {
    my ( $self, $aggregate ) = @_; 
    print Dump( $aggregate );
    $self-&gt;SUPER::summary( $aggregate );
  }
  1;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">I need to tell prove to use my My::TAP::Harness. If
    My::TAP::Harness is on Perl's <span class="Li">@INC</span> include path I
    can</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  prove --harness=My::TAP::Harness -rb t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If I don't have My::TAP::Harness installed on
    <span class="Li">@INC</span> I need to provide the correct path to perl when
    I run prove:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  perl -Ilib `which prove` --harness=My::TAP::Harness -rb t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">I can incorporate these options into my own version of prove. It's
    pretty simple. Most of the work of prove is handled by App::Prove. The
    important code in prove is just:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use App::Prove;
  my $app = App::Prove-&gt;new; 
  $app-&gt;process_args(@ARGV); 
  exit( $app-&gt;run ? 0 : 1 );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If I write a subclass of App::Prove I can customise any aspect of
    the test runner while inheriting all of prove's behaviour. Here's
  myprove:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  #!/usr/bin/env perl use lib qw( lib );      # Add ./lib to @INC
  use App::Prove;
  my $app = App::Prove-&gt;new;
  # Use custom TAP::Harness subclass
  $app-&gt;harness( 'My::TAP::Harness' );
  $app-&gt;process_args( @ARGV ); exit( $app-&gt;run ? 0 : 1 );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now I can run my tests like this</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  ./myprove -rb t
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Deeper_Customisation"><a class="permalink" href="#Deeper_Customisation">Deeper
  Customisation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Now that I know how to subclass and replace TAP::Harness I can
    replace any other part of the harness. To do that I need to know which
    classes are responsible for which functionality. Here's a brief guided tour;
    the default class for each component is shown in parentheses. Normally any
    replacements I write will be subclasses of these default classes.</p>
<p class="Pp">When I run my tests TAP::Harness creates a scheduler
    (TAP::Parser::Scheduler) to work out the running order for the tests, an
    aggregator (TAP::Parser::Aggregator) to collect and analyse the test results
    and a formatter (TAP::Formatter::Console) to display those results.</p>
<p class="Pp">If I'm running my tests in parallel there may also be a
    multiplexer (TAP::Parser::Multiplexer) - the component that allows multiple
    tests to run simultaneously.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once it has created those helpers TAP::Harness starts running the
    tests. For each test it creates a new parser (TAP::Parser) which is
    responsible for running the test script and parsing its output.</p>
<p class="Pp">To replace any of these components I call one of these harness
    methods with the name of the replacement class:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  aggregator_class 
  formatter_class 
  multiplexer_class 
  parser_class
  scheduler_class
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For example, to replace the aggregator I would</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $harness-&gt;aggregator_class( 'My::Aggregator' );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Alternately I can supply the names of my substitute classes to the
    TAP::Harness constructor:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my $harness = TAP::Harness-&gt;new(
    { aggregator_class =&gt; 'My::Aggregator' }
  );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If I need to reach even deeper into the internals of the harness I
    can replace the classes that TAP::Parser uses to execute test scripts and
    tokenise their output. Before running a test script TAP::Parser creates a
    grammar (TAP::Parser::Grammar) to decode the raw TAP into tokens, a result
    factory (TAP::Parser::ResultFactory) to turn the decoded TAP results into
    objects and, depending on whether it's running a test script or reading TAP
    from a file, scalar or array a source or an iterator
    (TAP::Parser::IteratorFactory).</p>
<p class="Pp">Each of these objects may be replaced by calling one of these
    parser methods:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  source_class
  perl_source_class 
  grammar_class 
  iterator_factory_class
  result_factory_class
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Callbacks"><a class="permalink" href="#Callbacks">Callbacks</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As an alternative to subclassing the components I need to change I
    can attach callbacks to the default classes. TAP::Harness exposes these
    callbacks:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  parser_args      Tweak the parameters used to create the parser 
  made_parser      Just made a new parser 
  before_runtests  About to run tests 
  after_runtests   Have run all tests 
  after_test       Have run an individual test script
</pre>
<p class="Pp">TAP::Parser also supports callbacks; bailout, comment, plan, test,
    unknown, version and yaml are called for the corresponding TAP result types,
    ALL is called for all results, ELSE is called for all results for which a
    named callback is not installed and EOF is called once at the end of each
    TAP stream.</p>
<p class="Pp">To install a callback I pass the name of the callback and a
    subroutine reference to TAP::Harness or TAP::Parser's callback method:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $harness-&gt;callback( after_test =&gt; sub {
    my ( $script, $desc, $parser ) = @_;
  } );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">I can also pass callbacks to the constructor:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my $harness = TAP::Harness-&gt;new({
    callbacks =&gt; {
            after_test =&gt; sub {
        my ( $script, $desc, $parser ) = @_; 
        # Do something interesting here
            }
    }
  });
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When it comes to altering the behaviour of the test harness
    there's more than one way to do it. Which way is best depends on my
    requirements. In general if I only want to observe test execution without
    changing the harness' behaviour (for example to log test results to a
    database) I choose callbacks. If I want to make the harness behave
    differently subclassing gives me more control.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Parsing_"><a class="permalink" href="#Parsing_">Parsing
  TAP</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perhaps I don't need a complete test harness. If I already have a
    TAP test log that I need to parse all I need is TAP::Parser and the various
    classes it depends upon. Here's the code I need to run a test and parse its
    TAP output</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use TAP::Parser;
  my $parser = TAP::Parser-&gt;new( { source =&gt; 't/simple.t' } );
  while ( my $result = $parser-&gt;next ) {
    print $result-&gt;as_string, &quot;\n&quot;;
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Alternately I can pass an open filehandle as source and have the
    parser read from that rather than attempting to run a test script:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  open my $tap, '&lt;', 'tests.tap' 
    or die &quot;Can't read TAP transcript ($!)\n&quot;; 
  my $parser = TAP::Parser-&gt;new( { source =&gt; $tap } );
  while ( my $result = $parser-&gt;next ) {
    print $result-&gt;as_string, &quot;\n&quot;;
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This approach is useful if I need to convert my TAP based test
    results into some other representation. See TAP::Convert::TET
    (http://search.cpan.org/dist/TAP-Convert-TET/) for an example of this
    approach.</p>
