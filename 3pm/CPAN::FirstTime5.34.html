      directories that are built up before running <span class="Li">&quot;make

      modules that are indexed with a distro with a higher distro-version number
      than the current one. It can then let the build of this distro fail when
      it would not represent the most up-to-date version of the distro.
    <p class="Pp">Note: choosing anything but 'yes' for this option will need
        CPAN::DistnameInfo being installed for taking effect.</p>

  <dd>Normally CPAN.pm keeps config variables in memory and changes need to be
      saved in a separate 'o conf commit' command to make them permanent between

  <dd>Until version 1.88 CPAN.pm never trusted the contents of the build_dir
      directory between sessions. Since 1.88_58 CPAN.pm has a YAML-based
      mechanism that makes it possible to share the contents of the build_dir/
      directory between different sessions with the same version of perl. People
      who prefer to test things several days before installing will like this
      feature because it saves a lot of time.
    <p class="Pp">If you say yes to the following question, CPAN will try to
        store enough information about the build process so that it can pick up

  <dd>When a module declares another one as a 'build_requires' prerequisite this
      means that the other module is only needed for building or testing the
      module but need not be installed permanently. In this case you may wish to
      install that other module nonetheless or just keep it in the 'build_dir'
      directory to have it available only temporarily. Installing saves time on
      future installations but makes the perl installation bigger.
    <p class="Pp">You can choose if you want to always install (yes), never
        install (no) or be always asked. In the latter case you can set the
        default answer for the question to yes (ask/yes) or no (ask/no).</p>

  <dt id="check_sigs"><a class="permalink" href="#check_sigs">check_sigs</a></dt>
  <dd>CPAN packages can be digitally signed by authors and thus verified with
      the security provided by strong cryptography. The exact mechanism is
      defined in the Module::Signature module. While this is generally
      considered a good thing, it is not always convenient to the end user to
      install modules that are signed incorrectly or where the key of the author
      is not available or where some prerequisite for Module::Signature has a
      bug and so on.
    <p class="Pp">With the check_sigs parameter you can turn signature checking
        on and off. The default is off for now because the whole tool chain for
        the functionality is not yet considered mature by some. The author of
        CPAN.pm would recommend setting it to true most of the time and turning
        it off only if it turns out to be annoying.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that if you do not have Module::Signature installed, no
        signature checks will be performed at all.</p>

      built in default sites for downloading. It will ask you once per session
      if a connection to the internet is OK and only if you say yes, it will try
      to connect. But to avoid this question, you can choose your favorite
      download sites once and get away with it. Or, if you have no favorite

  <dd>Sometimes you may wish to leave the processes run by CPAN alone without
      caring about them. Because the Makefile.PL or the Build.PL sometimes
      contains question you're expected to answer, you can set a timer that will
      kill a 'perl Makefile.PL' process after the specified time in seconds.
    <p class="Pp">If you set this value to 0, these processes will wait forever.

  <dt id="index_expire"><a class="permalink" href="#index_expire">index_expire</a></dt>
  <dd>The CPAN indexes are usually rebuilt once or twice per hour, but the
      typical CPAN mirror mirrors only once or twice per day. Depending on the
      quality of your mirror and your desire to be on the bleeding edge, you may
      want to set the following value to more or less than one day (which is the
      default). It determines after how many days CPAN.pm downloads new indexes.
    <p class="Pp">Let the index expire after how many days?</p>

  <dt id="suggests_policy"><a class="permalink" href="#suggests_policy">suggests_policy</a></dt>
  <dd>(Experimental feature!) Some CPAN modules suggest additional, optional
      dependencies. These 'suggest' dependencies provide enhanced operation.
      When this policy is true, suggested modules will be included with required
      modules.
    <p class="Pp">Include suggested modules?</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="tar_verbosity"><a class="permalink" href="#tar_verbosity">tar_verbosity</a></dt>
  <dd>When CPAN.pm uses the tar command, which switch for the verbosity shall be
      used? Choose 'none' for quiet operation, 'v' for file name listing, 'vv'
      for full listing.
    <p class="Pp">Tar command verbosity level (none or v or vv)?</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="term_is_latin"><a class="permalink" href="#term_is_latin">term_is_latin</a></dt>
  <dd>The next option deals with the charset (a.k.a. character set) your
      terminal supports. In general, CPAN is English speaking territory, so the
      charset does not matter much but some CPAN have names that are outside the
      ASCII range. If your terminal supports UTF-8, you should say no to the
      next question. If it expects ISO-8859-1 (also known as LATIN1) then you
      should say yes. If it supports neither, your answer does not matter
      because you will not be able to read the names of some authors anyway. If
      you answer no, names will be output in UTF-8.
    <p class="Pp">Your terminal expects ISO-8859-1 (yes/no)?</p>

  <dt id="term_ornaments"><a class="permalink" href="#term_ornaments">term_ornaments</a></dt>
  <dd>When using Term::ReadLine, you can turn ornaments on so that your input
      stands out against the output from CPAN.pm.
    <p class="Pp">Do you want to turn ornaments on?</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="test_report"><a class="permalink" href="#test_report">test_report</a></dt>
  <dd>The goal of the CPAN Testers project (http://testers.cpan.org/) is to test
      as many CPAN packages as possible on as many platforms as possible. This
      provides valuable feedback to module authors and potential users to
      identify bugs or platform compatibility issues and improves the overall
      quality and value of CPAN.
    <p class="Pp">One way you can contribute is to send test results for each
        module that you install. If you install the CPAN::Reporter module, you
        have the option to automatically generate and deliver test reports to
        CPAN Testers whenever you run tests on a CPAN package.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See the CPAN::Reporter documentation for additional details
        and configuration settings. If your firewall blocks outgoing traffic,
        you may need to configure CPAN::Reporter before sending reports.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Generate test reports if CPAN::Reporter is installed
      (yes/no)?</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="perl5lib_verbosity"><a class="permalink" href="#perl5lib_verbosity">perl5lib_verbosity</a></dt>
  <dd>When CPAN.pm extends <span class="Li">@INC</span> via PERL5LIB, it prints
      a list of directories added (or a summary of how many directories are
      added). Choose 'v' to get this message, 'none' to suppress it.
    <p class="Pp">Verbosity level for PERL5LIB changes (none or v)?</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="prefer_external_tar"><a class="permalink" href="#prefer_external_tar">prefer_external_tar</a></dt>
  <dd>Per default all untar operations are done with the perl module
      Archive::Tar; by setting this variable to true the external tar command is
      used if available; on Unix this is usually preferred because they have a
      reliable and fast gnutar implementation.
    <p class="Pp">Use the external tar program instead of Archive::Tar?</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="trust_test_report_history"><a class="permalink" href="#trust_test_report_history">trust_test_report_history</a></dt>
  <dd>When a distribution has already been tested by CPAN::Reporter on this
      machine, CPAN can skip the test phase and just rely on the test report
      history instead.
    <p class="Pp">Note that this will not apply to distributions that failed
        tests because of missing dependencies. Also, tests can be run regardless
        of the history using &quot;force&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Do you want to rely on the test report history (yes/no)?</p>

  <dt id="urllist_ping_external"><a class="permalink" href="#urllist_ping_external">urllist_ping_external</a></dt>
  <dd>When automatic selection of the nearest cpan mirrors is performed, turn on
      the use of the external ping via Net::Ping::External. This is recommended
      in the case the local network has a transparent proxy.
    <p class="Pp">Do you want to use the external ping command when
        autoselecting mirrors?</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="urllist_ping_verbose"><a class="permalink" href="#urllist_ping_verbose">urllist_ping_verbose</a></dt>
  <dd>When automatic selection of the nearest cpan mirrors is performed, this
      option can be used to turn on verbosity during the selection process.
    <p class="Pp">Do you want to see verbosity turned on when autoselecting
        mirrors?</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="use_prompt_default"><a class="permalink" href="#use_prompt_default">use_prompt_default</a></dt>
  <dd>When this is true, CPAN will set PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT to a true value. This
      causes ExtUtils::MakeMaker (and compatible) prompts to use default values
      instead of stopping to prompt you to answer questions. It also sets
      NONINTERACTIVE_TESTING to a true value to signal more generally that
      distributions should not try to interact with you.
    <p class="Pp">Do you want to use prompt defaults (yes/no)?</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="use_sqlite"><a class="permalink" href="#use_sqlite">use_sqlite</a></dt>
  <dd>CPAN::SQLite is a layer between the index files that are downloaded from
      the CPAN and CPAN.pm that speeds up metadata queries and reduces memory
      consumption of CPAN.pm considerably.
    <p class="Pp">Use CPAN::SQLite if available? (yes/no)?</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="version_timeout"><a class="permalink" href="#version_timeout">version_timeout</a></dt>
  <dd>This timeout prevents CPAN from hanging when trying to parse a
      pathologically coded <span class="Li">$VERSION</span> from a module.
    <p class="Pp">The default is 15 seconds. If you set this value to 0, no
        timeout will occur, but this is not recommended.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Timeout for parsing module versions?</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="yaml_load_code"><a class="permalink" href="#yaml_load_code">yaml_load_code</a></dt>
  <dd>Both YAML.pm and YAML::Syck are capable of deserialising code. As this
      requires a string eval, which might be a security risk, you can use this
      option to enable or disable the deserialisation of code via
      CPAN::DeferredCode. (Note: This does not work under perl 5.6)
    <p class="Pp">Do you want to enable code deserialisation (yes/no)?</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="yaml_module"><a class="permalink" href="#yaml_module">yaml_module</a></dt>
  <dd>At the time of this writing (2009-03) there are three YAML implementations
      working: YAML, YAML::Syck, and YAML::XS. The latter two are faster but
      need a C compiler installed on your system. There may be more alternative
      YAML conforming modules. When I tried two other players, YAML::Tiny and
      YAML::Perl, they seemed not powerful enough to work with CPAN.pm. This may
      have changed in the meantime.
    <p class="Pp">Which YAML implementation would you prefer?</p>
