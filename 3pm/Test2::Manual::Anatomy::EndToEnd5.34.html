<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$!, $@, $? and $^E are captured and preserved.</dt>
  <dd>Test2 makes a point to preserve the values of $!, $@, $? and $^E such that
      the test tools do not modify these variables unexpectedly. They are
      captured first thing so that they can be restored later.</dd>
  <dt id="The~4"><a class="permalink" href="#The~4">The API state is changed to
    'loaded'.</a></dt>
  <dd>The 'loaded' state means that test tools have already started running.
      This is important as some plugins need to take effect before any tests are
      run. This state change only happens the first time a context is acquired,
      and may trigger some hooks defined by plugins to run.</dd>
  <dt id="The~5"><a class="permalink" href="#The~5">The current hub is
    found.</a></dt>
  <dd>A context attaches itself to the current Test2::Hub. If there is no
      current hub then the root hub will be initialized. This will also
      initialize the hub stack if necessary.</dd>
  <dt id="Context"><a class="permalink" href="#Context">Context acquire hooks
    fire.</a></dt>
  <dd>It is possible to create global, or hub-specific hooks that fire whenever
      a context is acquired, these hooks will fire now. These hooks fire even if
      there is an existing context.</dd>
  <dt id="Any"><a class="permalink" href="#Any">Any existing context is
    found.</a></dt>
  <dd>If the current hub already has a context then a clone of it will be used
      instead of a completely new context. This is important because it allows
      nested tools to inherit the context used by parent tools.</dd>
  <dt id="Stack"><a class="permalink" href="#Stack">Stack depth is
    measured.</a></dt>
  <dd>Test2 makes a point to catch mistakes in how the context is used. The
      stack depth is used to accomplish this. If there is an existing context
      the depth will be checked against the one found here. If the old context
      has the same stack depth, or a shallower one, it means a tool is
      misbehaving and did not clean up the context when it was done, in which
      case the old context will be cleaned up, and a warning issued.</dd>
  <dt id="A~3"><a class="permalink" href="#A~3">A new context is created (if no
    existing context was found)</a></dt>
  <dd>If there is no existing context, a new one will be created using the data

  <dt id="Context~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Context~2">Context init hooks

  <dd>If a new context was created, context-creation hooks will fire.</dd>
  <dt>$!, $@, $?, and $^E are restored.</dt>
  <dd>We make sure $!, $@, $?, and $^E are unchanged at this point so that
      changes we made will not effect anything else. This is done in case
      something inside the context construction accidentally changed these
    vars.</dd>

  <dd>Release hooks are the main motivation behind making the

      required action on the part of test tools. These are hooks that we can
      have called when a tool is complete. This is how plugins like
      Test2::Plugin::DieOnFail are implemented. If we simply had a destructor
      call the hooks then we would be unable to write this plugin as a

<p class="Pp">Test2 has some behaviors it runs in an <span class="Li">&quot;END

  <dd>A warning will be produced if Test::Builder is loaded, but has a different
      version compared to Test2::API. This situation can happen if you downgrade
      to an older Test-Simple distribution, and is a bad situation.</dd>
  <dt id="Any~3"><a class="permalink" href="#Any~3">Any remaining context
    objects are cleaned up.</a></dt>
  <dd>If there are leftover context objects they will need to be cleaned up. A
      leftover context is never a good thing, and usually requires a warning. A
      leftover context could also be the result of an exception being thrown
      which terminates the script, Test2 is fairly good at noticing this and not
      warning in these cases as the warning would simply be noise.</dd>
