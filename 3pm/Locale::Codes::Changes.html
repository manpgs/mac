<p class="Pp">This describes the changes made to modules in the Locale-Codes
    distribution. Major changes are marked with asterisks (*). For the most
    part, all modules have remained backward compatible at every release, but
    occasionally a change is made which is backward incompatible. These are
    marked with an exclamation mark (!).</p>
<p class="Pp">As of 3.00, the codes are autogenerated from the standards. With
    each release, codes will be re-generated and tested to see if any code
    changed. Any time there are any changes to the codes, it will be flagged
    below with a change: NEW CODE(s).</p>
<p class="Pp">I intend to check for new codes four times a year (March, June,
    September, December). I will also check on request, so if a code changes
    that you use, feel free to contact me. Any time there are new codes, I will
    add them to the module and release a new version.</p>

  <dt id="FIPS"><a class="permalink" href="#FIPS"><b>FIPS-10 country codes
    deprecated</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The FIPS-10 document is being withdrawn. It was deprecated in 2008, and is
      being updated now only until all the agencies that use it have switched to
      something else. The current version no longer lists the long names for
      countries. These long names (such as 'Republic of Albania' for Albania)
      only appeared in the old FIPS-10 document which is no longer available, so
      they are no longer available in this module.
    <p class="Pp">I will continue to support the FIPS-10 codeset as long as it
        is available, but at that point, it will be withdrawn immediately. If an
        official end-of-life date is announced, I will include a notice here.
        Otherwise, support for the codeset will be discontinued when the
        document is withdrawn.</p>

  <dd>The IANA domain codes have changed slightly. The IANA no longer publishes
      a list of countries associated with their codes. Instead, they use the ISO
      3166 codes and country names. However, they support a few non-standard
      codes, so I will continue to maintain this codeset. The domain codes are
      now lowercase to correspond to the ISO 3166 codes.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="New~2"><a class="permalink" href="#New~2"><b>New
    maintainer</b></a></dt>
  <dd>From 1997 to 2004, Locale::Codes was maintained by Neil Bowers.
      Unfortunately, no updates were made from June 2004 to January 2010. During
      that time, a number of changes have been made to the standards since then,
      so the data included was out-of-date.
    <p class="Pp">I contacted Neil to get his permission to assume maintenance
        of the module, and he kindly agreed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>(*) (!) All codes are generated from standards</b></dt>
  <dd>All of the values returned by the various functions are now values
      directly from the standards. This means that the values returned in the
      2.xx series are not necessarily the same as the values returned here.
    <p class="Pp">As an example, the ISO 3166 standard which lists country codes
        refers to the country associated with the code &quot;bo&quot; as
        &quot;Bolivia, Plurinational State of&quot;, so that is what is
        returned. In the 2.xx series, &quot;Bolivia&quot; was returned. Also,
        the country names vary from one standard to another. So the code
        &quot;bol&quot; which is maintained by the United Nations returns the
        name of the country as &quot;Bolivia (Plurinational State of)&quot;.
        Some common aliases have been added, so you can still request a code
        associated with a county name &quot;Bolivia&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Since the data comes from the standards, some
        &quot;incorrect&quot; values are no longer supported. For example, 2.07
        treated &quot;Zaire&quot; as an alias for &quot;Congo&quot;, but the
        country changed it's name, and &quot;Zaire&quot; is not in the standard,
        so it has been dropped in 3.00.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Added~7"><a class="permalink" href="#Added~7"><b>Added new
    codeset(s)</b></a></dt>
  <dd>FIPS 10 country codes (requested in RT 1755)
    <p class="Pp">Alpha-3 and Term language codes (requested in RT 11730)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Numeric currency codes (requested in RT 18797)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>(*) (!) Locale::Script changed</b></dt>
  <dd>In 2.xx, Locale::Script assigned scripts to country codes, which is NOT
      how it is done currently in the standards. It appears that an older
      version of ISO 15924 did this, but I haven't found an old version to
      confirm that, and in any case, that is not the case in the current
      standards.
    <p class="Pp">As a result, the Locale::Script module is completely
        incompatible with the 2.xx version with respect to the types of codes it
        supports. None of the old codes will work.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Added~8"><a class="permalink" href="#Added~8"><b>Added missing
    functions</b></a></dt>
  <dd>I've added in some functions which were &quot;missing&quot; previously
      (since there was only one set of codes supported, the code2code functions
      didn't apply):
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   language_code2code
   currency_code2code
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">so the interfaces for each type of codes are consistent.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>(!) Dropped support for _alias_code</b></dt>
  <dd>In Locale::Country, _alias_code was an allowed, but deprecated function
      which was documented to be supported in the 2.xx series. I've removed
    it.</dd>
  <dt><b>(!) All functions return the standard value</b></dt>
  <dd>code2country (and other equivalent functions) now returns the name of the
      country specified in the standard (if the different standards refer to the
      country by different variations in the name, the results will differ based
      on the CODESET)</dd>
  <dt><b>(!) rename_country function altered</b></dt>
  <dd>The rename_country function from 2.07 would guess the CODESET (unlike all
      other functions which used a default of LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2). The guess
      can cause problems since (with the addition of FIPS) codes may appear in
      different codesets for different countries. The behavior has been changed
      to be the same as other functions (default to LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2).</dd>

    was a constant, which isn't allowed, unless you put the () with the constant
    to force the right interpretation. Pointed out by TJ Mather and MYT.</p>
<p class="Pp">Updated the URL for the appendix in the CIA world factbook. Patch
    from TJ Mather.</p>

<p class="Pp">Updated according to changes in ISO 3166-1 described in ISO 3166-1
    newsletters V-4 and V-5, dated 2002-05-20:
  <br/>
   - Kazakstan is now &quot;Kazakhstan&quot;
  <br/>
   - Macau is now &quot;Macao&quot; The old names are retained as aliases.</p>
<p class="Pp">The alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes for East Timor have changed:
  <br/>
   tp -&gt; tl
  <br/>
   tmp -&gt; tls the numeric code stays 626. If you want to support the old
    codes, you can use the semi-private function <i>alias_code()</i>.</p>

<p class="Pp">Added semi-private routine <i>rename_country()</i> to
    Locale::Country, based on a patch from Iain Chalmers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Added test rename.t for the above function.</p>
<p class="Pp">Renamed _alias_code to be alias_code. Have retained the old name

  2.00 (2002-02-17; neilb)</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Created Locale::Script which provides an interface to the ISO
    codes for identification of scripts (writing scripts, rather than perl style
    scripts). The codes are defined by ISO 15924, which is currently in final
    draft. Thanks to Jarkko for pointing out this new standard. All three code
    sets are supported, and a test-suite added.</p>
<p class="Pp">Added support for country name variants to Locale::Country, so
    that
  <br/>
   country2code('USA')
  <br/>
   country2code('United States')
  <br/>
   country2code('United States of America') will all return 'us'. This had been
    in the LIMITATIONS section since the first version. Patch from TJ Mather
    with additional variants from me. Added test-cases for these.</p>
<p class="Pp">Added VERSION to Locale::Constants. Thanks to Jarkko for pointing
    that it was missing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Should really have bumped major version with previous release,
    since there was a change to the API.</p>

<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_2
   LOCALE_CODE_ALPHA_3
   LOCALE_CODE_NUMERIC
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Updated Locale::Country to support all three code sets defined by
    ISO 3166. This was requested by Keith Wall. I haven't added multiple codeset
    support to the other modules yet - I'll wait until someone asks for
  them.</p>

<p class="Pp">Updated Locale::Country and Locale::Language to reflect changes in
    the relevant ISO standards. These mainly reflect languages which are new to
    the relevant standard, and changes in the spelling of some country
