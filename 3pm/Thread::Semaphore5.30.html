<p class="Pp">Semaphores provide a mechanism to regulate access to resources.
    Unlike locks, semaphores aren't tied to particular scalars, and so may be
    used to control access to anything you care to use them for.</p>
<p class="Pp">Semaphores don't limit their values to zero and one, so they can
    be used to control access to some resource that there may be more than one
    of (e.g., filehandles). Increment and decrement amounts aren't fixed at one
    either, so threads can reserve or return multiple resources at once.</p>

  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;new&quot;</span> creates a new semaphore, and

  <dd></dd>
  <dt>-&gt;down(NUMBER)</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;down&quot;</span> method decreases the
      semaphore's count by the specified number (which must be an integer &gt;=
      1), or by one if no number is specified.
    <p class="Pp">If the semaphore's count would drop below zero, this method
        will block until such time as the semaphore's count is greater than or
        equal to the amount you're <span class="Li">&quot;down&quot;</span>ing
        the semaphore's count by.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is the semaphore &quot;P operation&quot; (the name
        derives from the Dutch word &quot;pak&quot;, which means
        &quot;capture&quot; -- the semaphore operations were named by the late
        Dijkstra, who was Dutch).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-&gt;<b>down_nb()</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>-&gt;down_nb(NUMBER)</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;down_nb&quot;</span> method attempts to
      decrease the semaphore's count by the specified number (which must be an
      integer &gt;= 1), or by one if no number is specified.
    <p class="Pp">If the semaphore's count would drop below zero, this method
        will return <i>false</i>, and the semaphore's count remains unchanged.
        Otherwise, the semaphore's count is decremented and this method returns

  <dt>-&gt;down_force(NUMBER)</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;down_force&quot;</span> method decreases the
      semaphore's count by the specified number (which must be an integer &gt;=
      1), or by one if no number is specified. This method does not block, and
      may cause the semaphore's count to drop below zero.</dd>
  <dt>-&gt;down_timed(TIMEOUT)</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>-&gt;down_timed(TIMEOUT, NUMBER)</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;down_timed&quot;</span> method attempts to
      decrease the semaphore's count by 1 or by the specified number within the
      specified timeout period given in seconds (which must be an integer &gt;=
      0).
    <p class="Pp">If the semaphore's count would drop below zero, this method
        will block until either the semaphore's count is greater than or equal
        to the amount you're <span class="Li">&quot;down&quot;</span>ing the
        semaphore's count by, or until the timeout is reached.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the timeout is reached, this method will return

        the semaphore's count is decremented and this method returns

  <dt>-&gt;<b>up()</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>-&gt;up(NUMBER)</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;up&quot;</span> method increases the
      semaphore's count by the number specified (which must be an integer &gt;=
      1), or by one if no number is specified.
    <p class="Pp">This will unblock any thread that is blocked trying to
        <span class="Li">&quot;down&quot;</span> the semaphore if the
        <span class="Li">&quot;up&quot;</span> raises the semaphore's count
        above the amount that the <span class="Li">&quot;down&quot;</span> is
        trying to decrement it by. For example, if three threads are blocked
        trying to <span class="Li">&quot;down&quot;</span> a semaphore by one,
        and another thread <span class="Li">&quot;up&quot;</span>s the semaphore
        by two, then two of the blocked threads (which two is indeterminate)
        will become unblocked.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is the semaphore &quot;V operation&quot; (the name

<p class="Pp">Semaphores created by Thread::Semaphore can be used in both
    threaded and non-threaded applications. This allows you to write modules and
    packages that potentially make use of semaphores, and that will function in
    either environment.</p>
