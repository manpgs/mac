<p class="Pp">This pragma provides an easy and convenient way to enable or
    disable experimental features.</p>
<p class="Pp">Every version of perl has some number of features present but
    considered &quot;experimental.&quot; For much of the life of Perl 5, this
    was only a designation found in the documentation. Starting in Perl v5.10.0,
    and more aggressively in v5.18.0, experimental features were placed behind
    pragmata used to enable the feature and disable associated warnings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;experimental&quot;</span> pragma exists
    to combine the required incantations into a single interface stable across
    releases of perl. For every experimental feature, this should enable the
    feature and silence warnings for the enclosing lexical scope:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use experimental 'feature-name';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To disable the feature and, if applicable, re-enable any warnings,
    use:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  no experimental 'feature-name';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The supported features, documented further below, are:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;array_base&quot;</span> - allow the use of
      <span class="Li">$[</span> to change the starting index of
      <span class="Li">@array</span>.
    <p class="Pp">This is supported on all versions of perl.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;autoderef&quot;</span> - allow push, each, keys,
      and other built-ins on references.
    <p class="Pp">This was added in perl 5.14.0 and removed in perl 5.23.1.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;bitwise&quot;</span> - allow the new stringwise bit
      operators
    <p class="Pp">This was added in perl 5.22.0.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;const_attr&quot;</span> - allow the :const
      attribute on subs
    <p class="Pp">This was added in perl 5.22.0.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;lexical_topic&quot;</span> - allow the use of
      lexical <span class="Li">$_</span> via <span class="Li">&quot;my
      $_&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">This was added in perl 5.10.0 and removed in perl 5.23.4.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;lexical_subs&quot;</span> - allow the use of
      lexical subroutines.
    <p class="Pp">This was added in 5.18.0.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;postderef&quot;</span> - allow the use of postfix
      dereferencing expressions, including in interpolating strings
    <p class="Pp">This was added in perl 5.20.0.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;re_strict&quot;</span> - enables strict mode in
      regular expressions
    <p class="Pp">This was added in perl 5.22.0.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;refaliasing&quot;</span> - allow aliasing via
      <span class="Li">&quot;\$x = \$y&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">This was added in perl 5.22.0.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;regex_sets&quot;</span> - allow extended bracketed
      character classes in regexps
    <p class="Pp">This was added in perl 5.18.0.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;signatures&quot;</span> - allow subroutine
      signatures (for named arguments)
    <p class="Pp">This was added in perl 5.20.0.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;smartmatch&quot;</span> - allow the use of
      <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">This was added in perl 5.10.0, but it should be noted there
        are significant incompatibilities between 5.10.0 and 5.10.1.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;switch&quot;</span> - allow the use of
      <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span>, given, and when
    <p class="Pp">This was added in perl 5.10.0.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;win32_perlio&quot;</span> - allows the use of the
      :win32 IO layer.
    <p class="Pp">This was added on perl 5.22.0.</p>
  </li>

<p class="Pp">Using this pragma to 'enable an experimental feature' is another
    way of saying that this pragma will disable the warnings which would result
    from using that feature. Therefore, the order in which pragmas are applied
    is important. In particular, you probably want to enable experimental
    features <i>after</i> you enable warnings:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use warnings;
  use experimental 'smartmatch';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You also need to take care with modules that enable warnings for
    you. A common example being Moose. In this example, warnings for the
    'smartmatch' feature are first turned on by the warnings pragma, off by the
    experimental pragma and back on again by the Moose module (fix is to switch
    the last two lines):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use warnings;
  use experimental 'smartmatch';
  use Moose;
</pre>

<p class="Pp">Because of the nature of the features it enables, forward
    compatibility can not be guaranteed in any way.</p>
