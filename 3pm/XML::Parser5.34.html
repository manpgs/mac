<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This module provides ways to parse XML documents. It is built on
    top of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's
    expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new
    instance of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document.
    Expat options may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These
    options are then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can
    also be given as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they
    override options given at XML::Parser creation time.</p>
<p class="Pp">The behavior of the parser is controlled either by
    <span class="Li">&quot;STYLES&quot;</span> and/or
    <span class="Li">&quot;HANDLERS&quot;</span> options, or by
    &quot;setHandlers&quot; method. These all provide mechanisms for XML::Parser
    to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If neither
    <span class="Li">&quot;Style&quot;</span> nor
    <span class="Li">&quot;Handlers&quot;</span> are specified, then parsing
    just checks the document for being well-formed.</p>
<p class="Pp">When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first
    parameter the <i>Expat</i> object, not the Parser object.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="new"><a class="permalink" href="#new">new</a></dt>
  <dd>This is a class method, the constructor for XML::Parser. Options are
      passed as keyword value pairs. Recognized options are:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Style
    <p class="Pp">This option provides an easy way to create a given style of
        parser. The built in styles are: &quot;Debug&quot;, &quot;Subs&quot;,
        &quot;Tree&quot;, &quot;Objects&quot;, and &quot;Stream&quot;. These are
        all defined in separate packages under
        <span class="Li">&quot;XML::Parser::Style::*&quot;</span>, and you can
        find further documentation for each style both below, and in those
        packages.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Custom styles can be provided by giving a full package name
        containing at least one '::'. This package should then have subs defined
        for each handler it wishes to have installed. See &quot;STYLES&quot;
        below for a discussion of each built in style.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Handlers
    <p class="Pp">When provided, this option should be an anonymous hash
        containing as keys the type of handler and as values a sub reference to
        handle that type of event. All the handlers get passed as their 1st
        parameter the instance of expat that is parsing the document. Further
        details on handlers can be found in &quot;HANDLERS&quot;. Any handler
        set here overrides the corresponding handler set with the Style
      option.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Pkg
    <p class="Pp">Some styles will refer to subs defined in this package. If not
        provided, it defaults to the package which called the constructor.</p>
  </li>
  <li>ErrorContext
    <p class="Pp">This is an Expat option. When this option is defined, errors
        are reported in context. The value should be the number of lines to show
        on either side of the line in which the error occurred.</p>
  </li>
  <li>ProtocolEncoding
    <p class="Pp">This is an Expat option. This sets the protocol encoding name.
        It defaults to none. The built-in encodings are:
        <span class="Li">&quot;UTF-8&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;UTF-16&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;US-ASCII&quot;</span>. Other encodings may be
        used if they have encoding maps in one of the directories in the
        <span class="Li">@Encoding_Path</span> list. Check &quot;ENCODINGS&quot;
        for more information on encoding maps. Setting the protocol encoding
        overrides any encoding in the XML declaration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Namespaces
    <p class="Pp">This is an Expat option. If this is set to a true value, then
        namespace processing is done during the parse. See
        &quot;Namespaces&quot; in XML::Parser::Expat for further discussion of
        namespace processing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>NoExpand
    <p class="Pp">This is an Expat option. Normally, the parser will try to
        expand references to entities defined in the internal subset. If this
        option is set to a true value, and a default handler is also set, then
        the default handler will be called when an entity reference is seen in
        text. This has no effect if a default handler has not been registered,
        and it has no effect on the expansion of entity references inside
        attribute values.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Stream_Delimiter
    <p class="Pp">This is an Expat option. It takes a string value. When this
        string is found alone on a line while parsing from a stream, then the
        parse is ended as if it saw an end of file. The intended use is with a
        stream of xml documents in a MIME multipart format. The string should
        not contain a trailing newline.</p>
  </li>
  <li>ParseParamEnt
    <p class="Pp">This is an Expat option. Unless standalone is set to
        &quot;yes&quot; in the XML declaration, setting this to a true value
        allows the external DTD to be read, and parameter entities to be parsed
        and expanded.</p>
  </li>
  <li>NoLWP
    <p class="Pp">This option has no effect if the ExternEnt or ExternEntFin
        handlers are directly set. Otherwise, if true, it forces the use of a
        file based external entity handler.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Non_Expat_Options
    <p class="Pp">If provided, this should be an anonymous hash whose keys are
        options that shouldn't be passed to Expat. This should only be of
        concern to those subclassing XML::Parser.</p>
  </li>

  <dt id="setHandlers("><a class="permalink" href="#setHandlers(">setHandlers(TYPE,
    HANDLER [, TYPE, HANDLER [...]])</a></dt>
  <dd>This method registers handlers for various parser events. It overrides any
      previous handlers registered through the Style or Handler options or
      through earlier calls to setHandlers. By providing a false or undefined
      value as the handler, the existing handler can be unset.
    <p class="Pp">This method returns a list of type, handler pairs
        corresponding to the input. The handlers returned are the ones that were
        in effect prior to the call.</p>

  </dd>
  <dt id="parse("><a class="permalink" href="#parse(">parse(SOURCE [, OPT =&gt;
    OPT_VALUE [...]])</a></dt>
  <dd>The SOURCE parameter should either be a string containing the whole XML
      document, or it should be an open IO::Handle. Constructor options to
      XML::Parser::Expat given as keyword-value pairs may follow the SOURCE
      parameter. These override, for this call, any options or attributes passed
      through from the XML::Parser instance.
    <p class="Pp">A die call is thrown if a parse error occurs. Otherwise it
        will return 1 or whatever is returned from the <b>Final</b> handler, if
        one is installed. In other words, what parse may return depends on the
        style.</p>

    OPT =&gt; OPT_VALUE [...]])</a></dt>
  <dd>Open FILE for reading, then call parse with the open handle. The file is
      closed no matter how parse returns. Returns what parse returns.</dd>
  <dt id="parse_start(_"><a class="permalink" href="#parse_start(_">parse_start([
    OPT =&gt; OPT_VALUE [...]])</a></dt>
  <dd>Create and return a new instance of XML::Parser::ExpatNB. Constructor
      options may be provided. If an init handler has been provided, it is
      called before returning the ExpatNB object. Documents are parsed by making
      incremental calls to the parse_more method of this object, which takes a
      string. A single call to the parse_done method of this object, which takes
      no arguments, indicates that the document is finished.
    <p class="Pp">If there is a final handler installed, it is executed by the
        parse_done method before returning and the parse_done method returns
        whatever is returned by the final handler.</p>

<p class="Pp">Expat is an event based parser. As the parser recognizes parts of
    the document (say the start or end tag for an XML element), then any
    handlers registered for that type of an event are called with suitable
    parameters. All handlers receive an instance of XML::Parser::Expat as their
    first argument. See &quot;METHODS&quot; in XML::Parser::Expat for a

<p class="Pp">This is called for a declaration of notation. Notation is the

    base to be used for resolving a relative URI. Sysid is the system id. Pubid
    is the public id. Base, and Pubid may be undefined.</p>
<p class="Pp">This handler should either return a string, which represents the
    contents of the external entity, or return an open filehandle that can be
    read to obtain the contents of the external entity, or return undef, which
    indicates the external entity couldn't be found and will generate a parse
    error.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an open filehandle is returned, it must be returned as either a
    glob (*FOO) or as a reference to a glob (e.g. an instance of
  IO::Handle).</p>
<p class="Pp">A default handler is installed for this event. The default handler
    is XML::Parser::lwp_ext_ent_handler unless the NoLWP option was provided
    with a true value, otherwise XML::Parser::file_ext_ent_handler is the
    default handler for external entities. Even without the NoLWP option, if the
    URI or LWP modules are missing, the file based handler ends up being used
    after giving a warning on the first external entity reference.</p>
<p class="Pp">The LWP external entity handler will use proxies defined in the
    environment (http_proxy, ftp_proxy, etc.).</p>
<p class="Pp">Please note that the LWP external entity handler reads the entire
    entity into a string and returns it, where as the file handler opens a
    filehandle.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also note that the file external entity handler will likely choke
    on absolute URIs or file names that don't fit the conventions of the local
    operating system.</p>
<p class="Pp">The expat base method can be used to set a basename for relative
    pathnames. If no basename is given, or if the basename is itself a relative
    name, then it is relative to the current working directory.</p>

    the element with which the attribute is being associated. The Attname
    parameter is the name of the attribute. Type is the attribute type, given as
    a string. Default is the default value, which will either be
    &quot;#REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;#IMPLIED&quot; or a quoted string (i.e. the

    type, which will be undefined if no public id was given. Internal is the
    internal subset, given as a string. If there was no internal subset, it will
    be undefined. Internal will contain all whitespace, comments, processing
    instructions, and declarations seen in the internal subset. The declarations
    will be there whether or not they have been processed by another handler

    &quot;head&quot; element, a &quot;bar&quot; element and the text
    &quot;do&quot;. After the empty attribute hash, these are represented in
    it's contents by 3 tag-content pairs.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Objects"><a class="permalink" href="#Objects">Objects</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This is similar to the Tree style, except that a hash object is
    created for each element. The corresponding object will be in the class
    whose name is created by appending &quot;::&quot; and the element name to
    the package set with the Pkg option. Non-markup text will be in the
    ::Characters class. The contents of the corresponding object will be in an
    anonymous array that is the value of the Kids property for that object.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Stream"><a class="permalink" href="#Stream">Stream</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This style also uses the Pkg package. If none of the subs that
    this style looks for is there, then the effect of parsing with this style is
    to print a canonical copy of the document without comments or declarations.
    All the subs receive as their 1st parameter the Expat instance for the
    document they're parsing.</p>
<p class="Pp">It looks for the following routines:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>StartDocument
    <p class="Pp">Called at the start of the parse .</p>
  </li>
  <li>StartTag
    <p class="Pp">Called for every start tag with a second parameter of the
        element type. The <span class="Li">$_</span> variable will contain a
        copy of the tag and the <span class="Li">%_</span> variable will contain
        attribute values supplied for that element.</p>
  </li>
  <li>EndTag
    <p class="Pp">Called for every end tag with a second parameter of the
        element type. The <span class="Li">$_</span> variable will contain a
        copy of the end tag.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Text
    <p class="Pp">Called just before start or end tags with accumulated
        non-markup text in the <span class="Li">$_</span> variable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>PI
    <p class="Pp">Called for processing instructions. The
        <span class="Li">$_</span> variable will contain a copy of the PI and
        the target and data are sent as 2nd and 3rd parameters respectively.</p>
  </li>
  <li>EndDocument
    <p class="Pp">Called at conclusion of the parse.</p>
  </li>

<p class="Pp">XML documents may be encoded in character sets other than Unicode
    as long as they may be mapped into the Unicode character set. Expat has
    further restrictions on encodings. Read the xmlparse.h header file in the
    expat distribution to see details on these restrictions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Expat has built-in encodings for:
    <span class="Li">&quot;UTF-8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;UTF-16&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;US-ASCII&quot;</span>. Encodings are set either
    through the XML declaration encoding attribute or through the
    ProtocolEncoding option to XML::Parser or XML::Parser::Expat.</p>
<p class="Pp">For encodings other than the built-ins, expat calls the function
    load_encoding in the Expat package with the encoding name. This function
    looks for a file in the path list
    <span class="Li">@XML::Parser::Expat::Encoding_Path</span>, that matches the
    lower-cased name with a '.enc' extension. The first one it finds, it
  loads.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you wish to build your own encoding maps, check out the
    XML::Encoding module from CPAN.</p>
