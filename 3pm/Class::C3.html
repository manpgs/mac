<p class="Pp">This is pragma to change Perl 5's standard method resolution order
    from depth-first left-to-right (a.k.a - pre-order) to the more sophisticated
    C3 method resolution order.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE:</b> YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS MODULE DIRECTLY - The feature
    provided is integrated into perl version &gt;= 5.9.5, and you should use
    MRO::Compat instead, which will use the core implementation in newer perls,
    but fallback to using this implementation on older perls.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is_C3?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is_C3?">What is
  C3?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">C3 is the name of an algorithm which aims to provide a sane method
    resolution order under multiple inheritance. It was first introduced in the
    language Dylan (see links in the &quot;SEE ALSO&quot; section), and then
    later adopted as the preferred MRO (Method Resolution Order) for the
    new-style classes in Python 2.3. Most recently it has been adopted as the
    'canonical' MRO for Perl 6 classes, and the default MRO for Parrot objects
    as well.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="How_does_C3_work."><a class="permalink" href="#How_does_C3_work.">How
  does C3 work.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">C3 works by always preserving local precedence ordering. This
    essentially means that no class will appear before any of its subclasses.
    Take the classic diamond inheritance pattern for instance:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
     &lt;A&gt;
    /   \
  &lt;B&gt;   &lt;C&gt;
    \   /
     &lt;D&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The standard Perl 5 MRO would be (D, B, A, C). The result being
    that <b>A</b> appears before <b>C</b>, even though <b>C</b> is the subclass
    of <b>A</b>. The C3 MRO algorithm however, produces the following MRO (D, B,
    C, A), which does not have this same issue.</p>
<p class="Pp">This example is fairly trivial, for more complex examples and a
    deeper explanation, see the links in the &quot;SEE ALSO&quot; section.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="How_does_this_module_work?"><a class="permalink" href="#How_does_this_module_work?">How
  does this module work?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This module uses a technique similar to Perl 5's method caching.
    When <span class="Li">&quot;Class::C3::initialize&quot;</span> is called,
    this module calculates the MRO of all the classes which called
    <span class="Li">&quot;use Class::C3&quot;</span>. It then gathers
    information from the symbol tables of each of those classes, and builds a
    set of method aliases for the correct dispatch ordering. Once all these
    C3-based method tables are created, it then adds the method aliases into the
    local classes symbol table.</p>
<p class="Pp">The end result is actually classes with pre-cached method
    dispatch. However, this caching does not do well if you start changing your
    <span class="Li">@ISA</span> or messing with class symbol tables, so you
    should consider your classes to be effectively closed. See the CAVEATS
    section for more details.</p>

  LOWERCASE PRAGMA</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This release also includes an optional module <b>c3</b> in the
    <i>opt/</i> folder. I did not include this in the regular install since
    lowercase module names are considered <i>&quot;bad&quot;</i> by some people.
    However I think that code looks much nicer like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  package MyClass;
  use c3;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is more clunky:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  package MyClass;
  use Class::C3;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But hey, it's your choice, that's why it is optional.</p>

  <dd>This <b>must be called</b> to initialize the C3 method dispatch tables,
      this module <b>will not work</b> if you do not do this. It is advised to
      do this as soon as possible <b>after</b> loading any classes which use C3.
      Here is a quick code example:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  package Foo;
  use Class::C3;
  # ... Foo methods here

  package Bar;
  use Class::C3;
  use base 'Foo';
  # ... Bar methods here

  package main;

  Class::C3::initialize(); # now it is safe to use Foo and Bar
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This function used to be called automatically for you in the
        INIT phase of the perl compiler, but that lead to warnings if this
        module was required at runtime. After discussion with my user base (the
        DBIx::Class folks), we decided that calling this in INIT was more of an
        annoyance than a convenience. I apologize to anyone this causes problems
        for (although I would be very surprised if I had any other users other
        than the DBIx::Class folks). The simplest solution of course is to
        define your own INIT method which calls this function.</p>
    <p class="Pp">NOTE:</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;initialize&quot;</span> detects that
        <span class="Li">&quot;initialize&quot;</span> has already been

  <dt id="uninitialize"><a class="permalink" href="#uninitialize"><b>uninitialize</b></a></dt>

  REDISPATCHING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">It is always useful to be able to re-dispatch your method call to
    the &quot;next most applicable method&quot;. This module provides a pseudo
    package along the lines of <span class="Li">&quot;SUPER::&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;NEXT::&quot;</span> which will re-dispatch the method
    along the C3 linearization. This is best shown with an example.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  # a classic diamond MI pattern ...
  #    &lt;A&gt;
  #   /   \
  # &lt;B&gt;   &lt;C&gt;
  #   \   /
  #    &lt;D&gt;

  package ClassA;
  use Class::C3;
  sub foo { 'ClassA::foo' }

  package ClassB;
  use base 'ClassA';
  use Class::C3;
  sub foo { 'ClassB::foo =&gt; ' . (shift)-&gt;next::method() }

  package ClassC;
  use base 'ClassA';
  use Class::C3;
  sub foo { 'ClassC::foo =&gt; ' . (shift)-&gt;next::method() }

  package ClassD;
  use base ('ClassB', 'ClassC');
  use Class::C3;
  sub foo { 'ClassD::foo =&gt; ' . (shift)-&gt;next::method() }

  print ClassD-&gt;foo; # prints out &quot;ClassD::foo =&gt; ClassB::foo =&gt; ClassC::foo =&gt; ClassA::foo&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A few things to note. First, we do not require you to add on the
    method name to the <span class="Li">&quot;next::method&quot;</span> call
    (this is unlike <span class="Li">&quot;NEXT::&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;SUPER::&quot;</span> which do require that). This
    helps to enforce the rule that you cannot dispatch to a method of a
    different name (this is how <span class="Li">&quot;NEXT::&quot;</span>
    behaves as well).</p>
<p class="Pp">The next thing to keep in mind is that you will need to pass all
    arguments to <span class="Li">&quot;next::method&quot;</span>. It can not
    automatically use the current <span class="Li">@_</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;next::method&quot;</span> cannot find a
    next method to re-dispatch the call to, it will throw an exception. You can
    use <span class="Li">&quot;next::can&quot;</span> to see if
    <span class="Li">&quot;next::method&quot;</span> will succeed before you
    call it like so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  $self-&gt;next::method(@_) if $self-&gt;next::can;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Additionally, you can use
    <span class="Li">&quot;maybe::next::method&quot;</span> as a shortcut to
    only call the next method if it exists. The previous example could be simply
    written as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  $self-&gt;maybe::next::method(@_);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There are some caveats about using
    <span class="Li">&quot;next::method&quot;</span>, see below for those.</p>

<p class="Pp">This module used to be labeled as <i>experimental</i>, however it
    has now been pretty heavily tested by the good folks over at DBIx::Class and
    I am confident this module is perfectly usable for whatever your needs might
    be.</p>
<p class="Pp">But there are still caveats, so here goes ...</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Use"><a class="permalink" href="#Use">Use of
    &quot;SUPER::&quot;.</a></dt>
  <dd>The idea of <span class="Li">&quot;SUPER::&quot;</span> under multiple
      inheritance is ambiguous, and generally not recommended anyway. However,
      its use in conjunction with this module is very much not recommended, and
      in fact very discouraged. The recommended approach is to instead use the
      supplied <span class="Li">&quot;next::method&quot;</span> feature, see
      more details on its usage above.</dd>
  <dt id="Changing"><a class="permalink" href="#Changing">Changing
    @ISA.</a></dt>
  <dd>It is the author's opinion that changing <span class="Li">@ISA</span> at
      runtime is pure insanity anyway. However, people do it, so I must caveat.
      Any changes to the <span class="Li">@ISA</span> will not be reflected in
      the MRO calculated by this module, and therefore probably won't even show
      up. If you do this, you will need to call
      <span class="Li">&quot;reinitialize&quot;</span> in order to recalculate
      <b>all</b> method dispatch tables. See the
      <span class="Li">&quot;reinitialize&quot;</span> documentation and an
      example in <i>t/20_reinitialize.t</i> for more information.</dd>
  <dt id="Adding/deleting"><a class="permalink" href="#Adding/deleting">Adding/deleting
    methods from class symbol tables.</a></dt>
  <dd>This module calculates the MRO for each requested class by interrogating
      the symbol tables of said classes. So any symbol table manipulation which
      takes place after our INIT phase is run will not be reflected in the
      calculated MRO. Just as with changing the <span class="Li">@ISA</span>,
      you will need to call <span class="Li">&quot;reinitialize&quot;</span> for
      any changes you make to take effect.</dd>
  <dt id="Calling"><a class="permalink" href="#Calling">Calling
    &quot;next::method&quot; from methods defined outside the class</a></dt>
  <dd>There is an edge case when using
      <span class="Li">&quot;next::method&quot;</span> from within a subroutine
      which was created in a different module than the one it is called from. It
      sounds complicated, but it really isn't. Here is an example which will not
      work correctly:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  *Foo::foo = sub { (shift)-&gt;next::method(@_) };
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The problem exists because the anonymous subroutine being
        assigned to the glob <span class="Li">*Foo::foo</span> will show up in
        the call stack as being called
        <span class="Li">&quot;__ANON__&quot;</span> and not
        <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span> as you might expect. Since
        <span class="Li">&quot;next::method&quot;</span> uses
        <span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span> to find the name of the
        method it was called in, it will fail in this case.</p>
    <p class="Pp">But fear not, there is a simple solution. The module
        <span class="Li">&quot;Sub::Name&quot;</span> will reach into the perl
        internals and assign a name to an anonymous subroutine for you. Simply
        do this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  use Sub::Name 'subname';
  *Foo::foo = subname 'Foo::foo' =&gt; sub { (shift)-&gt;next::method(@_) };
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">and things will Just Work. Of course this is not always
        possible to do, but to be honest, I just can't manage to find a
        workaround for it, so until someone gives me a working patch this will
        be a known limitation of this module.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="COMPATIBILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#COMPATIBILITY">COMPATIBILITY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If your software requires Perl 5.9.5 or higher, you do not need
    Class::C3, you can simply <span class="Li">&quot;use mro 'c3'&quot;</span>,
    and not worry about <span class="Li">&quot;initialize()&quot;</span>, avoid
    some of the above caveats, and get the best possible performance. See mro
    for more details.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your software is meant to work on earlier Perls, use Class::C3
    as documented here. Class::C3 will detect Perl 5.9.5+ and take advantage of

    running on a Perl version older than 5.9.5. The optional module will be
