  is Pegex?</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Pegex is a Friendly, Acmeist, PEG Parser framework. Friendly means
    that it is simple to create, understand, modify and maintain Pegex parsers.
    Acmeist means that the parsers will work automatically in many programming
    languages (as long as they have some kind of traditional &quot;regex&quot;
    support). PEG (Parser Expression Grammars) is the new style of
    Recursive-Descent/BNF style grammar definition syntax.</p>
<p class="Pp">The name &quot;Pegex&quot; comes from PEG + Regex. With Pegex you
    define top down grammars that eventually break down to regex fragments. ie
    The low level parsing matches are always done with regexes against the
    current position in the input stream.</p>

  is Parsing?</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">It may seem like a silly question, but it's important to have an
    understanding of what parsing is and what a parser can do for you. At the
    the most basic level &quot;parsing&quot; is the act of reading through an
    input, making sense of it, and possibly doing something with what is
  found.</p>
<p class="Pp">Usually a parser gets its instructions of what means what from
    something called a grammar. A grammar is a set of rules that defines how the
    input must be structured. In many parsing methodologies, input is
    preprocessed (possibly into tokens) before the parser/grammar get to look at
    it. Although this is a common method, it is not the only approach.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="How_Pegex_Works"><a class="permalink" href="#How_Pegex_Works">How
  Pegex Works</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Pegex parsing consists of 4 distinct parts or objects:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Parser"><a class="permalink" href="#Parser">Parser</a></dt>
  <dd>The Pegex parsing engine</dd>
  <dt id="Grammar"><a class="permalink" href="#Grammar">Grammar</a></dt>
  <dd>The rules of a particular syntax</dd>
  <dt id="Receiver"><a class="permalink" href="#Receiver">Receiver</a></dt>
  <dd>The logic for processing matches</dd>
  <dt id="Input"><a class="permalink" href="#Input">Input</a></dt>
  <dd>Text conforming to the grammar rules</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Quite simply, a parser object is created with a grammar object and
    a receiver object. Then the parser object's
    <span class="Li">&quot;parse()&quot;</span> method is called on an input
    object. The parser applies the rules of the grammar to the input and invokes
    methods of the receiver as the rules match. The parse is either successful
    or results in an error. The result is whatever the receiver object decides
    it should be.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example consider a parser that turns the Markdown text
    language into HTML. The Pegex code to use this might look like this:</p>
<p class="Pp">In the simplest terms, Pegex works like this (pseudocode):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    parser = new Pegex.Parser(
        grammar: new Markdown.Grammar
        receiver: new Markdown.Receiver.HTML
    )
    html = parser.parse(markdown)
</pre>
