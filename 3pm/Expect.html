<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">See an explanation of What is Expect
    &lt;http://code-maven.com/expect&gt;</p>
<p class="Pp">The Expect module is a successor of Comm.pl and a descendent of
    Chat.pl. It more closely resembles the Tcl Expect language than its
    predecessors. It does not contain any of the networking code found in
    Comm.pl. I suspect this would be obsolete anyway given the advent of
    IO::Socket and external tools such as netcat.</p>
<p class="Pp">Expect.pm is an attempt to have more of a <b>switch()</b> &amp;
    case feeling to make decision processing more fluid. Three separate types of
    debugging have been implemented to make code production easier.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is possible to interconnect multiple file handles (and
    processes) much like Tcl's Expect. An attempt was made to enable all the
    features of Tcl's Expect without forcing Tcl on the victim programmer :-)
  .</p>
<p class="Pp">Please, before you consider using Expect, read the FAQs about
    &quot;I want to automate password entry for su/ssh/scp/rsh/...&quot; and
    &quot;I want to use Expect to automate [anything with a
  buzzword]...&quot;</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="new"><a class="permalink" href="#new">new</a></dt>
  <dd>Creates a new Expect object, i.e. a pty. You can change parameters on it
      before actually spawning a command. This is important if you want to
      modify the terminal settings for the slave. See <b>slave()</b> below. The
      object returned is actually a reblessed IO::Pty filehandle, so see there
      for additional methods.</dd>
  <dt id="Expect"><a class="permalink" href="#Expect">Expect-&gt;exp_init(\*FILEHANDLE)
    <i>or</i></a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="Expect~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Expect~2">Expect-&gt;init(\*FILEHANDLE)</a></dt>
  <dd>Initializes <span class="Li">$new_handle_object</span> for use with other
      Expect functions. It must be passed a <b>_reference_</b> to FILEHANDLE if
      you want it to work properly. IO::File objects are preferable. Returns a
      reference to the newly created object.
    <p class="Pp">You can use only real filehandles, certain tied filehandles
        (e.g. Net::SSH2) that lack a <b>fileno()</b> will not work. Net::Telnet
        objects can be used but have been reported to work only for certain
        hosts. YMMV.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Expect~3"><a class="permalink" href="#Expect~3">Expect-&gt;spawn($command,
    @parameters) <i>or</i></a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>$object-&gt;spawn($command, @parameters) <i>or</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="Expect~4"><a class="permalink" href="#Expect~4">Expect-&gt;new($command,
    @parameters)</a></dt>
  <dd>Forks and execs <span class="Li">$command</span>. Returns an Expect object
      upon success or <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> if the fork was
      unsuccessful or the command could not be found. <b>spawn()</b> passes its
      parameters unchanged to Perls <b>exec()</b>, so look there for detailed
      semantics.
    <p class="Pp">Note that if spawn cannot <b>exec()</b> the given command, the
        Expect object is still valid and the next <b>expect()</b> will see
        &quot;Cannot exec&quot;, so you can use that for error handling.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also note that you cannot reuse an object with an already
        spawned command, even if that command has exited. Sorry, but you have to
        allocate a new object...</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$object-&gt;debug(0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | undef)</dt>
  <dd>Sets debug level for <span class="Li">$object</span>. 1 refers to general
      debugging information, 2 refers to verbose debugging and 0 refers to no
      debugging. If you call <b>debug()</b> with no parameters it will return
      the current debugging level. When the object is created the debugging
      level will match that <span class="Li">$Expect::Debug</span>, normally 0.
    <p class="Pp">The '3' setting is new with 1.05, and adds the additional
        functionality of having the _full_ accumulated buffer printed every time
        data is read from an Expect object. This was implemented by request. I
        recommend against using this unless you think you need it as it can
        create quite a quantity of output under some circumstances..</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$object-&gt;exp_internal(1 | 0)</dt>
  <dd>Sets/unsets 'exp_internal' debugging. This is similar in nature to its Tcl
      counterpart. It is extremely valuable when debugging <b>expect()</b>
      sequences. When the object is created the exp_internal setting will match
      the value of <span class="Li">$Expect::Exp_Internal</span>, normally 0.
      Returns the current setting if called without parameters. It is highly
      recommended that you make use of the debugging features lest you have
      angry code.</dd>
  <dt>$object-&gt;raw_pty(1 | 0)</dt>
  <dd>Set pty to raw mode before spawning. This disables echoing, CR-&gt;LF
      translation and an ugly hack for broken Solaris TTYs (which send
      &lt;space&gt;&lt;backspace&gt; to slow things down) and thus gives a more
      pipe-like behaviour (which is important if you want to transfer binary
      content). Note that this must be set <i>before</i> spawning the
    program.</dd>
  <dt>$object-&gt;stty(qw(mode1 mode2...))</dt>
  <dd>Sets the tty mode for <span class="Li">$object</span>'s associated
      terminal to the given modes. Note that on many systems the master side of
      the pty is not a tty, so you have to modify the slave pty instead, see
      next item. This needs IO::Stty installed, which is no longer
    required.</dd>
  <dt>$object-&gt;<b>slave()</b></dt>
  <dd>Returns a filehandle to the slave part of the pty. Very useful in
      modifying the terminal settings:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  $object-&gt;slave-&gt;stty(qw(raw -echo));
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Typical values are 'sane', 'raw', and 'raw -echo'. Note that I
        recommend setting the terminal to 'raw' or 'raw -echo', as this avoids a
        lot of hassle and gives pipe-like (i.e. transparent) behaviour (without
        the buffering issue).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$object-&gt;print(@strings) <i>or</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>$object-&gt;send(@strings)</dt>
  <dd>Sends the given strings to the spawned command. Note that the strings are
      not logged in the logfile (see print_log_file) but will probably be echoed
      back by the pty, depending on pty settings (default is echo) and thus end
      up there anyway. This must also be taken into account when
      <b>expect()</b>ing for an answer: the next string will be the command just
      sent. I suggest setting the pty to raw, which disables echo and makes the
      pty transparently act like a bidirectional pipe.</dd>

  <dt id="Simple"><a class="permalink" href="#Simple">Simple interface</a></dt>
  <dd>Given <span class="Li">$timeout</span> in seconds Expect will wait for
      <span class="Li">$object</span>'s handle to produce one of the
      match_patterns, which are matched exactly by default. If you want a regexp
      match, prefix the pattern with '-re'.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  $object-&gt;expect(15, 'match me exactly','-re','match\s+me\s+exactly');
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Due to o/s limitations <span class="Li">$timeout</span> should
        be a round number. If <span class="Li">$timeout</span> is 0 Expect will
        check one time to see if <span class="Li">$object</span>'s handle
        contains any of the match_patterns. If <span class="Li">$timeout</span>
        is undef Expect will wait forever for a pattern to match.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If called in a scalar context, <b>expect()</b> will return the
        position of the matched pattern within
        <span class="Li">@matched_patterns</span>, or undef if no pattern was
        matched. This is a position starting from 1, so if you want to know
        which of an array of <span class="Li">@matched_patterns</span> matched
        you should subtract one from the return value.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If called in an array context <b>expect()</b> will return

    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$matched_pattern_position</span> will contain
        the value that would have been returned if <b>expect()</b> had been
        called in a scalar context.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$error</span> is the error that occurred that
        caused <b>expect()</b> to return. <span class="Li">$error</span> will
        contain a number followed by a string equivalent expressing the nature
        of the error. Possible values are undef, indicating no error,
        '1:TIMEOUT' indicating that <span class="Li">$timeout</span> seconds had
        elapsed without a match, '2:EOF' indicating an eof was read from
        <span class="Li">$object</span>, '3: spawn id($fileno) died' indicating
        that the process exited before matching and '4:$!' indicating whatever
        error was set in <span class="Li">$ERRNO</span> during the last read on
        <span class="Li">$object</span>'s handle or during <b>select()</b>. All
        handles indicated by set_group plus STDOUT will have all data to come
        out of <span class="Li">$object</span> printed to them during
        <b>expect()</b> if log_group and log_stdout are set.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$successfully_matching_string</span>
        <span class="Li">$before_match</span>
        <span class="Li">$after_match</span></p>
    <p class="Pp">Changed from older versions is the regular expression
        handling. By default now all strings passed to <b>expect()</b> are
        treated as literals. To match a regular expression pass '-re' as a
        parameter in front of the pattern you want to match as a regexp.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This change makes it possible to match literals and regular
        expressions in the same <b>expect()</b> call.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also new is multiline matching. ^ will now match the beginning
        of lines. Unfortunately, because perl doesn't use $/ in determining
        where lines break using $ to find the end of a line frequently doesn't
        work. This is because your terminal is returning &quot;\r\n&quot; at the
        end of every line. One way to check for a pattern at the end of a line
        would be to use \r?$ instead of $.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example: Spawning telnet to a host, you might look for the
        escape character. telnet would return to you &quot;\r\nEscape character
        is '^]'.\r\n&quot;. To find this you might use
        <span class="Li">$match</span>='^Escape char.*\.\r?$';</p>

      since the escape sequence is _read_ from an object. Further note that the

      of <span class="Li">@objects</span> _as well as every member of its listen
      group_ will be set to 'raw -echo' for the duration of interconnection.
      Setting <span class="Li">$object</span>-&gt;<b>manual_stty()</b> will stop

        If you have this on you can match lines in the middle of a page of

    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$Expect::Multiline_Matching</span> turns
        on and off Expect's multi-line matching mode. But this only has an
        effect if you pass in a string, and then use '-re' mode. If you pass in
        a regular expression value (via qr//), then the qr//'s own flags are
        preserved irrespective of what it gets interpolated into. There was a
        bug in Perl 5.8.x where interpolating a regex without /m into a match
        with /m would incorrectly apply the /m to the inner regex too, but this
        was fixed in Perl 5.10. The correct behavior, as seen in Perl 5.10, is
        that if you pass in a regex (via qr//), then
        <span class="Li">$Expect::Multiline_Matching</span> has no effect. So if
        you pass in a regex, then you must use the qr's flags to control whether
        it is multiline (which by default it is not, opposite of the default
        behavior of Expect).</p>

    for communication between two programs (no more unexpected character
    translations). Unfortunately this would break a lot of old code that sends
    &quot;\r&quot; to the program instead of &quot;\n&quot; (translating this is

  do I send control characters to a process?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A: You can send any characters to a process with the print
    command. To represent a control character in Perl, use \c followed by the
    letter. For example, control-G can be represented with &quot;\cG&quot; .
    Note that this will not work if you single-quote your string. So, to send
    control-C to a process in <span class="Li">$exp</span>, do:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  print $exp &quot;\cC&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or, if you prefer:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $exp-&gt;send(&quot;\cC&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The ability to include control characters in a string like this is
    provided by Perl, not by Expect.pm . Trying to learn Expect.pm without a
    thorough grounding in Perl can be very daunting. We suggest you look into
    some of the excellent Perl learning material, such as the books _Programming
    Perl_ and _Learning Perl_ by O'Reilly, as well as the extensive online Perl
    documentation available through the perldoc command.</p>

    root passwords, into scripts in clear text can mean severe security
    problems. I strongly recommend using other means. For 'su', consider
    switching to 'sudo', which gives you root access on a per-command and
    per-user basis without the need to enter passwords. 'ssh'/'scp' can be set
    up with RSA authentication without passwords. 'rsh' can use the .rhost
    mechanism, but I'd strongly suggest to switch to 'ssh'; to mention 'rsh' and
    'security' in the same sentence makes an oxymoron.</p>
<p class="Pp">It will work for 'telnet', though, and there are valid uses for
    it, but you still might want to consider using 'ssh', as keeping cleartext
    passwords around is very insecure.</p>

<p class="Pp">Are you sure there is no other, easier way? As a rule of thumb,
    Expect is useful for automating things that expect to talk to a human, where
    no formal standard applies. For other tasks that do follow a well-defined
    protocol, there are often better-suited modules that already can handle
    those protocols. Don't try to do HTTP requests by spawning telnet to port
    80, use LWP instead. To automate FTP, take a look at Net::FTP or
    <span class="Li">&quot;ncftp&quot;</span> (http://www.ncftp.org). You don't
    use a screwdriver to hammer in your nails either, or do you?</p>

<p class="Pp">What's happening is you are closing the handle before passwd
    exits. When you close the handle to a process, it is sent a signal
    (SIGPIPE?) telling it that STDOUT has gone away. The default behavior for
    processes is to die in this circumstance. Two ways you can make this not
    happen are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $process-&gt;soft_close();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will wait 15 seconds for a process to come up with an EOF by
    itself before killing it.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $process-&gt;expect(undef);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will wait forever for the process to match an empty set of
    patterns. It will return when the process hits an EOF.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a rule, you should always <b>expect()</b> the result of your
    transaction before you continue with processing.</p>

<p class="Pp">Output is only printed to the logfile/group when Expect reads from

  seem to have problems with terminal settings, double echoing, etc.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Tty settings are a major pain to keep track of. If you find
    unexpected behavior such as double-echoing or a frozen session, doublecheck
    the documentation for default settings. When in doubt, handle them yourself
    using <span class="Li">$exp</span>-&gt;<b>stty()</b> and
    <b>manual_stty()</b> functions. As of .98 you shouldn't have to worry about
    stty settings getting fouled unless you use interconnect or intentionally
    change them (like doing -echo to get a password).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you foul up your terminal's tty settings, kill any hung
    processes and enter 'stty sane' at a shell prompt. This should make your
    terminal manageable again.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that IO::Tty returns ptys with your systems default setting
    regarding echoing, CRLF translation etc. and Expect does not change them. I
    have considered setting the ptys to 'raw' without any translation
    whatsoever, but this would break a lot of existing things, as '\r'
    translation would not work anymore. On the other hand, a raw pty works much
    like a pipe and is more WYGIWYE (what you get is what you expect), so I
    suggest you set it to 'raw' by yourself:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $exp = Expect-&gt;new;
  $exp-&gt;raw_pty(1);
  $exp-&gt;spawn(...);

  spawning a telnet/ssh session and then let the user interact with it. But
  screen-oriented applications on the other side don't work properly.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You have to set the terminal screen size for that. Luckily,
    IO::Pty already has a method for that, so modify your code to look like
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my $exp = Expect-&gt;new;
  $exp-&gt;slave-&gt;clone_winsize_from(\*STDIN);
  $exp-&gt;spawn(&quot;telnet somehost);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Also, some applications need the TERM shell variable set so they
    know how to move the cursor across the screen. When logging in, the remote
    shell sends a query (Ctrl-Z I think) and expects the terminal to answer with
    a string, e.g. 'xterm'. If you really want to go that way (be aware, madness
    lies at its end), you can handle that and send back the value in
    <span class="Li">$ENV</span>{TERM}. This is only a hand-waving explanation,
    please figure out the details by yourself.</p>

  application does not notice this.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You have to catch the signal WINCH (&quot;window size
    changed&quot;), change the terminal size and propagate the signal to the
    spawned application:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my $exp = Expect-&gt;new;
  $exp-&gt;slave-&gt;clone_winsize_from(\*STDIN);
  $exp-&gt;spawn(&quot;ssh somehost);

  }
  $exp-&gt;interact();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There is an example file ssh.pl in the examples/ subdir that shows
    how this works with ssh. Please note that I do strongly object against using
    Expect to automate ssh login, as there are better way to do that (see
