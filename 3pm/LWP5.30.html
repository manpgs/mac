<p class="Pp">The libwww-perl collection is a set of Perl modules which provides
    a simple and consistent application programming interface (API) to the
    World-Wide Web. The main focus of the library is to provide classes and
    functions that allow you to write WWW clients. The library also contain
    modules that are of more general use and even classes that help you
    implement simple HTTP servers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most modules in this library provide an object oriented API. The
    user agent, requests sent and responses received from the WWW server are all
    represented by objects. This makes a simple and powerful interface to these
    services. The interface is easy to extend and customize for your own
  needs.</p>
<p class="Pp">The main features of the library are:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Contains various reusable components (modules) that can be used separately
      or together.</li>
  <li>Provides an object oriented model of HTTP-style communication. Within this
      framework we currently support access to
      <span class="Li">&quot;http&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;https&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;gopher&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;ftp&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;news&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;file&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;mailto&quot;</span> resources.</li>
  <li>Provides a full object oriented interface or a very simple procedural
      interface.</li>
  <li>Supports the basic and digest authorization schemes.</li>
  <li>Supports transparent redirect handling.</li>
  <li>Supports access through proxy servers.</li>
  <li>Provides parser for <i>robots.txt</i> files and a framework for
      constructing robots.</li>
  <li>Supports parsing of HTML forms.</li>
  <li>Implements HTTP content negotiation algorithm that can be used both in
      protocol modules and in server scripts (like CGI scripts).</li>
  <li>Supports HTTP cookies.</li>
  <li>Some simple command line clients, for instance
      <span class="Li">&quot;lwp-request&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;lwp-download&quot;</span>.</li>
</ul>

<h1 class="Sh" id="HTTP_STYLE_COMMUNICATION"><a class="permalink" href="#HTTP_STYLE_COMMUNICATION">HTTP
  STYLE COMMUNICATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The libwww-perl library is based on HTTP style communication. This
    section tries to describe what that means.</p>
<p class="Pp">Let us start with this quote from the HTTP specification document
    &lt;URL:http://www.w3.org/Protocols/&gt;:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>The HTTP protocol is based on a request/response paradigm. A client
      establishes a connection with a server and sends a request to the server
      in the form of a request method, URI, and protocol version, followed by a
      MIME-like message containing request modifiers, client information, and
      possible body content. The server responds with a status line, including
      the message's protocol version and a success or error code, followed by a
      MIME-like message containing server information, entity meta-information,
      and possible body content.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">What this means to libwww-perl is that communication always take
    place through these steps: First a <i>request</i> object is created and
    configured. This object is then passed to a server and we get a
    <i>response</i> object in return that we can examine. A request is always
    independent of any previous requests, i.e. the service is stateless. The
    same simple model is used for any kind of service we want to access.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, if we want to fetch a document from a remote file
    server, then we send it a request that contains a name for that document and
    the response will contain the document itself. If we access a search engine,
    then the content of the request will contain the query parameters and the
    response will contain the query result. If we want to send a mail message to
    somebody then we send a request object which contains our message to the
    mail server and the response object will contain an acknowledgment that
    tells us that the message has been accepted and will be forwarded to the
    recipient(s).</p>
<p class="Pp">It is as simple as that!</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Request_Object"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Request_Object">The
  Request Object</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The libwww-perl request object has the class name HTTP::Request.
    The fact that the class name uses <span class="Li">&quot;HTTP::&quot;</span>
    as a prefix only implies that we use the HTTP model of communication. It
    does not limit the kind of services we can try to pass this <i>request</i>
    to. For instance, we will send HTTP::Requests both to ftp and gopher
    servers, as well as to the local file system.</p>
<p class="Pp">The main attributes of the request objects are:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><b>method</b> is a short string that tells what kind of request this is.
      The most common methods are <b>GET</b>, <b>PUT</b>, <b>POST</b> and
      <b>HEAD</b>.</li>
  <li><b>uri</b> is a string denoting the protocol, server and the name of the
      &quot;document&quot; we want to access. The <b>uri</b> might also encode
      various other parameters.</li>
  <li><b>headers</b> contains additional information about the request and can
      also used to describe the content. The headers are a set of keyword/value
      pairs.</li>
  <li><b>content</b> is an arbitrary amount of data.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Response_Object"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Response_Object">The
  Response Object</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The libwww-perl response object has the class name HTTP::Response.
    The main attributes of objects of this class are:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><b>code</b> is a numerical value that indicates the overall outcome of the
      request.</li>
  <li><b>message</b> is a short, human readable string that corresponds to the
      <i>code</i>.</li>
  <li><b>headers</b> contains additional information about the response and
      describe the content.</li>
  <li><b>content</b> is an arbitrary amount of data.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Since we don't want to handle all possible <i>code</i> values
    directly in our programs, a libwww-perl response object has methods that can
    be used to query what kind of response this is. The most commonly used
    response classification methods are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="is_success()"><a class="permalink" href="#is_success()"><b>is_success()</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The request was successfully received, understood or accepted.</dd>
  <dt id="is_error()"><a class="permalink" href="#is_error()"><b>is_error()</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The request failed. The server or the resource might not be available,
      access to the resource might be denied or other things might have failed
      for some reason.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_User_Agent"><a class="permalink" href="#The_User_Agent">The
  User Agent</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Let us assume that we have created a <i>request</i> object. What
    do we actually do with it in order to receive a <i>response</i>?</p>
<p class="Pp">The answer is that you pass it to a <i>user agent</i> object and
    this object takes care of all the things that need to be done (like
    low-level communication and error handling) and returns a <i>response</i>
    object. The user agent represents your application on the network and
    provides you with an interface that can accept <i>requests</i> and return
    <i>responses</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The user agent is an interface layer between your application code
    and the network. Through this interface you are able to access the various
    servers on the network.</p>
<p class="Pp">The class name for the user agent is LWP::UserAgent. Every
    libwww-perl application that wants to communicate should create at least one
    object of this class. The main method provided by this object is
    <b>request()</b>. This method takes an HTTP::Request object as argument and
    (eventually) returns a HTTP::Response object.</p>
<p class="Pp">The user agent has many other attributes that let you configure
    how it will interact with the network and with your application.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><b>timeout</b> specifies how much time we give remote servers to respond
      before the library disconnects and creates an internal <i>timeout</i>
      response.</li>
  <li><b>agent</b> specifies the name that your application uses when it
      presents itself on the network.</li>
  <li><b>from</b> can be set to the e-mail address of the person responsible for
      running the application. If this is set, then the address will be sent to
      the servers with every request.</li>
  <li><b>parse_head</b> specifies whether we should initialize response headers
      from the &lt;head&gt; section of HTML documents.</li>
  <li><b>proxy</b> and <b>no_proxy</b> specify if and when to go through a proxy
      server. &lt;URL:http://www.w3.org/History/1994/WWW/Proxies/&gt;</li>
  <li><b>credentials</b> provides a way to set up user names and passwords
      needed to access certain services.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Many applications want even more control over how they interact
    with the network and they get this by sub-classing LWP::UserAgent. The
    library includes a sub-class, LWP::RobotUA, for robot applications.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="An_Example"><a class="permalink" href="#An_Example">An
  Example</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This example shows how the user agent, a request and a response
    are represented in actual perl code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  # Create a user agent object
  use LWP::UserAgent;
  my $ua = LWP::UserAgent-&gt;new;
  $ua-&gt;agent(&quot;MyApp/0.1 &quot;);
  # Create a request
  my $req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(POST =&gt; 'http://search.cpan.org/search');
  $req-&gt;content_type('application/x-www-form-urlencoded');
  $req-&gt;content('query=libwww-perl&amp;mode=dist');
  # Pass request to the user agent and get a response back
  my $res = $ua-&gt;request($req);
  # Check the outcome of the response
  if ($res-&gt;is_success) {
      print $res-&gt;content;
  }
  else {
      print $res-&gt;status_line, &quot;\n&quot;;
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$ua</span> is created once when the
    application starts up. New request objects should normally created for each
    request sent.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NETWORK_SUPPORT"><a class="permalink" href="#NETWORK_SUPPORT">NETWORK
  SUPPORT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This section discusses the various protocol schemes and the HTTP
    style methods that headers may be used for each.</p>
<p class="Pp">For all requests, a &quot;User-Agent&quot; header is added and
    initialized from the <span class="Li">$ua</span>-&gt;agent attribute before
    the request is handed to the network layer. In the same way, a
    &quot;From&quot; header is initialized from the
    <span class="Li">$ua</span>-&gt;from attribute.</p>
<p class="Pp">For all responses, the library adds a header called
    &quot;Client-Date&quot;. This header holds the time when the response was
    received by your application. The format and semantics of the header are the
    same as the server created &quot;Date&quot; header. You may also encounter
    other &quot;Client-XXX&quot; headers. They are all generated by the library
    internally and are not received from the servers.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">HTTP Requests</h2>
<p class="Pp">HTTP requests are just handed off to an HTTP server and it decides
    what happens. Few servers implement methods beside the usual
    &quot;GET&quot;, &quot;HEAD&quot;, &quot;POST&quot; and &quot;PUT&quot;, but
    CGI-scripts may implement any method they like.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the server is not available then the library will generate an
    internal error response.</p>
<p class="Pp">The library automatically adds a &quot;Host&quot; and a
    &quot;Content-Length&quot; header to the HTTP request before it is sent over
    the network.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a GET request you might want to add a
    &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot; or &quot;If-None-Match&quot; header to make
    the request conditional.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a POST request you should add the &quot;Content-Type&quot;
    header. When you try to emulate HTML &lt;FORM&gt; handling you should
    usually let the value of the &quot;Content-Type&quot; header be
    &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;. See lwpcook for examples of
    this.</p>
<p class="Pp">The libwww-perl HTTP implementation currently support the HTTP/1.1
    and HTTP/1.0 protocol.</p>
<p class="Pp">The library allows you to access proxy server through HTTP. This
    means that you can set up the library to forward all types of request
    through the HTTP protocol module. See LWP::UserAgent for documentation of
    this.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">HTTPS Requests</h2>
<p class="Pp">HTTPS requests are HTTP requests over an encrypted network
    connection using the SSL protocol developed by Netscape. Everything about
    HTTP requests above also apply to HTTPS requests. In addition the library
    will add the headers &quot;Client-SSL-Cipher&quot;,
    &quot;Client-SSL-Cert-Subject&quot; and &quot;Client-SSL-Cert-Issuer&quot;
    to the response. These headers denote the encryption method used and the
    name of the server owner.</p>
<p class="Pp">The request can contain the header &quot;If-SSL-Cert-Subject&quot;
    in order to make the request conditional on the content of the server
    certificate. If the certificate subject does not match, no request is sent
    to the server and an internally generated error response is returned. The
    value of the &quot;If-SSL-Cert-Subject&quot; header is interpreted as a Perl
    regular expression.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">FTP Requests</h2>
<p class="Pp">The library currently supports GET, HEAD and PUT requests. GET
    retrieves a file or a directory listing from an FTP server. PUT stores a
    file on a ftp server.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can specify a ftp account for servers that want this in
    addition to user name and password. This is specified by including an
    &quot;Account&quot; header in the request.</p>
<p class="Pp">User name/password can be specified using basic authorization or
    be encoded in the URL. Failed logins return an UNAUTHORIZED response with
    &quot;WWW-Authenticate: Basic&quot; and can be treated like basic
    authorization for HTTP.</p>
<p class="Pp">The library supports ftp ASCII transfer mode by specifying the
    &quot;type=a&quot; parameter in the URL. It also supports transfer of ranges
    for FTP transfers using the &quot;Range&quot; header.</p>
<p class="Pp">Directory listings are by default returned unprocessed (as
    returned from the ftp server) with the content media type reported to be
    &quot;text/ftp-dir-listing&quot;. The File::Listing module provides methods
    for parsing of these directory listing.</p>
<p class="Pp">The ftp module is also able to convert directory listings to HTML
    and this can be requested via the standard HTTP content negotiation
    mechanisms (add an &quot;Accept: text/html&quot; header in the request if
    you want this).</p>
<p class="Pp">For normal file retrievals, the &quot;Content-Type&quot; is
    guessed based on the file name suffix. See LWP::MediaTypes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot; request header works for servers
    that implement the <span class="Li">&quot;MDTM&quot;</span> command. It will
    probably not work for directory listings though.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(GET =&gt; 'ftp://me:passwd@ftp.some.where.com/');
  $req-&gt;header(Accept =&gt; &quot;text/html, */*;q=0.1&quot;);
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="News_Requests"><a class="permalink" href="#News_Requests">News
  Requests</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Access to the USENET News system is implemented through the NNTP
    protocol. The name of the news server is obtained from the NNTP_SERVER
    environment variable and defaults to &quot;news&quot;. It is not possible to
    specify the hostname of the NNTP server in news: URLs.</p>
<p class="Pp">The library supports GET and HEAD to retrieve news articles
    through the NNTP protocol. You can also post articles to newsgroups by using
    (surprise!) the POST method.</p>
<p class="Pp">GET on newsgroups is not implemented yet.</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(GET =&gt; 'news:abc1234@a.sn.no');
  $req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(POST =&gt; 'news:comp.lang.perl.test');
  $req-&gt;header(Subject =&gt; 'This is a test',
               From    =&gt; 'me@some.where.org');
  $req-&gt;content(&lt;&lt;EOT);
  This is the content of the message that we are sending to
  the world.
  EOT

</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Gopher_Request"><a class="permalink" href="#Gopher_Request">Gopher
  Request</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The library supports the GET and HEAD methods for gopher requests.
    All request header values are ignored. HEAD cheats and returns a response
    without even talking to server.</p>
<p class="Pp">Gopher menus are always converted to HTML.</p>
<p class="Pp">The response &quot;Content-Type&quot; is generated from the
    document type encoded (as the first letter) in the request URL path
  itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(GET =&gt; 'gopher://gopher.sn.no/');
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="File_Request"><a class="permalink" href="#File_Request">File
  Request</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The library supports GET and HEAD methods for file requests. The
    &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot; header is supported. All other headers are
    ignored. The <i>host</i> component of the file URL must be empty or set to
    &quot;localhost&quot;. Any other <i>host</i> value will be treated as an
    error.</p>
<p class="Pp">Directories are always converted to an HTML document. For normal
    files, the &quot;Content-Type&quot; and &quot;Content-Encoding&quot; in the
    response are guessed based on the file suffix.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(GET =&gt; 'file:/etc/passwd');
</pre>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Mailto_Request"><a class="permalink" href="#Mailto_Request">Mailto
  Request</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You can send (aka &quot;POST&quot;) mail messages using the
    library. All headers specified for the request are passed on to the mail
    system. The &quot;To&quot; header is initialized from the mail address in
    the URL.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $req = HTTP::Request-&gt;new(POST =&gt; 'mailto:libwww@perl.org');
  $req-&gt;header(Subject =&gt; &quot;subscribe&quot;);
  $req-&gt;content(&quot;Please subscribe me to the libwww-perl mailing list!\n&quot;);

</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">CPAN Requests</h2>
<p class="Pp">URLs with scheme <span class="Li">&quot;cpan:&quot;</span> are
    redirected to a suitable CPAN mirror. If you have your own local mirror of
    CPAN you might tell LWP to use it for
    <span class="Li">&quot;cpan:&quot;</span> URLs by an assignment like
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $LWP::Protocol::cpan::CPAN = &quot;file:/local/CPAN/&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Suitable CPAN mirrors are also picked up from the configuration
    for the CPAN.pm, so if you have used that module a suitable mirror should be
    picked automatically. If neither of these apply, then a redirect to the
    generic CPAN http location is issued.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example request to download the newest perl:</p>
