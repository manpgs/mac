  <dt id="How"><a class="permalink" href="#How">How do I install a module into
    my home directory?</a></dt>
  <dd>If you're not the Perl administrator you probably don't have permission to
      install a module to its default location. Ways of handling this with a
      <b>lot</b> less manual effort on your part are perlbrew and local::lib.
    <p class="Pp">Otherwise, you can install it for your own use into your home
        directory like so:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # Non-unix folks, replace ~ with /path/to/your/home/dir
    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=~
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This will put modules into <i>~/lib/perl5</i>, man pages into
        <i>~/man</i> and programs into <i>~/bin</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To ensure your Perl programs can see these newly installed
        modules, set your <span class="Li">&quot;PERL5LIB&quot;</span>
        environment variable to <i>~/lib/perl5</i> or tell each of your programs
        to look in that directory with the following:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use lib &quot;$ENV{HOME}/lib/perl5&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or if <span class="Li">$ENV</span>{HOME} isn't set and you
        don't want to set it for some reason, do it the long way.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use lib &quot;/path/to/your/home/dir/lib/perl5&quot;;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="How~2"><a class="permalink" href="#How~2">How do I get MakeMaker and
    Module::Build to install to the same place?</a></dt>
  <dd>Module::Build, as of 0.28, supports two ways to install to the same
      location as MakeMaker.
    <p class="Pp">We highly recommend the install_base method, its the simplest
        and most closely approximates the expected behavior of an installation
        prefix.</p>
    <p class="Pp">1) Use INSTALL_BASE /
        <span class="Li">&quot;--install_base&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="Pp">MakeMaker (as of 6.31) and Module::Build (as of 0.28) both can
        install to the same locations using the &quot;install_base&quot;
        concept. See &quot;INSTALL_BASE&quot; in ExtUtils::MakeMaker for
        details. To get MM and MB to install to the same location simply set
        INSTALL_BASE in MM and
        <span class="Li">&quot;--install_base&quot;</span> in MB to the same
        location.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=/whatever
    perl Build.PL    --install_base /whatever
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This works most like other language's behavior when you
        specify a prefix. We recommend this method.</p>
    <p class="Pp">2) Use PREFIX /
      <span class="Li">&quot;--prefix&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="Pp">Module::Build 0.28 added support for
        <span class="Li">&quot;--prefix&quot;</span> which works like
        MakeMaker's PREFIX.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/whatever
    perl Build.PL    --prefix /whatever
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">We highly discourage this method. It should only be used if
        you know what you're doing and specifically need the PREFIX behavior.
        The PREFIX algorithm is complicated and focused on matching the system
        installation.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="How~3"><a class="permalink" href="#How~3">How do I keep from
    installing man pages?</a></dt>
  <dd>Recent versions of MakeMaker will only install man pages on Unix-like
      operating systems by default. To generate manpages on non-Unix operating
      systems, make the &quot;manifypods&quot; target.
    <p class="Pp">For an individual module:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        perl Makefile.PL INSTALLMAN1DIR=none INSTALLMAN3DIR=none
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you want to suppress man page installation for all modules
        you have to reconfigure Perl and tell it 'none' when it asks where to
        install man pages.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="How~4"><a class="permalink" href="#How~4">How do I use a module
    without installing it?</a></dt>
  <dd>Two ways. One is to build the module normally...
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">...and then use blib to point Perl at the built but
        uninstalled module:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        perl -Mblib script.pl
        perl -Mblib -e '...'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The other is to install the module in a temporary
      location.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        perl Makefile.PL INSTALL_BASE=~/tmp
        make
        make test
        make install
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">And then set PERL5LIB to <i>~/tmp/lib/perl5</i>. This works
        well when you have multiple modules to work with. It also ensures that
        the module goes through its full installation process which may modify
        it. Again, local::lib may assist you here.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="How~5"><a class="permalink" href="#How~5">How can I organize tests
    into subdirectories and have them run?</a></dt>
  <dd>Let's take the following test directory structure:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    t/foo/sometest.t
    t/bar/othertest.t
    t/bar/baz/anothertest.t
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Now, inside of the
        <span class="Li">&quot;WriteMakeFile()&quot;</span> function in your
        <i>Makefile.PL</i>, specify where your tests are located with the
        <span class="Li">&quot;test&quot;</span> directive:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    test =&gt; {TESTS =&gt; 't/*.t t/*/*.t t/*/*/*.t'}
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The first entry in the string will run all tests in the
        top-level <i>t/</i> directory. The second will run all test files
        located in any subdirectory under <i>t/</i>. The third, runs all test
        files within any subdirectory within any other subdirectory located
        under <i>t/</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that you do not have to use wildcards. You can specify
        explicitly which subdirectories to run tests in:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    test =&gt; {TESTS =&gt; 't/*.t t/foo/*.t t/bar/baz/*.t'}
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="PREFIX"><a class="permalink" href="#PREFIX">PREFIX vs INSTALL_BASE
    from Module::Build::Cookbook</a></dt>
  <dd>The behavior of PREFIX is complicated and depends closely on how your Perl
      is configured. The resulting installation locations will vary from machine
      to machine and even different installations of Perl on the same machine.
      Because of this, its difficult to document where prefix will place your
      modules.
    <p class="Pp">In contrast, INSTALL_BASE has predictable, easy to explain
        installation locations. Now that Module::Build and MakeMaker both have
        INSTALL_BASE there is little reason to use PREFIX other than to preserve
        your existing installation locations. If you are starting a fresh Perl
        installation we encourage you to use INSTALL_BASE. If you have an
        existing installation installed via PREFIX, consider moving it to an
        installation structure matching INSTALL_BASE and using that instead.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Generating"><a class="permalink" href="#Generating">Generating *.pm
    files with substitutions eg of $VERSION</a></dt>
  <dd>If you want to configure your module files for local conditions, or to
      automatically insert a version number, you can use EUMM's
      <span class="Li">&quot;PL_FILES&quot;</span> capability, where it will
      automatically run each <i>*.PL</i> it finds to generate its basename. For
      instance:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # Makefile.PL:
    require 'common.pl';
    my $version = get_version();
    my @pms = qw(Foo.pm);
    WriteMakefile(
      NAME =&gt; 'Foo',
      VERSION =&gt; $version,
      PM =&gt; { map { ($_ =&gt; &quot;\$(INST_LIB)/$_&quot;) } @pms },
      clean =&gt; { FILES =&gt; join ' ', @pms },
    );
    # common.pl:
    sub get_version { '0.04' }
    sub process { my $v = get_version(); s/__VERSION__/$v/g; }
    1;
    # Foo.pm.PL:
    require 'common.pl';
    $_ = join '', &lt;DATA&gt;;
    process();
    my $file = shift;
    open my $fh, '&gt;', $file or die &quot;$file: $!&quot;;
    print $fh $_;
    __DATA__
    package Foo;
    our $VERSION = '__VERSION__';
    1;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You may notice that
        <span class="Li">&quot;PL_FILES&quot;</span> is not specified above,
        since the default of mapping each .PL file to its basename works
      well.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the generated module were architecture-specific, you could
        replace <span class="Li">&quot;$(INST_LIB)&quot;</span> above with
        <span class="Li">&quot;$(INST_ARCHLIB)&quot;</span>, although if you
        locate modules under <i>lib</i>, that would involve ensuring any
        <span class="Li">&quot;lib/&quot;</span> in front of the module location
        were removed.</p>

  <dt>&quot;No rule to make target `/usr/lib/perl5/CORE/config.h', needed by

  <dd>Just what it says, you're missing that file. MakeMaker uses it to
      determine if perl has been rebuilt since the Makefile was made. It's a bit
      of a bug that it halts installation.
    <p class="Pp">Some operating systems don't ship the CORE directory with
        their base perl install. To solve the problem, you likely need to

  <dd>Why did MakeMaker reinvent the build configuration wheel? Why not just use
      autoconf or automake or ppm or Ant or ...
    <p class="Pp">There are many reasons, but the major one is cross-platform
        compatibility.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl is one of the most ported pieces of software ever. It
        works on operating systems I've never even heard of (see perlport for
        details). It needs a build tool that can work on all those platforms and
        with any wacky C compilers and linkers they might have.</p>
    <p class="Pp">No such build tool exists. Even make itself has wildly
        different dialects. So we have to build our own.</p>

  <dt id="What"><a class="permalink" href="#What">What is Module::Build and how

  <dd>Module::Build is a project by Ken Williams to supplant MakeMaker. Its

</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>pure perl. no make, no shell commands</li>
  <li>easier to customize</li>
  <li>cleaner internals</li>
  <li>less cruft</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Module::Build was long the official heir apparent to MakeMaker.
    The rate of both its development and adoption has slowed in recent years,
    though, and it is unclear what the future holds for it. That said,
    Module::Build set the stage for <i>something</i> to become the heir to
    MakeMaker. MakeMaker's maintainers have long said that it is a dead end and
    should be kept functioning, while being cautious about extending with new
    features.</p>

  <dt id="How~6"><a class="permalink" href="#How~6">How do I keep my $VERSION up
    to date without resetting it manually?</a></dt>
  <dd>Often you want to manually set the <span class="Li">$VERSION</span> in the
      main module distribution because this is the version that everybody sees
      on CPAN and maybe you want to customize it a bit. But for all the other
      modules in your dist, <span class="Li">$VERSION</span> is really just
      bookkeeping and all that's important is it goes up every time the module
      is changed. Doing this by hand is a pain and you often forget.
    <p class="Pp">Probably the easiest way to do this is using
        <i>perl-reversion</i> in Perl::Version:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  perl-reversion -bump
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If your version control system supports revision numbers (git
        doesn't easily), the simplest way to do it automatically is to use its
        revision number (you are using version control, right?).</p>
    <p class="Pp">In CVS, RCS and SVN you use <span class="Li">$Revision</span>$
        (see the documentation of your version control system for details).
        Every time the file is checked in the <span class="Li">$Revision</span>$
        will be updated, updating your <span class="Li">$VERSION</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">SVN uses a simple integer for
        <span class="Li">$Revision</span>$ so you can adapt it for your
        <span class="Li">$VERSION</span> like so:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    ($VERSION) = q$Revision$ =~ /(\d+)/;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In CVS and RCS version 1.9 is followed by 1.10. Since CPAN
        compares version numbers numerically we use a <b>sprintf()</b> to
        convert 1.9 to 1.009 and 1.10 to 1.010 which compare properly.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $VERSION = sprintf &quot;%d.%03d&quot;, q$Revision$ =~ /(\d+)\.(\d+)/g;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If branches are involved (ie.
        <span class="Li">$Revision:</span> 1.5.3.4$) it's a little more
        complicated.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # must be all on one line or MakeMaker will get confused.
    $VERSION = do { my @r = (q$Revision$ =~ /\d+/g); sprintf &quot;%d.&quot;.&quot;%03d&quot; x $#r, @r };
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In SVN, <span class="Li">$Revision</span>$ should be the same
        for every file in the project so they would all have the same
        <span class="Li">$VERSION</span>. CVS and RCS have a different
        <span class="Li">$Revision</span>$ per file so each file will have a
        different <span class="Li">$VERSION</span>. Distributed version control
        systems, such as SVK, may have a different
        <span class="Li">$Revision</span>$ based on who checks out the file,
        leading to a different <span class="Li">$VERSION</span> on each machine!
        Finally, some distributed version control systems, such as darcs, have
        no concept of revision number at all.</p>

  <dt id="What's"><a class="permalink" href="#What's">What's this
    <i>META.yml</i> thing and how did it get in my <i>MANIFEST</i>?!</a></dt>
  <dd><i>META.yml</i> is a module meta-data file pioneered by Module::Build and
      automatically generated as part of the 'distdir' target (and thus 'dist').
      See &quot;Module Meta-Data&quot; in ExtUtils::MakeMaker.
    <p class="Pp">To shut off its generation, pass the

  <dt id="How~7"><a class="permalink" href="#How~7">How do I delete everything
    not in my <i>MANIFEST</i>?</a></dt>
  <dd>Some folks are surprised that <span class="Li">&quot;make
      distclean&quot;</span> does not delete everything not listed in their
      MANIFEST (thus making a clean distribution) but only tells them what they
      need to delete. This is done because it is considered too dangerous. While
      developing your module you might write a new file, not add it to the
      MANIFEST, then run a <span class="Li">&quot;distclean&quot;</span> and be
      sad because your new work was deleted.
    <p class="Pp">If you really want to do this, you can use
        <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::Manifest::manifind()&quot;</span> to
        read the MANIFEST and File::Find to delete the files. But you have to be

      VERSION_FROM      =&gt; 'Foo.pm',

    <p class="Pp">Notice the <span class="Li">&quot;OBJECT&quot;</span>
        attribute. MakeMaker generates the following variables in
        <i>Makefile</i>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  # Handy lists of source code files:
  XS_FILES= Bar.xs \
        Foo.xs
  C_FILES = Bar.c \
        Foo.c
  O_FILES = Bar.o \
        Foo.o
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Therefore we can use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;O_FILES&quot;</span> variable to tell MakeMaker
        to use these objects into the shared library.</p>
    <p class="Pp">That's pretty much it. Now write <i>Foo.pm</i> and
        <i>Foo.xs</i>, <i>Bar.pm</i> and <i>Bar.xs</i>, where <i>Foo.pm</i>
        bootstraps the shared library and <i>Bar.pm</i> simply loading
        <i>Foo.pm</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The only issue left is to how to bootstrap <i>Bar.xs</i>. This
        is done from <i>Foo.xs</i>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  MODULE = Cool::Foo PACKAGE = Cool::Foo
  BOOT:
  # boot the second XS file
  boot_Cool__Bar(aTHX_ cv);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you have more than two files, this is the place where you
        should boot extra XS files from.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The following four files sum up all the details discussed so
        far.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  Foo.pm:
  -------
  package Cool::Foo;
  require DynaLoader;
  our @ISA = qw(DynaLoader);
  our $VERSION = '0.01';
  bootstrap Cool::Foo $VERSION;
  1;
  Bar.pm:
  -------
  package Cool::Bar;
  use Cool::Foo; # bootstraps Bar.xs
  1;
  Foo.xs:
  -------
  #include &quot;EXTERN.h&quot;
  #include &quot;perl.h&quot;
  #include &quot;XSUB.h&quot;
  MODULE = Cool::Foo  PACKAGE = Cool::Foo
  BOOT:
  # boot the second XS file
  boot_Cool__Bar(aTHX_ cv);
  MODULE = Cool::Foo  PACKAGE = Cool::Foo  PREFIX = cool_foo_
  void
  cool_foo_perl_rules()
      CODE:
      fprintf(stderr, &quot;Cool::Foo says: Perl Rules\n&quot;);
  Bar.xs:
  -------
  #include &quot;EXTERN.h&quot;
  #include &quot;perl.h&quot;
  #include &quot;XSUB.h&quot;
  MODULE = Cool::Bar  PACKAGE = Cool::Bar PREFIX = cool_bar_
  void
  cool_bar_perl_rules()
      CODE:
      fprintf(stderr, &quot;Cool::Bar says: Perl Rules\n&quot;);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">And of course a very basic test:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  t/cool.t:
  --------
  use Test;
  BEGIN { plan tests =&gt; 1 };
  use Cool::Foo;
  use Cool::Bar;
  Cool::Foo::perl_rules();
  Cool::Bar::perl_rules();
  ok 1;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This tip has been brought to you by Nick Ing-Simmons and Stas
        Bekman.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An alternative way to achieve this can be seen in
        Gtk2::CodeGen and Glib::CodeGen.</p>

<p class="Pp">NOTE: Yes, this is a mess. See
    &lt;http://archive.develooper.com/makemaker@perl.org/msg00134.html&gt; for
    some history.</p>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: When ExtUtils::MM is loaded it chooses a superclass for MM
    from amongst the ExtUtils::MM_* modules based on the current operating
    system.</p>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: ExtUtils::MM_{Current OS} represents one of the
    ExtUtils::MM_* modules except ExtUtils::MM_Any chosen based on your
    operating system.</p>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: The main object used by MakeMaker is a PACK### object, *not*
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker. It is, effectively, a subclass of MY,
    ExtUtils::MakeMaker, ExtUtils::Liblist and ExtUtils::MM_{Current OS}</p>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: The methods in MY are simply copied into PACK### rather than
    MY being a superclass of PACK###. I don't remember the rationale.</p>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: ExtUtils::Liblist should be removed from the inheritance
    hiearchy and simply be called as functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: Modules like File::Spec and Exporter have been omitted for
    clarity.</p>

<p class="Pp">NOTE: Each direct MM_Unix subclass is also an MM_Any subclass.
    This is a temporary hack because MM_Unix overrides some MM_Any methods with
    Unix specific code. It allows the non-Unix modules to see the original
    MM_Any implementations.</p>
