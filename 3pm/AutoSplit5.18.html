<p class="Pp">This function will split up your program into files that the
    AutoLoader module can handle. It is used by both the standard perl libraries
    and by the MakeMaker utility, to automatically configure libraries for
    autoloading.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;autosplit&quot;</span> interface splits
    the specified file into a hierarchy rooted at the directory
    <span class="Li">$dir</span>. It creates directories as needed to reflect
    class hierarchy, and creates the file <i>autosplit.ix</i>. This file acts as
    both forward declaration of all package routines, and as timestamp for the
    last update of the hierarchy.</p>
<p class="Pp">The remaining three arguments to
    <span class="Li">&quot;autosplit&quot;</span> govern other options to the
    autosplitter.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$keep</dt>
  <dd>If the third argument, <i></i><i>$keep</i><i></i>, is false, then any
      pre-existing <span class="Li">&quot;*.al&quot;</span> files in the
      autoload directory are removed if they are no longer part of the module
      (obsoleted functions). <span class="Li">$keep</span> defaults to 0.</dd>
  <dt>$check</dt>
  <dd>The fourth argument, <i></i><i>$check</i><i></i>, instructs
      <span class="Li">&quot;autosplit&quot;</span> to check the module
      currently being split to ensure that it includes a
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> specification for the AutoLoader
      module, and skips the module if AutoLoader is not detected.
      <span class="Li">$check</span> defaults to 1.</dd>
  <dt>$modtime</dt>
  <dd>Lastly, the <i></i><i>$modtime</i><i></i> argument specifies that
      <span class="Li">&quot;autosplit&quot;</span> is to check the modification
      time of the module against that of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;autosplit.ix&quot;</span> file, and only split the
      module if it is newer. <span class="Li">$modtime</span> defaults to
    1.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Typical use of AutoSplit in the perl MakeMaker utility is via the
    command-line with:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
 perl -e 'use AutoSplit; autosplit($ARGV[0], $ARGV[1], 0, 1, 1)'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Defined as a Make macro, it is invoked with file and directory
    arguments; <span class="Li">&quot;autosplit&quot;</span> will split the
    specified file into the specified directory and delete obsolete
    <span class="Li">&quot;.al&quot;</span> files, after checking first that the
    module does use the AutoLoader, and ensuring that the module is not already
    currently split in its current form (the modtime test).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;autosplit_lib_modules&quot;</span> form
    is used in the building of perl. It takes as input a list of files (modules)
    that are assumed to reside in a directory <b>lib</b> relative to the current
    directory. Each file is sent to the autosplitter one at a time, to be split
    into the directory <b>lib/auto</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In both usages of the autosplitter, only subroutines defined
    following the perl <i>__END__</i> token are split out into separate files.
    Some routines may be placed prior to this marker to force their immediate
    loading and parsing.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Multiple_packages"><a class="permalink" href="#Multiple_packages">Multiple
  packages</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As of version 1.01 of the AutoSplit module it is possible to have
    multiple packages within a single file. Both of the following cases are
    supported:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   package NAME;
   __END__
   sub AAA { ... }
   package NAME::option1;
   sub BBB { ... }
   package NAME::option2;
   sub BBB { ... }

   package NAME;
   __END__
   sub AAA { ... }
   sub NAME::option1::BBB { ... }
   sub NAME::option2::BBB { ... }
</pre>
</section>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="permalink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;AutoSplit&quot;</span> will inform the user
    if it is necessary to create the top-level directory specified in the
    invocation. It is preferred that the script or installation process that
    invokes <span class="Li">&quot;AutoSplit&quot;</span> have created the full
    directory path ahead of time. This warning may indicate that the module is
    being split into an incorrect path.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;AutoSplit&quot;</span> will warn the user
    of all subroutines whose name causes potential file naming conflicts on
    machines with drastically limited (8 characters or less) file name length.
    Since the subroutine name is used as the file name, these warnings can aid
    in portability to such systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">Warnings are issued and the file skipped if
    <span class="Li">&quot;AutoSplit&quot;</span> cannot locate either the
    <i>__END__</i> marker or a &quot;package Name;&quot;-style
  specification.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;AutoSplit&quot;</span> will also emit
    general diagnostics for inability to create directories or files.</p>

    For those of you that choose to use the GNU General Public License,
    my interpretation of the GNU General Public License is that no Perl
    script falls under the terms of the GPL unless you explicitly put
    said script under the terms of the GPL yourself.  Furthermore, any
    object code linked with perl does not automatically fall under the
    terms of the GPL, provided such object code only adds definitions
    of subroutines and variables, and does not otherwise impair the
    resulting interpreter from executing any standard Perl script.  I
    consider linking in C subroutines in this manner to be the moral
    equivalent of defining subroutines in the Perl language itself.  You
    may sell such an object file as proprietary provided that you provide
    or offer to provide the Perl source, as specified by the GNU General
    Public License.  (This is merely an alternate way of specifying input
    to the program.)  You may also sell a binary produced by the dumping of
    a running Perl script that belongs to you, provided that you provide or
    offer to provide the Perl source as specified by the GPL.  (The
    fact that a Perl interpreter and your code are in the same binary file
    is, in this case, a form of mere aggregation.)  This is my interpretation
    of the GPL.  If you still have concerns or difficulties understanding
    my intent, feel free to contact me.  Of course, the Artistic License
    spells all this out for your protection, so you may prefer to use that.
