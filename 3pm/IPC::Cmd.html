<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;can_run&quot;</span> takes only one

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;run&quot;</span> takes 4 arguments:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="command"><a class="permalink" href="#command">command</a></dt>
  <dd>This is the command to execute. It may be either a string or an array
      reference. This is a required argument.

        and their limitations.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="verbose"><a class="permalink" href="#verbose">verbose</a></dt>
  <dd>This controls whether all output of a command should also be printed to
      STDOUT/STDERR or should only be trapped in buffers (NOTE: buffers require
      IPC::Run to be installed, or your system able to work with IPC::Open3).
    <p class="Pp">It will default to the global setting of
        <span class="Li">$IPC::Cmd::VERBOSE</span>, which by default is 0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="buffer"><a class="permalink" href="#buffer">buffer</a></dt>
  <dd>This will hold all the output of a command. It needs to be a reference to
      a scalar. Note that this will hold both the STDOUT and STDERR messages,
      and you have no way of telling which is which. If you require this
      distinction, run the <span class="Li">&quot;run&quot;</span> command in
      list context and inspect the individual buffers.
    <p class="Pp">Of course, this requires that the underlying call supports
        buffers. See the note on buffers above.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="timeout"><a class="permalink" href="#timeout">timeout</a></dt>
  <dd>Sets the maximum time the command is allowed to run before aborting, using

      the return value will be set to an object of the

  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;run&quot;</span> will return a simple
    <span class="Li">&quot;true&quot;</span> or

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="success"><a class="permalink" href="#success">success</a></dt>
  <dd>A simple boolean indicating if the command executed without errors or

  <dt id="error"><a class="permalink" href="#error">error message</a></dt>
  <dd>If the first element of the return value
      (<span class="Li">&quot;success&quot;</span>) was 0, then some error
      occurred. This second element is the error message the command you
      requested exited with, if available. This is generally a pretty printed
      value of <span class="Li">$?</span> or <span class="Li">$@</span>. See
      <span class="Li">&quot;perldoc perlvar&quot;</span> for details on what

      timeout class.</dd>
  <dt id="full_buffer"><a class="permalink" href="#full_buffer">full_buffer</a></dt>

  <dt id="out_buffer"><a class="permalink" href="#out_buffer">out_buffer</a></dt>

  = run_forked( COMMAND, { child_stdin =&gt; SCALAR, timeout =&gt; DIGIT,
  stdout_handler =&gt; CODEREF, stderr_handler =&gt; CODEREF} );</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;run_forked&quot;</span> is used to execute
    some program or a coderef, optionally feed it with some input, get its
    return code and output (both stdout and stderr into separate buffers). In
    addition, it allows to terminate the program if it takes too long to
  finish.</p>
<p class="Pp">The important and distinguishing feature of run_forked is
    execution timeout which at first seems to be quite a simple task but if you
    think that the program which you're spawning might spawn some children
    itself (which in their turn could do the same and so on) it turns out to be
    not a simple issue.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;run_forked&quot;</span> is designed to
    survive and successfully terminate almost any long running task, even a fork
    bomb in case your system has the resources to survive during given
  timeout.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is achieved by creating separate watchdog process which
    spawns the specified program in a separate process session and supervises
    it: optionally feeds it with input, stores its exit code, stdout and stderr,
    terminates it in case it runs longer than specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">Invocation requires the command to be executed or a coderef and
    optionally a hashref of options:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;timeout&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Specify in seconds how long to run the command before it is killed with
      SIG_KILL (9), which effectively terminates it and all of its children
      (direct or indirect).</dd>
  <dt>&quot;child_stdin&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Specify some text that will be passed into the
      <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span> of the executed program.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;stdout_handler&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Coderef of a subroutine to call when a portion of data is received on
      STDOUT from the executing program.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;stderr_handler&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Coderef of a subroutine to call when a portion of data is received on
      STDERR from the executing program.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;wait_loop_callback&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Coderef of a subroutine to call inside of the main waiting loop (while
      <span class="Li">&quot;run_forked&quot;</span> waits for the external to
      finish or fail). It is useful to stop running external process before it
      ends by itself, e.g.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  my $r = run_forked(&quot;some external command&quot;, {
          'wait_loop_callback' =&gt; sub {
          if (condition) {
              kill(1, $$);
          }
          },
          'terminate_on_signal' =&gt; 'HUP',
          });
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Combined with
        <span class="Li">&quot;stdout_handler&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;stderr_handler&quot;</span> allows terminating
        external command based on its output. Could also be used as a timer
        without engaging with alarm (signals).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Remember that this code could be called every millisecond
        (depending on the output which external command generates), so try to
        make it as lightweight as possible.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;discard_output&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Discards the buffering of the standard output and standard errors for
      return by <b>run_forked()</b>. With this option you have to use the
      std*_handlers to read what the command outputs. Useful for commands that
      send a lot of output.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;terminate_on_parent_sudden_death&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Enable this option if you wish all spawned processes to be killed if the
      initially spawned process (the parent) is killed or dies without waiting
      for child processes.</dd>

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;run_forked&quot;</span> will return a

  <dd>When using <span class="Li">&quot;IPC::Open3&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span>, if you provide a string as the
      <span class="Li">&quot;command&quot;</span> argument, it is assumed to be
      appropriately escaped. You can use the
      <span class="Li">&quot;QUOTE&quot;</span> constant to use as a portable
      quote character (see above). However, if you provide an array reference,
      special rules apply:
    <p class="Pp">If your command contains <b>special characters</b> (&lt; &gt;
        | &amp;), it will be internally stringified before executing the
        command, to avoid that these special characters are escaped and passed
        as arguments instead of retaining their special meaning.</p>
    <p class="Pp">However, if the command contained arguments that contained
        whitespace, stringifying the command would lose the significance of the
        whitespace. Therefore, <span class="Li">&quot;IPC::Cmd&quot;</span> will
        quote any arguments containing whitespace in your command if the command
        is passed as an arrayref and contains special characters.</p>

  <dd>When using <span class="Li">&quot;IPC::Run&quot;</span>, if you provide a
      string as the <span class="Li">&quot;command&quot;</span> argument, the
      string will be split on whitespace to determine the individual elements of
      your command. Although this will usually just Do What You Mean, it may
      break if you have files or commands with whitespace in them.
    <p class="Pp">If you do not wish this to happen, you should provide an array
        reference, where all parts of your command are already separated out.
        Note however, if there are extra or spurious whitespaces in these parts,
        the parser or underlying code may not interpret it correctly, and cause

  <dd>Currently it is too complicated to parse your command for IO redirections.
