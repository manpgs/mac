<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;Sub::Util&quot;</span> contains a selection
    of utility subroutines that are useful for operating on subs and CODE
    references.</p>
<p class="Pp">The rationale for inclusion in this module is that the function
    performs some work for which an XS implementation is essential because it
    cannot be implemented in Pure Perl, and which is sufficiently-widely used
    across CPAN that its popularity warrants inclusion in a core module, which
    this is.</p>

<pre>
    my $proto = prototype( $code )
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Since version 1.40.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the prototype of the given <span class="Li">$code</span>
    reference, if it has one, as a string. This is the same as the
    <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::prototype&quot;</span> operator; it is included
    here simply for symmetry and completeness with the other functions.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="set_prototype"><a class="permalink" href="#set_prototype">set_prototype</a></h2>
<pre>
    my $code = set_prototype $prototype, $code;
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Since version 1.40.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Sets the prototype of the function given by the
    <span class="Li">$code</span> reference, or deletes it if
    <span class="Li">$prototype</span> is
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>. Returns the
    <span class="Li">$code</span> reference itself.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Caution</i>: This function takes arguments in a different order
    to the previous copy of the code from
    <span class="Li">&quot;Scalar::Util&quot;</span>. This is to match the order
    of <span class="Li">&quot;set_subname&quot;</span>, and other potential
    additions in this file. This order has been chosen as it allows a neat and
    simple chaining of other
    <span class="Li">&quot;Sub::Util::set_*&quot;</span> functions as might
    become available, such as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
 my $code =
    set_subname   name_here =&gt;
    set_prototype '&amp;@'      =&gt;
    set_attribute ':lvalue' =&gt;
       sub { ...... };
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="subname"><a class="permalink" href="#subname">subname</a></h2>
<pre>
    my $name = subname( $code )
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Since version 1.40.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the name of the given <span class="Li">$code</span>
    reference, if it has one. Normal named subs will give a fully-qualified name
    consisting of the package and the localname separated by
    <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span>. Anonymous code references will give
    <span class="Li">&quot;__ANON__&quot;</span> as the localname. If a name has
    been set using &quot;set_subname&quot;, this name will be returned
  instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">This function was inspired by
    <span class="Li">&quot;sub_fullname&quot;</span> from Sub::Identify. The
    remaining functions that <span class="Li">&quot;Sub::Identify&quot;</span>
    implements can easily be emulated using regexp operations, such as</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
 sub get_code_info { return (subname $_[0]) =~ m/^(.+)::(.*?)$/ }
 sub sub_name      { return (get_code_info $_[0])[0] }
 sub stash_name    { return (get_code_info $_[0])[1] }
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Users of Sub::Name beware</i>: This function is <b>not</b> the
    same as <span class="Li">&quot;Sub::Name::subname&quot;</span>; it returns
    the existing name of the sub rather than changing it. To set or change a
    name, see instead &quot;set_subname&quot;.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="set_subname"><a class="permalink" href="#set_subname">set_subname</a></h2>
<pre>
    my $code = set_subname $name, $code;
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Since version 1.40.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Sets the name of the function given by the
    <span class="Li">$code</span> reference. Returns the
    <span class="Li">$code</span> reference itself. If the
    <span class="Li">$name</span> is unqualified, the package of the caller is
    used to qualify it.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is useful for applying names to anonymous CODE references so
    that stack traces and similar situations, to give a useful name rather than
    having the default of <span class="Li">&quot;__ANON__&quot;</span>. Note
    that this name is only used for this situation; the
    <span class="Li">&quot;set_subname&quot;</span> will not install it into the
    symbol table; you will have to do that yourself if required.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, since the name is not used by perl except as the return
    value of <span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span>, for stack traces or
    similar, there is no actual requirement that the name be syntactically valid
    as a perl function name. This could be used to attach extra information that
    could be useful in debugging stack traces.</p>
<p class="Pp">This function was copied from
    <span class="Li">&quot;Sub::Name::subname&quot;</span> and renamed to the
    naming convention of this module.</p>
