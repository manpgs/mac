<p class="Pp">A good style of Perl programming calls for a lot of diverse
    regression tests.</p>
<p class="Pp">This module provides a few convenience methods for testing warning
    based code.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are not already familiar with the Test::More manpage now
    would be the time to go take a look.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">FUNCTIONS</h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="warning_is"><a class="permalink" href="#warning_is">warning_is BLOCK
    STRING, TEST_NAME</a></dt>
  <dd>Tests that BLOCK gives the specified warning exactly once. The test fails
      if the BLOCK warns more than once or does not warn at all. If the string
      is undef, then the tests succeeds if the BLOCK doesn't give any warning.
      Another way to say that there are no warnings in the block is
      <span class="Li">&quot;warnings_are {foo()} [], &quot;no
      warnings&quot;&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">If you want to test for a warning given by Carp, you have to
        write something like: <span class="Li">&quot;warning_is {carp
        &quot;msg&quot;} {carped =&gt; 'msg'}, &quot;Test for a carped
        warning&quot;&quot;</span>. The test will fail if a &quot;normal&quot;
        warning is found instead of a &quot;carped&quot; one.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note: <span class="Li">&quot;warn &quot;foo&quot;&quot;</span>
        would print something like <span class="Li">&quot;foo at -e line
        1&quot;</span>. This method ignores everything after the &quot;at&quot;.
        Thus to match this warning you would have to call
        <span class="Li">&quot;warning_is {warn &quot;foo&quot;}
        &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;Foo succeeded&quot;&quot;</span>. If you need to
        test for a warning at an exactly line, try something like
        <span class="Li">&quot;warning_like {warn &quot;foo&quot;} qr/at XYZ.dat
        line 5/&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">warning_is and warning_are are only aliases to the same
        method. So you also could write <span class="Li">&quot;warning_is
        {foo()} [], &quot;no warning&quot;&quot;</span> or something similar. I
        decided to give two methods the same name to improve readability.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A true value is returned if the test succeeds, false
        otherwise.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The test name is optional, but recommended.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="warnings_are"><a class="permalink" href="#warnings_are">warnings_are
    BLOCK ARRAYREF, TEST_NAME</a></dt>
  <dd>Tests to see that BLOCK gives exactly the specified warnings. The test
      fails if the warnings from BLOCK are not exactly the ones in ARRAYREF. If
      the ARRAYREF is equal to [], then the test succeeds if the BLOCK doesn't
      give any warning.
    <p class="Pp">Please read also the notes to warning_is as these methods are
        only aliases.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you want more than one test for carped warnings, try this:
        <span class="Li">&quot;warnings_are {carp &quot;c1&quot;; carp
        &quot;c2&quot;} {carped =&quot;</span> ['c1','c2'];&gt; or
        <span class="Li">&quot;warnings_are {foo()} [&quot;Warning 1&quot;,
        {carped =&quot;</span> [&quot;Carp 1&quot;, &quot;Carp 2&quot;]},
        &quot;Warning 2&quot;]&gt;. Note that <span class="Li">&quot;{carped
        =&quot;</span> ...}&gt; must always be a hash ref.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="warning_like"><a class="permalink" href="#warning_like">warning_like
    BLOCK REGEXP, TEST_NAME</a></dt>
  <dd>Tests that BLOCK gives exactly one warning and it can be matched by the
      given regexp. If the string is undef, then the tests succeeds if the BLOCK
      doesn't give any warning.
    <p class="Pp">The REGEXP is matched against the whole warning line, which in
        general has the form &quot;WARNING at __FILE__ line __LINE__&quot;. So
        you can check for a warning in the file Foo.pm on line 5 with
        <span class="Li">&quot;warning_like {bar()} qr/at Foo.pm line 5/,
        &quot;Testname&quot;&quot;</span>. I don't know whether it's sensful to
        do such a test :-( However, you should be prepared as a matching with
        'at', 'file', '\d' or similar will always pass. Think to the qr/^foo/ if
        you want to test for warning &quot;foo something&quot; in file
      foo.pl.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can also write the regexp in a string as &quot;/.../&quot;
        instead of using the qr/.../ syntax. Note that the slashes are important
        in the string, as strings without slashes are reserved for warning
        categories (to match warning categories as can be seen in the
        perllexwarn man page).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Similar to <span class="Li">&quot;warning_is&quot;</span>, you
        can test for warnings via <span class="Li">&quot;carp&quot;</span> with:
        <span class="Li">&quot;warning_like {bar()} {carped =&quot;</span>
        qr/bar called too early/i};&gt;</p>
    <p class="Pp">Similar to
        <span class="Li">&quot;warning_is&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;warnings_are&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;warning_like&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;warnings_like&quot;</span> are only aliases to
        the same methods.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A true value is returned if the test succeeds, false
        otherwise.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The test name is optional, but recommended.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="warning_like~2"><a class="permalink" href="#warning_like~2">warning_like
    BLOCK STRING, TEST_NAME</a></dt>
  <dd>Tests whether a BLOCK gives exactly one warning of the passed category.
      The categories are grouped in a tree, like it is expressed in perllexwarn.
      Note, that they have the hierarchical structure from perl 5.8.0, wich has
      a little bit changed to 5.6.1 or earlier versions (You can access the
      internal used tree with
      <span class="Li">$Test::Warn::Categorization::tree</span>, although I
      wouldn't recommend it)
    <p class="Pp">Thanks to the grouping in a tree, it's simple possible to test
        for an 'io' warning, instead for testing for a
        'closed|exec|layer|newline|pipe|unopened' warning.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note, that warnings occuring at compile time, can only be
        catched in an eval block. So</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  warning_like {eval q/&quot;$x&quot;; $x;/} 
               [qw/void uninitialized/], 
               &quot;some warnings at compile time&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will work, while it wouldn't work without the eval.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note, that it isn't possible yet, to test for own categories,
        created with warnings::register.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="warnings_like"><a class="permalink" href="#warnings_like">warnings_like
    BLOCK ARRAYREF, TEST_NAME</a></dt>
  <dd>Tests to see that BLOCK gives exactly the number of the specified warnings
      and all the warnings have to match in the defined order to the passed
      regexes.
    <p class="Pp">Please read also the notes to warning_like as these methods
        are only aliases.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Similar to <span class="Li">&quot;warnings_are&quot;</span>,
        you can test for multiple warnings via
        <span class="Li">&quot;carp&quot;</span> and for warning categories,
        too:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  warnings_like {foo()} 
                [qr/bar warning/,
                 qr/bar warning/,
                 {carped =&gt; qr/bar warning/i},
                 'io'
                ],
                &quot;I hope, you'll never have to write a test for so many warnings :-)&quot;;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="warnings_exist"><a class="permalink" href="#warnings_exist">warnings_exist
    BLOCK STRING|ARRAYREF, TEST_NAME</a></dt>
  <dd>Same as warning_like, but will <i>warn()</i> all warnings that do not
      match the supplied regex/category, instead of registering an error. Use
      this test when you just want to make sure that specific warnings were
      generated, and couldn't care less if other warnings happened in the same
      block of code.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  warnings_exist {...} [qr/expected warning/], &quot;Expected warning is thrown&quot;;

  warnings_exist {...} ['uninitialized'], &quot;Expected warning is thrown&quot;;

<p class="Pp">Please note that warnings with newlines inside are making a lot of
    trouble. The only sensible way to handle them is to use are the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warning_like&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings_like&quot;</span> methods. Background for
    these problems is that there is no really secure way to distinguish between
    warnings with newlines and a tracing stacktrace.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a method has it's own warn handler, overwriting
    <span class="Li">$SIG{__WARN__}</span>, my test warning methods won't get
    these warnings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;warning_like BLOCK CATEGORY,
    TEST_NAME&quot;</span> method isn't extremely tested. Please use this
    calling style with higher attention and tell me if you find a bug.</p>
