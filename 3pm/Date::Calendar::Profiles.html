<p class="Pp">This module provides some sample profiles (i.e., holiday schemes)
    for use with the <b>Date::Calendar</b>(3) and <b>Date::Calendar::Year</b>(3)
    module.</p>
<p class="Pp">You are not required to use these, you can always roll your own
    (this is very easy). See the section &quot;HOW TO ROLL YOUR OWN&quot; below
    for more instructions on how to do this, and take the profiles from this
    module as examples.</p>
<p class="Pp">I intend not to make any fixes to any of the calendar profiles in
    this module anymore unless there are VERY compelling reasons to do so. These
    profiles are merely meant as examples.</p>
<p class="Pp">The suggested way of using these profiles is to copy them to your
    own code and then to modify them as needed. Otherwise many people could be
    negatively affected if I made any changes to a profile someone has been
    using for years.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any improvements are therefore left as an exercise to the inclined
    reader.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The method &quot;<b>init()</b>&quot; in module
    <b>Date::Calendar::Year</b>(3) is responsible for parsing the calendar
    schemes contained here in the Date::Calendar::Profiles module.</p>
<p class="Pp">This method offers a &quot;mini-language&quot; which allows to
    specify common date formulas, like for instance a simple fixed date (in
    various different formats, e.g. american or european), or things like
    &quot;the second Sunday of May&quot; (Mother's Day), or &quot;Easter Sunday
    minus 46 days&quot; (Ash Wednesday), to cite just a few.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the section &quot;DATE FORMULA SYNTAX&quot; below for more
    details.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are some more complicated formulas, however, which cannot be
    expressed in such simple terms.</p>
<p class="Pp">The rule that if a holiday falls on a weekend, it will be
    substituted by either the adjacent Friday or Monday (whichever lies closer),
    is an example of this.</p>
<p class="Pp">In order to be able to deal with such formulas, and in order to be
    as flexible as possible, the &quot;<b>init()</b>&quot; method offers the
    possibility of using callback functions to deal with such dates and
    formulas.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the section &quot;CALLBACK INTERFACE&quot; below for more
    details on this topic.</p>
<p class="Pp">In order to assist you with more common cases of odd formulas, the
    module Date::Calendar::Profiles exports the following utility subroutines
    (which are meant to be used as &quot;filters&quot; in callback functions of
    your own):</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;($year,$month,$day[,ANYTHING]) =
      Previous_Friday($year,$month,$day[,ANYTHING]);&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">If the given date falls on a Saturday or Sunday, this function
        changes the date to the adjacent Friday before that, and returns this
        new date.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Otherwise the given date is returned unchanged.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The rest of the input parameters, if any, are simply copied to
        the output.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;($year,$month,$day[,ANYTHING]) =
      Next_Monday($year,$month,$day[,ANYTHING]);&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">If the given date falls on a Saturday or Sunday, this function
        changes the date to the adjacent Monday after that, and returns this new
        date.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Otherwise the given date is returned unchanged.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The rest of the input parameters, if any, are simply copied to
        the output.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;($year,$month,$day[,ANYTHING]) =
      Next_Monday_or_Tuesday($year,$month,$day[,ANYTHING]);&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">If the given date falls on a Saturday, the date of the next
        Monday (after that weekend) is returned.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the given date falls on a Sunday, the date of the next
        Tuesday (after that weekend) is returned.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the given date falls on a Monday, the date of the next
        Tuesday (the day after the Monday) is returned.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Otherwise the given date is returned unchanged.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The rest of the input parameters, if any, are simply copied to
        the output.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This function is used for the second of two adjacent holidays,
        where the first holiday obeys the &quot;Next Monday&quot; rule (see the
        description of the function immediately above).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Examples of this are Christmas and Boxing Day, among
      others.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When the first holiday falls on Friday, the second one falls
        on Saturday and is substituted by Monday.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When the first holiday falls on a Saturday, the second one
        falls on Sunday, so the first holiday is substituted by Monday and the
        second one by Tuesday.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When the first holiday falls on a Sunday, the second one falls
        on a Monday. Therefore the first holiday is substituted by Monday, and
        consequently the second holiday must be substituted by Tuesday.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Or, in other terms:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    Fri Sat =&gt; Fri Mon
    Sat Sun =&gt; Mon Tue
    Sun Mon =&gt; Mon Tue
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that there is no filter subroutine yet for the second of
        two adjacent holidays when the first holiday obeys the &quot;Nearest
        Workday&quot; rule (see the function described immediately below),
      i.e.,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    Fri Sat =&gt; Fri Mon
    Sat Sun =&gt; Fri Mon
    Sun Mon =&gt; Mon Tue
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This is left as an excercise to the inclined reader.
        <span class="Li">&quot;:-)&quot;</span></p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;($year,$month,$day[,ANYTHING]) =
      Nearest_Workday($year,$month,$day[,ANYTHING]);&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">If the given date falls on a Saturday, this function returns
        the date of the Friday on the day before.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the given date falls on a Sunday, this function returns the
        date of the Monday on the day after.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Otherwise the given date is returned unchanged.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The rest of the input parameters, if any, are simply copied to
        the output.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;($year,$month,$day[,ANYTHING]) =
      Sunday_to_Monday($year,$month,$day[,ANYTHING]);&quot;</span>
    <p class="Pp">If the given date falls on a Sunday, this function returns the
        date of the Monday on the day after.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Otherwise the given date is returned unchanged.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The rest of the input parameters, if any, are simply copied to
        the output.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The typical use of these filter subroutines is in a
    &quot;return&quot; statement at the end of callback functions of your own,
    when you already have calculated the holiday in question and only need to
    adjust it according to the rule implemented by the filter subroutine in
    question.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also the implementation of the Date::Calendar::Profiles module
    for examples of how to use these functions.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CALLBACK_INTERFACE"><a class="permalink" href="#CALLBACK_INTERFACE">CALLBACK
  INTERFACE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The interface of the callback functions to use with the
    &quot;<b>init()</b>&quot; method of the <b>Date::Calendar::Year</b>(3)
    module is very simple:</p>
<p class="Pp">The callback function receives two arguments when called, first
    the year number for which the holiday is to be calculated, and second the
    name (the &quot;label&quot;) of the holiday in question (which serves as key
    in the hash of a holiday scheme).</p>
<p class="Pp">This second parameter allows you to use the same callback function
    for different holidays, which might be more practical (than separate
    callback functions) if for instance you have a set of similar holidays to
    calculate, like for instance the four Sundays before Christmas
    (&quot;Advent&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">The callback function &quot;<b>Advent()</b>&quot; (exported by the
    Date::Calendar::Profiles module) exemplifies this technique.</p>
<p class="Pp">The callback function is expected to return a list
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;($year,$month,$day)&quot;</span>&quot; with the
    exact date of the holiday (the year number in the output must of course
    match the year number passed as parameter).</p>
<p class="Pp">A fatal error occurs if the returned list does not constitute a
    valid date, in the requested year.</p>
<p class="Pp">Optionally, the callback function may return a fourth value (after
    the date) containing a string, which may be either &quot;#&quot; or
    &quot;:&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The string &quot;#&quot; signifies that the date in question is a
    purely commemorative date, i.e., that you don't get a day off from work on
    that day.</p>
<p class="Pp">The string &quot;:&quot; means that the date in question is a
    &quot;half&quot; holiday, i.e., a day on which you get half a day off from
    work.</p>
<p class="Pp">In case the holiday in question was not observed or did not exist
    in the requested year, the callback function may also return an empty list.
    This will cause the &quot;<b>init()</b>&quot; method to simply drop this
    holiday for that year.</p>
<p class="Pp">The module Date::Calendar::Profiles exports the sample callback
    functions &quot;<b>Advent1()</b>&quot;, &quot;<b>Advent2()</b>&quot;,
    &quot;<b>Advent3()</b>&quot;, &quot;<b>Advent4()</b>&quot; and
    &quot;<b>Advent()</b>&quot;, which might assist you in rolling your own
    profiles.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="HOW_TO_ROLL_YOUR_OWN"><a class="permalink" href="#HOW_TO_ROLL_YOUR_OWN">HOW
  TO ROLL YOUR OWN</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Every calendar profile (holiday scheme) is a hash.</p>
<p class="Pp">The name of the holiday (like &quot;Christmas&quot;, for instance)
    serves as the key in this hash and must therefore be unique (unless you want
    to override a default which was set previously, but see below for more on
    this).</p>
<p class="Pp">The value for each key is either a string, which specifies a
    simple date formula, or the reference of a callback function.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the section &quot;CALLBACK INTERFACE&quot; above for a
    description of the interface (in and out) of these callback functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the section &quot;DATE FORMULA SYNTAX&quot; above and the
    description of the &quot;<b>init()</b>&quot; method in
    <b>Date::Calendar::Year</b>(3) for the exact syntax of date formula
  strings.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>BEWARE</b> that if keys are not unique in the source code,
    later entries will overwrite previous ones! I.e.,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    ...
    &quot;My special holiday&quot; =&gt; &quot;01-11&quot;,
    &quot;My special holiday&quot; =&gt; &quot;02-11&quot;,
    ...
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will <b>NOT</b> set two holidays of the same name, one on November
    first, the other on November second, but only one, on November second!</p>
<p class="Pp">Therefore, in order to use sets of defaults and to be able to
    override some of them, you must <b>FIRST</b> include any hash containing the
    default definitions, and <b>THEN</b> write down your own definitions (see
    also the Date::Calendar::Profiles module for examples of this!), like
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $defaults =
    {
        &quot;Holiday #1&quot; =&gt; &quot;01-01&quot;,
        &quot;Holiday #2&quot; =&gt; &quot;02-02&quot;,
        &quot;Holiday #3&quot; =&gt; &quot;03-03&quot;
    };

    $variant1 =
    {
        %$defaults,
        &quot;Holiday #2&quot; =&gt; &quot;09-02&quot;,
        &quot;Holiday #4&quot; =&gt; &quot;04-04&quot;
    };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is because of the way hashes work in Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now let's suppose that you want to write a profile containing all
    your relatives' and friends' birthdays or anniversaries.</p>
<p class="Pp">Simply go ahead and list them in your program, in any order you
    like, as follows (for example):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  $Birthdays =
  {
      &quot;Spouse 1971&quot;             =&gt;  &quot;30.12.&quot;,
      &quot;Wedding Day 1992&quot;        =&gt;  &quot;01.09.&quot;,
      &quot;Valentine's Day&quot;         =&gt;  &quot;14.02.&quot;,
      &quot;Son Richard 1996&quot;        =&gt;  &quot;11.05.&quot;,
      &quot;Daughter Irene 1994&quot;     =&gt;  &quot;17.01.&quot;,
      &quot;Mom 1939&quot;                =&gt;  &quot;19.08.&quot;,
      &quot;Dad 1937&quot;                =&gt;  &quot;23.04.&quot;,
      &quot;Brother Timothy 1969&quot;    =&gt;  &quot;24.04.&quot;,
      &quot;Sister Catherine 1973&quot;   =&gt;  &quot;21.10.&quot;,
      &quot;Cousin Paul 1970&quot;        =&gt;  &quot;16.10.&quot;,
      &quot;Aunt Marjorie 1944&quot;      =&gt;  &quot;09.06.&quot;,

      &quot;Friend Alexander 1968&quot;   =&gt;  &quot;12.06.&quot;,
  };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The year numbers after the names are not really necessary, but
    they allow us to display the person's current age. If this year number is
    omitted, we simply don't display the age.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now in order to query this birthday database, we can use the
    following little program:</p>

<p class="Pp">The calendar profiles included in this module usually do not take
    historical irregularities into account (even though some do in order to show
    how this can be done), they only provide means for calculating
    <b>regularly</b> recurring events (<b>the profiles should therefore not
    be</b> <b>relied upon for historical faithfulness</b>).</p>

<p class="Pp">The australian calendar profiles are known to contain wrong dates.
    This is due to the fact that Australia decrees its holidays individually for
    each year, difficulting the calculation of the holidays by way of a formula.
    An effort to compare (and to correct) the current implementation with
    official documents (web pages) by the Australian authorities is under way.
    This hasn't been finished yet because it is very time-consuming.</p>
