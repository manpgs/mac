<p class="Pp">This utility takes a list of libraries in the form
    <span class="Li">&quot;-llib1 -llib2</span>
    <span class="Li">-llib3&quot;</span> and returns lines suitable for
    inclusion in an extension Makefile. Extra library paths may be included with
    the form <span class="Li">&quot;-L/another/path&quot;</span> this will
    affect the searches for all subsequent libraries.</p>
<p class="Pp">It returns an array of four or five scalar values: EXTRALIBS,
    BSLOADLIBS, LDLOADLIBS, LD_RUN_PATH, and, optionally, a reference to the
    array of the filenames of actual libraries. Some of these don't mean
    anything unless on Unix. See the details about those platform specifics
    below. The list of the filenames is returned only if
    <span class="Li">$need_names</span> argument is true.</p>
<p class="Pp">Dependent libraries can be linked in one of three ways:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>For static extensions
    <p class="Pp">by the ld command when the perl binary is linked with the
        extension library. See EXTRALIBS below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>For dynamic extensions at build/link time
    <p class="Pp">by the ld command when the shared object is built/linked. See
        LDLOADLIBS below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>For dynamic extensions at load time
    <p class="Pp">by the DynaLoader when the shared object is loaded. See
        BSLOADLIBS below.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">EXTRALIBS</h2>
<p class="Pp">List of libraries that need to be linked with when linking a perl
    binary which includes this extension. Only those libraries that actually
    exist are included. These are written to a file and used when linking
  perl.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">LDLOADLIBS and LD_RUN_PATH</h2>
<p class="Pp">List of those libraries which can or must be linked into the
    shared library when created using ld. These may be static or dynamic
    libraries. LD_RUN_PATH is a colon separated list of the directories in
    LDLOADLIBS. It is passed as an environment variable to the process that
    links the shared library.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">BSLOADLIBS</h2>
<p class="Pp">List of those libraries that are needed but can be linked in
    dynamically at run time on this platform. SunOS/Solaris does not need this
    because ld records the information (from LDLOADLIBS) into the object file.
    This list is used to create a .bs (bootstrap) file.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PORTABILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This module deals with a lot of system dependencies and has quite
    a few architecture specific <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span>s in the
    code.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">VMS implementation</h2>
<p class="Pp">The version of <i>ext()</i> which is executed under VMS differs
    from the Unix-OS/2 version in several respects:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Input library and path specifications are accepted with or without the
      <span class="Li">&quot;-l&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;-L&quot;</span> prefixes used by Unix linkers. If
      neither prefix is present, a token is considered a directory to search if
      it is in fact a directory, and a library to search for otherwise. Authors
      who wish their extensions to be portable to Unix or OS/2 should use the
      Unix prefixes, since the Unix-OS/2 version of <i>ext()</i> requires
    them.</li>
  <li>Wherever possible, shareable images are preferred to object libraries, and
      object libraries to plain object files. In accordance with VMS naming
      conventions, <i>ext()</i> looks for files named <i>lib</i>shr and
      <i>lib</i>rtl; it also looks for <i>lib</i>lib and lib<i>lib</i> to
      accommodate Unix conventions used in some ported software.</li>
  <li>For each library that is found, an appropriate directive for a linker
      options file is generated. The return values are space-separated strings
      of these directives, rather than elements used on the linker command
    line.</li>
  <li>LDLOADLIBS contains both the libraries found based on
      <span class="Li">$potential_libs</span> and the CRTLs, if any, specified
      in Config.pm. EXTRALIBS contains just those libraries found based on
      <span class="Li">$potential_libs</span>. BSLOADLIBS and LD_RUN_PATH are
      always empty.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">In addition, an attempt is made to recognize several common Unix
    library names, and filter them out or convert them to their VMS equivalents,
    as appropriate.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, the VMS version of <i>ext()</i> should properly handle
    input from extensions originally designed for a Unix or VMS environment. If
    you encounter problems, or discover cases where the search could be
    improved, please let us know.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Win32_implementation"><a class="permalink" href="#Win32_implementation">Win32
  implementation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The version of <i>ext()</i> which is executed under Win32 differs
    from the Unix-OS/2 version in several respects:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>If <span class="Li">$potential_libs</span> is empty, the return value will
      be empty. Otherwise, the libraries specified by
      <span class="Li">$Config{perllibs}</span> (see Config.pm) will be appended
      to the list of <span class="Li">$potential_libs</span>. The libraries will
      be searched for in the directories specified in
      <span class="Li">$potential_libs</span>,
      <span class="Li">$Config{libpth}</span>, and in
      <span class="Li">&quot;$Config{installarchlib}/CORE&quot;</span>. For each
      library that is found, a space-separated list of fully qualified library
      pathnames is generated.</li>
  <li>Input library and path specifications are accepted with or without the
      <span class="Li">&quot;-l&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;-L&quot;</span> prefixes used by Unix linkers.
    <p class="Pp">An entry of the form
        <span class="Li">&quot;-La:\foo&quot;</span> specifies the
        <span class="Li">&quot;a:\foo&quot;</span> directory to look for the
        libraries that follow.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An entry of the form <span class="Li">&quot;-lfoo&quot;</span>
        specifies the library <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span>, which may
        be spelled differently depending on what kind of compiler you are using.
        If you are using GCC, it gets translated to
        <span class="Li">&quot;libfoo.a&quot;</span>, but for other win32
        compilers, it becomes <span class="Li">&quot;foo.lib&quot;</span>. If no
        files are found by those translated names, one more attempt is made to
        find them using either <span class="Li">&quot;foo.a&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;libfoo.lib&quot;</span>, depending on whether GCC
        or some other win32 compiler is being used, respectively.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If neither the <span class="Li">&quot;-L&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;-l&quot;</span> prefix is present in an entry,
        the entry is considered a directory to search if it is in fact a
        directory, and a library to search for otherwise. The
        <span class="Li">$Config{lib_ext}</span> suffix will be appended to any
        entries that are not directories and don't already have the suffix.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the <span class="Li">&quot;-L&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-l&quot;</span> prefixes are <b>not required</b>,
        but authors who wish their extensions to be portable to Unix or OS/2
        should use the prefixes, since the Unix-OS/2 version of <i>ext()</i>
        requires them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Entries cannot be plain object files, as many Win32 compilers will not
      handle object files in the place of libraries.</li>
  <li>Entries in <span class="Li">$potential_libs</span> beginning with a colon
      and followed by alphanumeric characters are treated as flags. Unknown
      flags will be ignored.
    <p class="Pp">An entry that matches
        <span class="Li">&quot;/:nodefault/i&quot;</span> disables the appending
        of default libraries found in <span class="Li">$Config{perllibs}</span>
        (this should be only needed very rarely).</p>
    <p class="Pp">An entry that matches
        <span class="Li">&quot;/:nosearch/i&quot;</span> disables all searching
        for the libraries specified after it. Translation of
        <span class="Li">&quot;-Lfoo&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-lfoo&quot;</span> still happens as appropriate
        (depending on compiler being used, as reflected by
        <span class="Li">$Config{cc}</span>), but the entries are not verified
        to be valid files or directories.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An entry that matches
        <span class="Li">&quot;/:search/i&quot;</span> reenables searching for
        the libraries specified after it. You can put it at the end to enable
        searching for default libraries specified by
        <span class="Li">$Config{perllibs}</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The libraries specified may be a mixture of static libraries and import
      libraries (to link with DLLs). Since both kinds are used pretty
      transparently on the Win32 platform, we do not attempt to distinguish
      between them.</li>
  <li>LDLOADLIBS and EXTRALIBS are always identical under Win32, and BSLOADLIBS
      and LD_RUN_PATH are always empty (this may change in future).</li>
  <li>You must make sure that any paths and path components are properly
      surrounded with double-quotes if they contain spaces. For example,
      <span class="Li">$potential_libs</span> could be (literally):
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
        &quot;-Lc:\Program Files\vc\lib&quot; msvcrt.lib &quot;la test\foo bar.lib&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note how the first and last entries are protected by quotes in
        order to protect the spaces.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Since this module is most often used only indirectly from extension
      <span class="Li">&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</span> files, here is an example
      <span class="Li">&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</span> entry to add a library to
      the build process for an extension:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
        LIBS =&gt; ['-lgl']
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">When using GCC, that entry specifies that MakeMaker should
        first look for <span class="Li">&quot;libgl.a&quot;</span> (followed by
        <span class="Li">&quot;gl.a&quot;</span>) in all the locations specified
        by <span class="Li">$Config{libpth}</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When using a compiler other than GCC, the above entry will
        search for <span class="Li">&quot;gl.lib&quot;</span> (followed by
        <span class="Li">&quot;libgl.lib&quot;</span>).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the library happens to be in a location not in
        <span class="Li">$Config{libpth}</span>, you need:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
        LIBS =&gt; ['-Lc:\gllibs -lgl']
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Here is a less often used example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
        LIBS =&gt; ['-lgl', ':nosearch -Ld:\mesalibs -lmesa -luser32']
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This specifies a search for library
        <span class="Li">&quot;gl&quot;</span> as before. If that search fails
        to find the library, it looks at the next item in the list. The
        <span class="Li">&quot;:nosearch&quot;</span> flag will prevent
        searching for the libraries that follow, so it simply returns the value
        as <span class="Li">&quot;-Ld:\mesalibs -lmesa -luser32&quot;</span>,
        since GCC can use that value as is with its linker.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When using the Visual C compiler, the second item is returned
        as <span class="Li">&quot;-libpath:d:\mesalibs mesa.lib
        user32.lib&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When using the Borland compiler, the second item is returned
        as <span class="Li">&quot;-Ld:\mesalibs mesa.lib
        user32.lib&quot;</span>, and MakeMaker takes care of moving the
        <span class="Li">&quot;-Ld:\mesalibs&quot;</span> to the correct place
        in the linker command line.</p>
