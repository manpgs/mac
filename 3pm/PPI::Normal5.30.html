<p class="Pp">PPI::Normal - Normalize Perl Documents</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl Documents, as created by PPI, are typically filled with all
    sorts of mess such as whitespace and comments and other things that don't
    effect the actual meaning of the code.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, because there is more than one way to do most things,
    and the syntax of Perl itself is quite flexible, there are many ways in
    which the &quot;same&quot; code can look quite different.</p>
<p class="Pp">PPI::Normal attempts to resolve this by providing a variety of
    mechanisms and algorithms to &quot;normalize&quot; Perl Documents, and
    determine a sort of base form for them (although this base form will be a
    memory structure, and not something that can be turned back into Perl source
    code).</p>
<p class="Pp">The process itself is quite complex, and so for convenience and
    extensibility it has been separated into a number of layers. At a later
    point, it will be possible to write Plugin classes to insert additional
    normalization steps into the various different layers.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, you can choose to do the normalization only as deep
    as a particular layer, depending on aggressively you want the normalization
    process to be.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="register_$function_=__$layer,_..."><a class="permalink" href="#register_$function_=__$layer,_...">register
  $function =&gt; $layer, ...</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;register&quot;</span> method is used by
    normalization method providers to tell the normalization engines which
    functions need to be run, and in which layer they apply.</p>
<p class="Pp">Provide a set of key/value pairs, where the key is the full name
    of the function (in string form), and the value is the layer (see
    description of the layers above) in which it should be run.</p>
<p class="Pp">Returns true if all functions are registered, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> on error.</p>

<pre>
  my $level_1 = PPI::Normal-&gt;new;
  my $level_2 = PPI::Normal-&gt;new(2);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Creates a new normalization object, to which Document objects can
    be passed to be normalized.</p>
<p class="Pp">Of course, what you probably REALLY want is just to call
    PPI::Document's <span class="Li">&quot;normalize&quot;</span> method.</p>
<p class="Pp">Takes an optional single parameter of the normalisation layer to
    use, which at this time can be either &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Returns a new <span class="Li">&quot;PPI::Normal&quot;</span>
    object, or <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> on error.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="layer"><a class="permalink" href="#layer">layer</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;layer&quot;</span> accessor returns the
    normalisation layer of the object.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="process"><a class="permalink" href="#process">process</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;process&quot;</span> method takes
    anything that can be converted to a PPI::Document (object, SCALAR ref,
    filename), loads it and applies the normalisation process to the
  document.</p>
<p class="Pp">Returns a PPI::Document::Normalized object, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> on error.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The following normalisation layers are implemented. When writing
    plugins, you should register each transformation function with the
    appropriate layer.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Layer_1_"><a class="permalink" href="#Layer_1_">Layer 1 -
  Insignificant Data Removal</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The basic step common to all normalization, layer 1 scans through
    the Document and removes all whitespace, comments, POD, and anything else
    that returns false for its <span class="Li">&quot;significant&quot;</span>
    method.</p>
<p class="Pp">It also checks each Element and removes known-useless sub-element
    metadata such as the Element's physical position in the file.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Layer_2_"><a class="permalink" href="#Layer_2_">Layer 2 -
  Significant Element Removal</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">After the removal of the insignificant data, Layer 2 removed
    larger, more complex, and superficially &quot;significant&quot; elements,
    that can be removed for the purposes of normalisation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples from this layer include pragmas, now-useless statement
    separators (since the PDOM tree is holding statement elements), and several
    other minor bits and pieces.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Layer_3_"><a class="permalink" href="#Layer_3_">Layer 3 - TO
  BE COMPLETED</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This version of the forward-port of the Perl::Compare
    functionality to the 0.900+ API of PPI only implements Layer 1 and 2 at this
    time.</p>
