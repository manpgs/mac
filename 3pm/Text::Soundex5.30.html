<p class="Pp">Soundex is a phonetic algorithm for indexing names by sound, as
    pronounced in English. The goal is for names with the same pronunciation to
    be encoded to the same representation so that they can be matched despite
    minor differences in spelling. Soundex is the most widely known of all
    phonetic algorithms and is often used (incorrectly) as a synonym for
    &quot;phonetic algorithm&quot;. Improvements to Soundex are the basis for
    many modern phonetic algorithms. (Wikipedia, 2007)</p>
<p class="Pp">This module implements the original soundex algorithm developed by
    Robert Russell and Margaret Odell, patented in 1918 and 1922, as well as a
    variation called &quot;American Soundex&quot; used for US census data, and
    current maintained by the National Archives and Records Administration
    (NARA).</p>
<p class="Pp">The soundex algorithm may be recognized from Donald Knuth's <b>The
    Art of Computer Programming</b>. The algorithm described by Knuth is the
    NARA algorithm.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value returned for strings which have no soundex encoding is
    defined using <span class="Li">$Text::Soundex::nocode</span>. The default
    value is <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>, however values such as
    <span class="Li">'Z000'</span> are commonly used alternatives.</p>
<p class="Pp">For backward compatibility with older versions of this module the
    <span class="Li">$Text::Soundex::nocode</span> is exported into the caller's
    namespace as <span class="Li">$soundex_nocode</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In scalar context, <span class="Li">&quot;soundex()&quot;</span>
    returns the soundex code of its first argument. In list context, a list is
    returned in which each element is the soundex code for the corresponding
    argument passed to <span class="Li">&quot;soundex()&quot;</span>. For
    example, the following code assigns <span class="Li">@codes</span> the value
    <span class="Li">&quot;('M200', 'S320')&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   @codes = soundex qw(Mike Stok);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To use <span class="Li">&quot;Text::Soundex&quot;</span> to
    generate codes that can be used to search one of the publically available US
    Censuses, a variant of the soundex algorithm must be used:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Text::Soundex;
    $code = soundex_nara($name);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">An example of where these algorithm differ follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Text::Soundex;
    print soundex(&quot;Ashcraft&quot;), &quot;\n&quot;;       # prints: A226
    print soundex_nara(&quot;Ashcraft&quot;), &quot;\n&quot;;  # prints: A261
</pre>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Donald Knuth's examples of names and the soundex codes they map to
    are listed below:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  Euler, Ellery -&gt; E460
  Gauss, Ghosh -&gt; G200
  Hilbert, Heilbronn -&gt; H416
  Knuth, Kant -&gt; K530
  Lloyd, Ladd -&gt; L300
  Lukasiewicz, Lissajous -&gt; L222
</pre>
<p class="Pp">so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  $code = soundex 'Knuth';         # $code contains 'K530'
  @list = soundex qw(Lloyd Gauss); # @list contains 'L300', 'G200'
</pre>

<h1 class="Sh" id="LIMITATIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">As the soundex algorithm was originally used a <b>long</b> time
    ago in the US it considers only the English alphabet and pronunciation. In
    particular, non-ASCII characters will be ignored. The recommended method of
    dealing with characters that have accents, or other unicode characters, is
    to use the Text::Unidecode module available from CPAN. Either use the module
    explicitly:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Text::Soundex;
    use Text::Unidecode;

    print soundex(unidecode(&quot;Fran\xE7ais&quot;)), &quot;\n&quot;; # Prints &quot;F652\n&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or use the convenient wrapper routine:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Text::Soundex 'soundex_unicode';

    print soundex_unicode(&quot;Fran\xE7ais&quot;), &quot;\n&quot;;    # Prints &quot;F652\n&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Since the soundex algorithm maps a large space (strings of
    arbitrary length) onto a small space (single letter plus 3 digits) no
    inference can be made about the similarity of two strings which end up with
    the same soundex code. For example, both
    <span class="Li">&quot;Hilbert&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Heilbronn&quot;</span> end up with a soundex code of
    <span class="Li">&quot;H416&quot;</span>.</p>

<p class="Pp">Version 3 is a significant update to provide support for versions
    of Perl later than Perl 5.004. Specifically, the XS version of the
    <b>soundex()</b> subroutine understands strings that are encoded using UTF-8
    (unicode strings).</p>
<p class="Pp">Version 2 of this module was a re-write by Mark Mielke
    (<span class="Li">&quot;mark@mielke.cc&quot;</span>) to improve the speed of
    the subroutines. The XS version of the <b>soundex()</b> subroutine was
    introduced in 2.00.</p>
<p class="Pp">Version 1 of this module was written by Mike Stok
    (<span class="Li">&quot;mike@stok.co.uk&quot;</span>) and was included into
    the Perl core library set.</p>
<p class="Pp">Dave Carlsen
    (<span class="Li">&quot;dcarlsen@csranet.com&quot;</span>) made the request
    for the NARA algorithm to be included. The NARA soundex page can be viewed
    at:
    <span class="Li">&quot;http://www.archives.gov/research/census/soundex.html&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Pp">Ian Phillips (<span class="Li">&quot;ian@pipex.net&quot;</span>)
    and Rich Pinder (<span class="Li">&quot;rpinder@hsc.usc.edu&quot;</span>)
    supplied ideas and spotted mistakes for v1.x.</p>
