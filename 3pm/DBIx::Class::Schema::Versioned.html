<p class="Pp">This module provides methods to apply DDL changes to your database
    using SQL diff files. Normally these diff files would be created using
    &quot;create_ddl_dir&quot; in DBIx::Class::Schema.</p>
<p class="Pp">A table called <i>dbix_class_schema_versions</i> is created and
    maintained by the module. This is used to determine which version your
    database is currently at. Similarly the <span class="Li">$VERSION</span> in
    your DBIC schema class is used to determine the current DBIC schema
  version.</p>
<p class="Pp">The upgrade is initiated manually by calling
    <span class="Li">&quot;upgrade&quot;</span> on your schema object, this will
    attempt to upgrade the database from its current version to the current
    schema version using a diff from your <i>upgrade_directory</i>. If a
    suitable diff is not found then no upgrade is possible.</p>

<p class="Pp">DBIx::Class::DeploymentHandler is a much more powerful alternative
    to this module. Examples of things it can do that this module cannot do
    include</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Downgrades in addition to upgrades</li>
  <li>Multiple sql files per upgrade/downgrade/install</li>
  <li>Perl scripts allowed for upgrade/downgrade/install</li>
  <li>Just one set of files needed for upgrade, unlike this module where one
      might need to generate <span class="Li">&quot;factorial(scalar
      @versions)&quot;</span></li>
</ul>

<h1 class="Sh" id="GETTING_STARTED"><a class="permalink" href="#GETTING_STARTED">GETTING
  STARTED</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Firstly you need to setup your schema class as per the
    &quot;SYNOPSIS&quot;, make sure you have specified an upgrade_directory and
    an initial <span class="Li">$VERSION</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Then you'll need two scripts, one to create DDL files and diffs
    and another to perform upgrades. Your creation script might look like a bit
    like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use strict;
  use Pod::Usage;
  use Getopt::Long;
  use MyApp::Schema;
  my ( $preversion, $help );
  GetOptions(
    'p|preversion:s'  =&gt; \$preversion,
  ) or die pod2usage;
  my $schema = MyApp::Schema-&gt;connect(
    $dsn,
    $user,
    $password,
  );
  my $sql_dir = './sql';
  my $version = $schema-&gt;schema_version();
  $schema-&gt;create_ddl_dir( 'MySQL', $version, $sql_dir, $preversion );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Then your upgrade script might look like so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use strict;
  use MyApp::Schema;
  my $schema = MyApp::Schema-&gt;connect(
    $dsn,
    $user,
    $password,
  );
  if (!$schema-&gt;get_db_version()) {
    # schema is unversioned
    $schema-&gt;deploy();
  } else {
    $schema-&gt;upgrade();
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The script above assumes that if the database is unversioned then
    it is empty and we can safely deploy the DDL to it. However things are not
    always so simple.</p>
<p class="Pp">if you want to initialise a pre-existing database where the DDL is
    not the same as the DDL for your current schema version then you will need a
    diff which converts the database's DDL to the current DDL. The best way to
    do this is to get a dump of the database schema (without data) and save that
    in your SQL directory as version 0.000 (the filename must be as with
    &quot;ddl_filename&quot; in DBIx::Class::Schema) then create a diff using
    your create DDL script given above from version 0.000 to the current
    version. Then hand check and if necessary edit the resulting diff to ensure
    that it will apply. Once you have done all that you can do this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  if (!$schema-&gt;get_db_version()) {
    # schema is unversioned
    $schema-&gt;install(&quot;0.000&quot;);
  }
  # this will now apply the 0.000 to current version diff
  $schema-&gt;upgrade();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In the case of an unversioned database the above code will create
    the dbix_class_schema_versions table and write version 0.000 to it, then
    upgrade will then apply the diff we talked about creating in the previous
    paragraph and then you're good to go.</p>

<p class="Pp">Virtual method that should be overridden to create an upgrade
    file. This is useful in the case of upgrading across multiple versions to
    concatenate several files to create one upgrade file.</p>
<p class="Pp">You'll probably want the db_version retrieved via
    <span class="Li">$self</span>-&gt;get_db_version and the schema_version

<p class="Pp">Virtual method that should be overridden to return an ordered list
    of schema versions. This is then used to produce a set of steps to upgrade
    through to achieve the required schema version.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may want the db_version retrieved via

<p class="Pp">Call this to attempt to upgrade your database from the version it
    is at to the version this DBIC schema is at. If they are the same it does
    nothing.</p>
<p class="Pp">It will call &quot;ordered_schema_versions&quot; to retrieve an
    ordered list of schema versions (if ordered_schema_versions returns nothing
    then it is assumed you can do the upgrade as a single step). It then
    iterates through the list of versions between the current db version and the
    schema version applying one update at a time until all relevant updates are
    applied.</p>
<p class="Pp">The individual update steps are performed by using
    &quot;upgrade_single_step&quot;, which will apply the update and also update
    the dbix_class_schema_versions table.</p>

<p class="Pp">Call this to attempt to upgrade your database from the

<p class="Pp">It requires an SQL diff file to exist in your
    <i>upgrade_directory</i>, normally you will have created this using
    &quot;create_ddl_dir&quot; in DBIx::Class::Schema.</p>
<p class="Pp">If successful the dbix_class_schema_versions table is updated with
    the <i>target_version</i>.</p>

    upgrade through a series of updates.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="do_upgrade"><a class="permalink" href="#do_upgrade">do_upgrade</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This is an overwritable method used to run your upgrade. The
    freeform method allows you to run your upgrade any way you please, you can
    call <span class="Li">&quot;run_upgrade&quot;</span> any number of times to
    run the actual SQL commands, and in between you can sandwich your data
    upgrading. For example, first run all the <b>CREATE</b> commands, then
    migrate your data from old to new tables/formats, then issue the DROP
    commands when you are finished. Will run the whole file as it is by
  default.</p>
</section>

<h2 class="Ss" id="run_upgrade"><a class="permalink" href="#run_upgrade">run_upgrade</a></h2>
<pre> $self-&gt;run_upgrade(qr/create/i);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Runs a set of SQL statements matching a passed in regular
    expression. The idea is that this method can be called any number of times
    from your <span class="Li">&quot;do_upgrade&quot;</span> method, running
    whichever commands you specify via the regex in the parameter. Probably
    won't work unless called from the overridable do_upgrade method.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="apply_statement"><a class="permalink" href="#apply_statement">apply_statement</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Takes an SQL statement and runs it. Override this if you want to

</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="get_db_version"><a class="permalink" href="#get_db_version">get_db_version</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Returns the version that your database is currently at. This is

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="backup"><a class="permalink" href="#backup">backup</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This is an overwritable method which is called just before the
    upgrade, to allow you to make a backup of the database. Per default this
    method attempts to call
    <span class="Li">&quot;$self-&gt;storage-&gt;backup&quot;</span>, to run the
    standard backup on each database type.</p>
<p class="Pp">This method should return the name of the backup file, if
    appropriate..</p>
<p class="Pp">This method is disabled by default. Set
    <span class="Li">$schema</span>-&gt;<b>do_backup</b>(1) to enable it.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="connection"><a class="permalink" href="#connection">connection</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Overloaded method. This checks the DBIC schema version against the
    DB version and warns if they are not the same or if the DB is unversioned.
    It also provides compatibility between the old versions table
    (SchemaVersions) and the new one (dbix_class_schema_versions).</p>
<p class="Pp">To avoid the checks on connect, set the environment var
    DBIC_NO_VERSION_CHECK or alternatively you can set the ignore_version attr
    in the forth argument like so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my $schema = MyApp::Schema-&gt;connect(
    $dsn,
    $user,
