<p class="Pp">The intent of File::ShareDir is to provide a companion to
    Class::Inspector and File::HomeDir, modules that take a process that is
    well-known by advanced Perl developers but gets a little tricky, and make it
    more available to the larger Perl community.</p>
<p class="Pp">Quite often you want or need your Perl module (CPAN or otherwise)
    to have access to a large amount of read-only data that is stored on the
    file-system at run-time.</p>
<p class="Pp">On a linux-like system, this would be in a place such as
    /usr/share, however Perl runs on a wide variety of different systems, and so
    the use of any one location is unreliable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl provides a little-known method for doing this, but almost
    nobody is aware that it exists. As a result, module authors often go through
    some very strange ways to make the data available to their code.</p>
<p class="Pp">The most common of these is to dump the data out to an enormous
    Perl data structure and save it into the module itself. The result are
    enormous multi-megabyte .pm files that chew up a lot of memory
  needlessly.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another method is to put the data &quot;file&quot; after the
    __DATA__ compiler tag and limit yourself to access as a filehandle.</p>
<p class="Pp">The problem to solve is really quite simple.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  1. Write the data files to the system at install time.
  
  2. Know where you put them at run-time.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Perl's install system creates an &quot;auto&quot; directory for
    both every distribution and for every module file.</p>
<p class="Pp">These are used by a couple of different auto-loading systems to
    store code fragments generated at install time, and various other modules
    written by the Perl &quot;ancient masters&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">But the same mechanism is available to any dist or module to store
    any sort of data.</p>

  Data in your Module</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;File::ShareDir&quot;</span> forms one half
    of a two part solution.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once the files have been installed to the correct directory, you
    can use <span class="Li">&quot;File::ShareDir&quot;</span> to find your
    files again after the installation.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the installation half of the solution, see
    File::ShareDir::Install and its
    <span class="Li">&quot;install_share&quot;</span> directive.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using File::ShareDir::Install together with File::ShareDir allows
    one to rely on the files in appropriate
    <span class="Li">&quot;dist_dir()&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;module_dir()&quot;</span> in development phase,
  too.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="FUNCTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;File::ShareDir&quot;</span> provides four
    functions for locating files and directories.</p>
<p class="Pp">For greater maintainability, none of these are exported by default
    and you are expected to name the ones you want at use-time, or provide the
    <span class="Li">':ALL'</span> tag. All of the following are equivalent.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  # Load but don't import, and then call directly
  use File::ShareDir;
  $dir = File::ShareDir::dist_dir('My-Dist');
  
  # Import a single function
  use File::ShareDir 'dist_dir';
  dist_dir('My-Dist');
  
  # Import all the functions
  use File::ShareDir ':ALL';
  dist_dir('My-Dist');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">All of the functions will check for you that the dir/file actually
    exists, and that you have read permissions, or they will throw an
  exception.</p>

<pre>
  # Get a distribution's shared files directory

</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;dist_dir&quot;</span> function takes a
    single parameter of the name of an installed (CPAN or otherwise)
    distribution, and locates the shared data directory created at install time
    for it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Returns the directory path as a string, or dies if it cannot be

<p class="Pp">The filename should be a relative path in the format of your local
