<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Class::XSAccessor implements fast read, write and read/write
    accessors in XS. Additionally, it can provide predicates such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;has_foo()&quot;</span> for testing whether the
    attribute <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span> exists in the object
    (which is different from &quot;is defined within the object&quot;). It only
    works with objects that are implemented as ordinary hashes.
    Class::XSAccessor::Array implements the same interface for objects that use
    arrays for their internal representation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since version 0.10, the module can also generate simple
    constructors (implemented in XS). Simply supply the
    <span class="Li">&quot;constructor =&gt; 'constructor_name'&quot;</span>
    option or the <span class="Li">&quot;constructors =&gt; ['new', 'create',
    'spawn']&quot;</span> option. These constructors do the equivalent of the
    following Perl code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    return bless { @_ }, ref($class)||$class;
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That means they can be called on objects and classes but will not
    clone objects entirely. Parameters to
    <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span> are added to the object.</p>
<p class="Pp">The XS accessor methods are between 3 and 4 times faster than
    typical pure-Perl accessors in some simple benchmarking. The lower factor
    applies to the potentially slightly obscure <span class="Li">&quot;sub
    set_foo_pp {$_[0]-&gt;{foo} = $_[1]}&quot;</span>, so if you usually write
    clear code, a factor of 3.5 speed-up is a good estimate. If in doubt, do
    your own benchmarking!</p>
<p class="Pp">The method names may be fully qualified. The example in the
    synopsis could have been written as
    <span class="Li">&quot;MyClass::get_foo&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;get_foo&quot;</span>. This way, methods can be
    installed in classes other than the current class. See also: the
    <span class="Li">&quot;class&quot;</span> option below.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, the setters return the new value that was set, and the
    accessors (mutators) do the same. This behaviour can be changed with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;chained&quot;</span> option - see below. The
    predicates return a boolean.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since version 1.01,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Class::XSAccessor&quot;</span> can generate extremely
    simple methods which just return true or false (and always do so). If that
    seems like a really superfluous thing to you, then consider a large class
    hierarchy with interfaces such as PPI. These methods are provided by the
    <span class="Li">&quot;true&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;false&quot;</span> options - see the synopsis.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;defined_predicates&quot;</span> check
    whether a given object attribute is defined.
    <span class="Li">&quot;predicates&quot;</span> is an alias for
    <span class="Li">&quot;defined_predicates&quot;</span> for compatibility
    with older versions of
    <span class="Li">&quot;Class::XSAccessor&quot;</span>.
    <span class="Li">&quot;exists_predicates&quot;</span> checks whether the
    given attribute exists in the object using
    <span class="Li">&quot;exists&quot;</span>.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In addition to specifying the types and names of accessors,
    additional options can be supplied which modify behaviour. The options are
    specified as key/value pairs in the same manner as the accessor declaration.
    For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use Class::XSAccessor
    getters =&gt; {
      get_foo =&gt; 'foo',
    },
    replace =&gt; 1;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The list of available options is:</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="replace"><a class="permalink" href="#replace">replace</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Set this to a true value to prevent
    <span class="Li">&quot;Class::XSAccessor&quot;</span> from complaining about
    replacing existing subroutines.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="chained"><a class="permalink" href="#chained">chained</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Set this to a true value to change the return value of setters and
    mutators (when called with an argument). If
    <span class="Li">&quot;chained&quot;</span> is enabled, the setters and
    accessors/mutators will return the object. Mutators called without an
    argument still return the value of the associated attribute.</p>
<p class="Pp">As with the other options,
    <span class="Li">&quot;chained&quot;</span> affects all methods generated in
    the same <span class="Li">&quot;use Class::XSAccessor ...&quot;</span>
    statement.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="class"><a class="permalink" href="#class">class</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">By default, the accessors are generated in the calling class. The
    the <span class="Li">&quot;class&quot;</span> option allows the target class
    to be specified.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="LVALUES"><a class="permalink" href="#LVALUES">LVALUES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Support for lvalue accessors via the keyword
    <span class="Li">&quot;lvalue_accessors&quot;</span> was added in version
    1.08. At this point, <b>THEY ARE CONSIDERED HIGHLY</b> <b>EXPERIMENTAL</b>.
    Furthermore, their performance hasn't been benchmarked yet.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following example demonstrates an lvalue accessor:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  package Address;
  use Class::XSAccessor
    constructor =&gt; 'new',
    lvalue_accessors =&gt; { zip_code =&gt; 'zip' };
  
  package main;
  my $address = Address-&gt;new(zip =&gt; 2);
  print $address-&gt;zip_code, &quot;\n&quot;; # prints 2
  $address-&gt;zip_code = 76135; # &lt;--- This is it!
  print $address-&gt;zip_code, &quot;\n&quot;; # prints 76135
</pre>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="permalink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Probably won't work for objects based on <i>tied</i> hashes. But
    that's a strange thing to do anyway.</p>
<p class="Pp">Scary code exploiting strange XS features.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you think writing an accessor in XS should be a laughably
    simple exercise, then please contemplate how you could instantiate a new XS
    accessor for a new hash key that's only known at run-time. Note that
    compiling C code at run-time a la Inline::C is a no go.</p>
<p class="Pp">Threading. With version 1.00, a memory leak has been <b>fixed</b>.
    Previously, a small amount of memory would leak if
    <span class="Li">&quot;Class::XSAccessor&quot;</span>-based classes were
    loaded in a subthread without having been loaded in the &quot;main&quot;
    thread. If the subthread then terminated, a hash key and an int per
    associated method used to be lost. Note that this mattered only if classes
    were <b>only</b> loaded in a sort of throw-away thread.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the new implementation, as of 1.00, the memory will still not
    be released, in the same situation, but it will be recycled when the same
    class, or a similar class, is loaded again in <b>any</b> thread.</p>
