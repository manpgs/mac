<p class="Pp">This module has a very simple task - to be a base class for
    PerlSAX drivers and filters. It's default behaviour is to pass the input
    directly to the output unchanged. It can be useful to use this module as a
    base class so you don't have to, for example, implement the
    <i>characters()</i> callback.</p>
<p class="Pp">The main advantages that it provides are easy dispatching of
    events the right way (ie it takes care for you of checking that the handler
    has implemented that method, or has defined an AUTOLOAD), and the guarantee
    that filters will pass along events that they aren't implementing to
    handlers downstream that might nevertheless be interested in them.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="WRITING_SAX_DRIVERS_AND_FILTERS"><a class="permalink" href="#WRITING_SAX_DRIVERS_AND_FILTERS">WRITING
  SAX DRIVERS AND FILTERS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The Perl Sax API Reference is at
    &lt;http://perl-xml.sourceforge.net/perl-sax/&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Writing SAX Filters is tremendously easy: all you need to do is
    inherit from this module, and define the events you want to handle. A more
    detailed explanation can be found at
    http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/10/10/sax-filters.html.</p>
<p class="Pp">Writing Drivers is equally simple. The one thing you need to pay
    attention to is <b>NOT</b> to call events yourself (this applies to Filters
    as well). For instance:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  package MyFilter;
  use base qw(XML::SAX::Base);

  sub start_element {
    my $self = shift;
    my $data = shift;
    # do something
    $self-&gt;{Handler}-&gt;start_element($data); # BAD
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The above example works well as precisely that: an example. But it
    has several faults: 1) it doesn't test to see whether the handler defines
    start_element. Perhaps it doesn't want to see that event, in which case you
    shouldn't throw it (otherwise it'll die). 2) it doesn't check ContentHandler
    and then Handler (ie it doesn't look to see that the user hasn't requested
    events on a specific handler, and if not on the default one), 3) if it did
    check all that, not only would the code be cumbersome (see this module's
    source to get an idea) but it would also probably have to check for a
    DocumentHandler (in case this were SAX1) and for AUTOLOADs potentially
    defined in all these packages. As you can tell, that would be fairly
    painful. Instead of going through that, simply remember to use code similar
    to the following instead:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  package MyFilter;
  use base qw(XML::SAX::Base);

  sub start_element {
    my $self = shift;
    my $data = shift;
    # do something to filter
    $self-&gt;SUPER::start_element($data); # GOOD (and easy) !
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This way, once you've done your job you hand the ball back to
    XML::SAX::Base and it takes care of all those problems for you!</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the above example doesn't apply to filters only, drivers
    will benefit from the exact same feature.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="METHODS"><a class="permalink" href="#METHODS">METHODS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A number of methods are defined within this class for the purpose
    of inheritance. Some probably don't need to be overridden (eg parse_file)
    but some clearly should be (eg parse). Options for these methods are
    described in the PerlSAX2 specification available from
    http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/~checkout~/perl-xml/libxml-perl/doc/sax-2.0.html?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/html.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>parse
    <p class="Pp">The parse method is the main entry point to parsing documents.
        Internally the parse method will detect what type of &quot;thing&quot;
        you are parsing, and call the appropriate method in your implementation
        class. Here is the mapping table of what is in the Source options (see
        the Perl SAX 2.0 specification for the meaning of these values):</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  Source Contains           parse() calls
  ===============           =============
  CharacterStream (*)       _parse_characterstream($stream, $options)
  ByteStream                _parse_bytestream($stream, $options)
  String                    _parse_string($string, $options)
  SystemId                  _parse_systemid($string, $options)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">However note that these methods may not be sensible if your
        driver class is not for parsing XML. An example might be a DBI driver
        that generates XML/SAX from a database table. If that is the case, you
        likely want to write your own <i>parse()</i> method.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also note that the Source may contain both a PublicId entry,
        and an Encoding entry. To get at these, examine
        <span class="Li">$options</span>-&gt;{Source} as passed to your
      method.</p>
    <p class="Pp">(*) A CharacterStream is a filehandle that does not need any
        encoding translation done on it. This is implemented as a regular
        filehandle and only works under Perl 5.7.2 or higher using PerlIO. To
        get a single character, or number of characters from it, use the perl
        core <i>read()</i> function. To get a single byte from it (or number of
        bytes), you can use <i>sysread()</i>. The encoding of the stream should
        be in the Encoding entry for the Source.</p>
  </li>
  <li>parse_file, parse_uri, parse_string
    <p class="Pp">These are all convenience variations on <i>parse()</i>, and in
        fact simply set up the options before calling it. You probably don't
        need to override these.</p>
  </li>
  <li>get_options
    <p class="Pp">This is a convenience method to get options in SAX2 style, or
        more generically either as hashes or as hashrefs (it returns a hashref).
        You will probably want to use this method in your own implementations of
        <i>parse()</i> and of <i>new()</i>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>get_feature, set_feature
    <p class="Pp">These simply get and set features, and throw the appropriate
        exceptions defined in the specification if need be.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If your subclass defines features not defined in this one,
        then you should override these methods in such a way that they check for
        your features first, and then call the base class's methods for features
        not defined by your class. An example would be:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  sub get_feature {
      my $self = shift;
      my $feat = shift;
      if (exists $MY_FEATURES{$feat}) {
          # handle the feature in various ways
      }
      else {
          return $self-&gt;SUPER::get_feature($feat);
      }
  }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Currently this part is unimplemented.</p>
  </li>
  <li>set_handler
    <p class="Pp">This method takes a handler type (Handler, ContentHandler,
        etc.) and a handler object as arguments, and changes the current handler
        for that handler type, while taking care of resetting the internal state
        that needs to be reset. This allows one to change a handler during parse
        without running into problems (changing it on the parser object directly
        will most likely cause trouble).</p>
  </li>
  <li>set_document_handler, set_content_handler, set_dtd_handler,
      set_lexical_handler, set_decl_handler, set_error_handler,
      set_entity_resolver
    <p class="Pp">These are just simple wrappers around the former method, and
        take a handler object as their argument. Internally they simply call
        set_handler with the correct arguments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>get_handler
    <p class="Pp">The inverse of set_handler, this method takes a an optional
        string containing a handler type (DTDHandler, ContentHandler, etc.
        'Handler' is used if no type is passed). It returns a reference to the
        object that implements that that class, or undef if that handler type is
        not set for the current driver/filter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>get_document_handler, get_content_handler, get_dtd_handler,
      get_lexical_handler, get_decl_handler, get_error_handler,
      get_entity_resolver
    <p class="Pp">These are just simple wrappers around the <i>get_handler()</i>
        method, and take no arguments. Internally they simply call get_handler
        with the correct handler type name.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">It would be rather useless to describe all the methods that this
    module implements here. They are all the methods supported in SAX1 and SAX2.
    In case your memory is a little short, here is a list. The apparent
    duplicates are there so that both versions of SAX can be supported.</p>
