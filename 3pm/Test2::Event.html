<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$trace = $e-&gt;trace</dt>
  <dd>Get a snapshot of the Test2::EventFacet::Trace as it was when this event
      was generated</dd>
  <dt>$bool_or_undef = $e-&gt;related($e2)</dt>
  <dd>Check if 2 events are related. In this case related means their traces
      share a signature meaning they were created with the same context (or at
      the very least by contexts which share an id, which is the same thing
      unless someone is doing something very bad).
    <p class="Pp">This can be used to reliably link multiple events created by
        the same tool. For instance a failing test like
        <span class="Li">&quot;ok(0, &quot;fail&quot;&quot;</span> will generate
        2 events, one being a Test2::Event::Ok, the other being a
        Test2::Event::Diag, both of these events are related having been created
        under the same context and by the same initial tool (though multiple
        tools may have been nested under the initial one).</p>
    <p class="Pp">This will return <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> if
        the relationship cannot be checked, which happens if either event has an
        incomplete or missing trace. This will return <span class="Li">0</span>
        if the traces are complete, but do not match. <span class="Li">1</span>
        will be returned if there is a match.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$e-&gt;add_amnesty({tag =&gt; $TAG, details =&gt; $DETAILS});</dt>
  <dd>This can be used to add amnesty to this event. Amnesty only effects
      failing assertions in most cases, but some formatters may display them for
      passing assertions, or even non-assertions as well.
    <p class="Pp">Amnesty will prevent a failed assertion from causing the
        overall test to fail. In other words it marks a failure as expected and
        allowed.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note:</b> This is how 'TODO' is implemented under the hood.
        TODO is essentially amnesty with the 'TODO' tag. The details are the
        reason for the TODO.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$uuid = $e-&gt;uuid</dt>
  <dd>If UUID tagging is enabled (See Test::API) then any event that has made
      its way through a hub will be tagged with a UUID. A newly created event
      will not yet be tagged in most cases.</dd>
  <dt>$class = $e-&gt;load_facet($name)</dt>
  <dd>This method is used to load a facet by name (or key). It will attempt to
      load the facet class, if it succeeds it will return the class it loaded.
      If it fails it will return <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>. This
      caches the result at the class level so that future calls will be faster.
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$name</span> variable should be the key
        used to access the facet in a facets hashref. For instance the assertion
        facet has the key 'assert', the information facet has the 'info' key,
        and the error facet has the key 'errors'. You may include or omit the
        's' at the end of the name, the method is smart enough to try both the
        's' and no-'s' forms, it will check what you provided first, and if that
        is not found it will add or strip the 's and try again.</p>
  </dd>

  <dd>This returns a list of all facets that have been loaded using the
      <span class="Li">&quot;load_facet()&quot;</span> method. This will not
      return any classes that have not been loaded, or have been loaded directly
      without a call to <span class="Li">&quot;load_facet()&quot;</span>.

  <dt>$hashref = $e-&gt;<b>facet_data()</b></dt>

<p class="Pp"><i>WHAT ARE FACETS?</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Facets are how events convey their purpose to the Test2 internals
    and formatters. An event without facets will have no intentional effect on
    the overall test state, and will not be displayed at all by most formatters,
    except perhaps to say that an event of an unknown type was seen.</p>
<p class="Pp">Facets are produced by the
    <span class="Li">&quot;facet_data()&quot;</span> subroutine, which you
    should nearly-always override.
    <span class="Li">&quot;facet_data()&quot;</span> is expected to return a
    hashref where each key is the facet type, and the value is either a hashref
    with the data for that facet, or an array of hashref's. Some facets must be
    defined as single hashrefs, some must be defined as an array of hashrefs, No
    facets allow both.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;facet_data()&quot;</span> <b>MUST NOT</b>
    bless the data it returns, the main hashref, and nested facet hashref's
    <b>MUST</b> be bare, though items contained within each facet may be
    blessed. The data returned by this method <b>should</b> also be copies of
    the internal data in order to prevent accidental state modification.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;facets()&quot;</span> takes the data from
    <span class="Li">&quot;facet_data()&quot;</span> and blesses it into the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Test2::EventFacet::*&quot;</span> packages. This is
    rarely used however, the EventFacet packages are primarily for convenience
    and documentation. The EventFacet classes are not used at all internally,
    instead the raw data is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is a list of facet types by package. The packages are not
    used internally, but are where the documentation for each type is kept.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note:</b> Every single facet type has the
    <span class="Li">'details'</span> field. This field is always intended for
    human consumption, and when provided, should explain the 'why' for the
    facet. All other fields are facet specific.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="about"><a class="permalink" href="#about">about =&gt; {...}</a></dt>
  <dd>Test2::EventFacet::About
    <p class="Pp">This contains information about the event itself such as the
        event package name. The <span class="Li">&quot;details&quot;</span>
        field for this facet is an overall summary of the event.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="assert"><a class="permalink" href="#assert">assert =&gt;
    {...}</a></dt>
  <dd>Test2::EventFacet::Assert
    <p class="Pp">This facet is used if an assertion was made. The
        <span class="Li">&quot;details&quot;</span> field of this facet is the
        description of the assertion.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="control"><a class="permalink" href="#control">control =&gt;
    {...}</a></dt>
  <dd>Test2::EventFacet::Control
    <p class="Pp">This facet is used to tell the Test2::Event::Hub about special
        actions the event causes. Things like halting all testing, terminating
        the current test, etc. In this facet the
        <span class="Li">&quot;details&quot;</span> field explains why any
        special action was taken.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note:</b> This is how bail-out is implemented.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="meta"><a class="permalink" href="#meta">meta =&gt; {...}</a></dt>
  <dd>Test2::EventFacet::Meta
    <p class="Pp">The meta facet contains all the meta-data attached to the
        event. In this case the <span class="Li">&quot;details&quot;</span>
        field has no special meaning, but may be present if something sets the
        'details' meta-key on the event.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="parent"><a class="permalink" href="#parent">parent =&gt;
    {...}</a></dt>
  <dd>Test2::EventFacet::Parent
    <p class="Pp">This facet contains nested events and similar details for
        subtests. In this facet the <span class="Li">&quot;details&quot;</span>
        field will typically be the name of the subtest.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="plan"><a class="permalink" href="#plan">plan =&gt; {...}</a></dt>
  <dd>Test2::EventFacet::Plan
    <p class="Pp">This facet tells the system that a plan has been set. The
        <span class="Li">&quot;details&quot;</span> field of this is usually
        left empty, but when present explains why the plan is what it is, this
        is most useful if the plan is to skip-all.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="trace"><a class="permalink" href="#trace">trace =&gt; {...}</a></dt>
  <dd>Test2::EventFacet::Trace
    <p class="Pp">This facet contains information related to when and where the
        event was generated. This is how the test file and line number of a
        failure is known. This facet can also help you to tell if tests are
        related.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In this facet the <span class="Li">&quot;details&quot;</span>
        field overrides the &quot;failed at test_file.t line 42.&quot; message
        provided on assertion failure.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="amnesty"><a class="permalink" href="#amnesty">amnesty =&gt; [{...},
    ...]</a></dt>
  <dd>Test2::EventFacet::Amnesty
    <p class="Pp">The amnesty facet is a list instead of a single item, this is
        important as amnesty can come from multiple places at once.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For each instance of amnesty the
        <span class="Li">&quot;details&quot;</span> field explains why amnesty
        was granted.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note:</b> Outside of formatters amnesty only acts to
        forgive a failing assertion.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="errors"><a class="permalink" href="#errors">errors =&gt; [{...},
    ...]</a></dt>
  <dd>Test2::EventFacet::Error
    <p class="Pp">The errors facet is a list instead of a single item, any
        number of errors can be listed. In this facet
        <span class="Li">&quot;details&quot;</span> describes the error, or may
        contain the raw error message itself (such as an exception). In perl
        exception may be blessed objects, as such the raw data for this facet
        may contain nested items which are blessed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Not all errors are considered fatal, there is a
        <span class="Li">&quot;fail&quot;</span> field that must be set for an
        error to cause the test to fail.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note:</b> This facet is unique in that the field name is
        'errors' while the package is 'Error'. This is because this is the only
        facet type that is both a list, and has a name where the plural is not
        the same as the singular. This may cause some confusion, but I feel it
        will be less confusing than the alternative.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="info"><a class="permalink" href="#info">info =&gt; [{...},
    ...]</a></dt>
  <dd>Test2::EventFacet::Info
    <p class="Pp">The 'info' facet is a list instead of a single item, any
        quantity of extra information can be attached to an event. Some
        information may be critical diagnostics, others may be simply commentary
        in nature, this is determined by the
        <span class="Li">&quot;debug&quot;</span> flag.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For this facet the <span class="Li">&quot;details&quot;</span>
        flag is the info itself. This info may be a string, or it may be a data
        structure to display. This is one of the few facet types that may
        contain blessed items.</p>
