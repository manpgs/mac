<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The first recipe demonstrated how to build very basic Moose
    classes, focusing on creating and manipulating attributes. The objects in
    that recipe were very data-oriented, and did not have much in the way of
    behavior (i.e. methods). In this recipe, we expand upon the concepts from
    the first recipe to include some real behavior. In particular, we show how
    you can use a method modifier to implement new behavior for a method.</p>
<p class="Pp">The classes in the SYNOPSIS show two kinds of bank account. A
    simple bank account has one attribute, the balance, and two behaviors,
    depositing and withdrawing money.</p>
<p class="Pp">We then extend the basic bank account in the CheckingAccount
    class. This class adds another attribute, an overdraft account. It also adds
    overdraft protection to the withdraw method. If you try to withdraw more
    than you have, the checking account attempts to reconcile the difference by
    withdrawing money from the overdraft account. (1)</p>
<p class="Pp">The first class, <b>BankAccount</b>, introduces a new attribute
    feature, a default value:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  has 'balance' =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'Int', is =&gt; 'rw', default =&gt; 0 );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This says that a <b>BankAccount</b> has a
    <span class="Li">&quot;balance&quot;</span> attribute, which has an
    <span class="Li">&quot;Int&quot;</span> type constraint, a read/write
    accessor, and a default value of <span class="Li">0</span>. This means that
    every instance of <b>BankAccount</b> that is created will have its
    <span class="Li">&quot;balance&quot;</span> slot initialized to
    <span class="Li">0</span>, unless some other value is provided to the
    constructor.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;deposit&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;withdraw&quot;</span> methods should be fairly
    self-explanatory, as they are just plain old Perl 5 OO. (2)</p>
<p class="Pp">As you know from the first recipe, the keyword
    <span class="Li">&quot;extends&quot;</span> sets a class's superclass. Here
    we see that <b>CheckingAccount</b>
    <span class="Li">&quot;extends&quot;</span> <b>BankAccount</b>. The next
    line introduces yet another new attribute feature, class-based type
    constraints:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  has 'overdraft_account' =&gt; ( isa =&gt; 'BankAccount', is =&gt; 'rw' );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Up until now, we have only seen the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Int&quot;</span> type constraint, which (as we saw in
    the first recipe) is a builtin type constraint. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;BankAccount&quot;</span> type constraint is new, and
    was actually defined the moment we created the <b>BankAccount</b> class
    itself. In fact, Moose creates a corresponding type constraint for every
    class in your program (3).</p>
<p class="Pp">This means that in the first recipe, constraints for both
    <span class="Li">&quot;Point&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Point3D&quot;</span> were created. In this recipe,
    both <span class="Li">&quot;BankAccount&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;CheckingAccount&quot;</span> type constraints are
    created automatically. Moose does this as a convenience so that your classes
    and type constraint can be kept in sync with one another. In short, Moose
    makes sure that it will just DWIM (4).</p>
<p class="Pp">In <b>CheckingAccount</b>, we see another method modifier, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;before&quot;</span> modifier.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  before 'withdraw' =&gt; sub {
      my ( $self, $amount ) = @_;
      my $overdraft_amount = $amount - $self-&gt;balance();
      if ( $self-&gt;overdraft_account &amp;&amp; $overdraft_amount &gt; 0 ) {
          $self-&gt;overdraft_account-&gt;withdraw($overdraft_amount);
          $self-&gt;deposit($overdraft_amount);
      }
  };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Just as with the <span class="Li">&quot;after&quot;</span>
    modifier from the first recipe, Moose will handle calling the superclass
    method (in this case
    <span class="Li">&quot;BankAccount-&gt;withdraw&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;before&quot;</span> modifier will
    (obviously) run <i>before</i> the code from the superclass is run. Here,
    <span class="Li">&quot;before&quot;</span> modifier implements overdraft
    protection by first checking if there are available funds in the checking
    account. If not (and if there is an overdraft account available), it
    transfers the amount needed into the checking account (5).</p>
<p class="Pp">As with the method modifier in the first recipe, we could use
    <span class="Li">&quot;SUPER::&quot;</span> to get the same effect:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  sub withdraw {
      my ( $self, $amount ) = @_;
      my $overdraft_amount = $amount - $self-&gt;balance();
      if ( $self-&gt;overdraft_account &amp;&amp; $overdraft_amount &gt; 0 ) {
          $self-&gt;overdraft_account-&gt;withdraw($overdraft_amount);
          $self-&gt;deposit($overdraft_amount);
      }
      $self-&gt;SUPER::withdraw($amount);
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The benefit of taking the method modifier approach is we do not
    need to remember to call <span class="Li">&quot;SUPER::withdraw&quot;</span>
    and pass it the <span class="Li">$amount</span> argument when writing
    <span class="Li">&quot;CheckingAccount-&gt;withdraw&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is actually more than just a convenience for forgetful
    programmers. Using method modifiers helps isolate subclasses from changes in
    the superclasses. For instance, if <b>BankAccount-&gt;withdraw</b> were to
    add an additional argument of some kind, the version of
    <b>CheckingAccount-&gt;withdraw</b> which uses
    <span class="Li">&quot;SUPER::withdraw&quot;</span> would not pass that
    extra argument correctly, whereas the method modifier version would
    automatically pass along all arguments correctly.</p>
<p class="Pp">Just as with the first recipe, object instantiation uses the
    <span class="Li">&quot;new&quot;</span> method, which accepts named
    parameters.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my $savings_account = BankAccount-&gt;new( balance =&gt; 250 );
  my $checking_account = CheckingAccount-&gt;new(
      balance           =&gt; 100,
      overdraft_account =&gt; $savings_account,
  );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And as with the first recipe, a more in-depth example can be found
    in the <i>t/recipes/basics_bankaccount_methodmodifiersandsubclassing.t</i>
    test file.</p>

  <dd>If you're paying close attention, you might realize that there's a
      circular loop waiting to happen here. A smarter example would have to make
      sure that we don't accidentally create a loop between the checking account
      and its overdraft account.</dd>
  <dt>(2)</dt>
  <dd>Note that for simple methods like these, which just manipulate some single
      piece of data, it is often not necessary to write them at all. For
      instance, <span class="Li">&quot;deposit&quot;</span> could be implemented
      via the <span class="Li">&quot;inc&quot;</span> native delegation for
      counters - see Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native::Trait::Counter for more
      specifics, and Moose::Meta::Attribute::Native for a broader overview.</dd>
  <dt>(3)</dt>
  <dd>In reality, this creation is sensitive to the order in which modules are
      loaded. In more complicated cases, you may find that you need to
      explicitly declare a class type before the corresponding class is
    loaded.</dd>
  <dt>(4)</dt>
  <dd>Moose does not attempt to encode a class's is-a relationships within the
      type constraint hierarchy. Instead, Moose just considers the class type
      constraint to be a subtype of <span class="Li">&quot;Object&quot;</span>,
      and specializes the constraint check to allow for subclasses. This means
      that an instance of <b>CheckingAccount</b> will pass a
      <span class="Li">&quot;BankAccount&quot;</span> type constraint
      successfully. For more details, please refer to the
      Moose::Util::TypeConstraints documentation.</dd>
  <dt>(5)</dt>
  <dd>If the overdraft account does not have the amount needed, it will throw an
      error. Of course, the overdraft account could also have overdraft
      protection. See note 1.</dd>
