<p class="Pp">deprecate - Perl pragma for deprecating the inclusion of a module
    in core</p>
</section>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="permalink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<pre>    use deprecate;  # warn about future absence if loaded from core

<p class="Pp">This pragma simplifies the maintenance of dual-life modules that
    will no longer be included in the Perl core in a future Perl release, but
    are still included currently.</p>
<p class="Pp">The purpose of the pragma is to alert users to the status of such
    a module by issuing a warning that encourages them to install the module
    from CPAN, so that a future upgrade to a perl which omits the module will
    not break their code.</p>
<p class="Pp">This warning will only be issued if the module was loaded from a
    core library directory, which allows the <span class="Li">&quot;use
    deprecate&quot;</span> line to be included in the CPAN version of the
    module. Because the pragma remains silent when the module is run from a
    non-core library directory, the pragma call does not need to be patched into
    or out of either the core or CPAN version of the module. The exact same code
    can be shipped for either purpose.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Important_Caveat"><a class="permalink" href="#Important_Caveat">Important
  Caveat</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Note that when a module installs from CPAN to a core library
    directory rather than the site library directories, the user gains no
    protection from having installed it.</p>
<p class="Pp">At the same time, this pragma cannot detect when such a module has
    installed from CPAN to the core library, and so it would endlessly and
    uselessly exhort the user to upgrade.</p>
<p class="Pp">Therefore modules that can install from CPAN to the core library
    must make sure not to call this pragma when they have done so. Generally
    this means that the exact logic from the installer must be mirrored inside
    the module. E.g.:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    # Makefile.PL
    WriteMakefile(
        # ...
        INSTALLDIRS =&gt; ( &quot;$]&quot; &gt;= 5.011 ? 'site' : 'perl' ),
    );
    # lib/Foo/Bar.pm
    use if &quot;$]&quot; &gt;= 5.011, 'deprecate';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(The above example shows the most important case of this: when the
    target is a Perl older than 5.12 (where the core library directories take
    precedence over the site library directories) and the module being installed
    was included in core in that Perl version. Under those circumstances, an
    upgrade of the module from CPAN is only possible by installing to the core
    library.)</p>

<p class="Pp">None by default. The only method is
    <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span>, called by
    <span class="Li">&quot;use deprecate;&quot;</span>.</p>
