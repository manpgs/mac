<p class="Pp"><b>sasl_client_start()</b> selects a mechanism for authentication
    and starts the authentication session. The mechlist is the list of
    mechanisms the client might like to use. The mechanisms in the list are not
    necessarily supported by the client or even valid. SASL determines which of
    these to use based upon the security preferences specified earlier. The list
    of mechanisms is typically a list of mechanisms the server supports acquired
    from a capability request.</p>
<p class="Pp">If SASL_INTERACT is returned the library needs some values to be
    filled in before it can proceed. The prompt_need structure will be filled in
    with requests. The application should fulfill these requests and call
    sasl_client_start again with identical parameters (the prompt_need parameter
    will be the same pointer as before but filled in by the application).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"><i>mechlist</i> is a list of mechanisms the server has available.
    Punctuation is ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>prompt_need</i> is filled in with a list of prompts needed to
    continue (if necessary).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>clientout</i> and <i>clientoutlen</i> is created. It is the
    initial client response to send to the server. It is the job of the client
    to send it over the network to the server. Any protocol specific encoding
    (such as base64 encoding) necessary needs to be done by the client.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the protocol lacks client-send-first capability, then set
    <i>clientout</i> to NULL.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there is no initial client-send, then <i>*clientout</i> will be
    set to NULL on return.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>mech</i> contains the name of the chosen SASL mechanism (on
    success)</p>
