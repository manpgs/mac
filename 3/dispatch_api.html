<p class="Pp">The following is a brief summary of some of the common design
    patterns to consider when designing and implementing API in terms of
    dispatch queues and blocks.</p>
<p class="Pp">A general recommendation is to allow both a callback block and
    target dispatch queue to be specified. This gives the application the
    greatest flexibility in handling asynchronous events.</p>
<p class="Pp">It's also recommended that interfaces take only a single block as
    the last parameter. This is both for consistency across projects, as well as
    the visual aesthetics of multiline blocks that are declared inline. The
    dispatch queue to which the block will be submitted should immediately
    precede the block argument (second-to-last argument). For example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>read_async(file, callback_queue, ^{
	printf(&quot;received callback.\n&quot;);
});</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">When function pointer alternatives to interfaces that take blocks
    are provided, the argument order of the function signature should be
    identical to the block variant; with the exception that the block argument
    is replaced with a context pointer, and a new last parameter is added, which
    is the function to call.</p>
<p class="Pp">The function based callback should pass the context pointer as the
    first argument, and the subsequent arguments should be identical to the
    block based variant (albeit offset by one in order). It is also important to
    use consistent naming. The dispatch API, for example, uses the suffix
    &quot;_f&quot; for function based variants.</p>
