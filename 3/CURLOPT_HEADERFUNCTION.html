<p class="Pp">Pass a pointer to your callback function, which should match the
    prototype shown above.</p>
<p class="Pp">This function gets called by libcurl as soon as it has received
    header data. The header callback will be called once for each header and
    only complete header lines are passed on to the callback. Parsing headers is
    easy to do using this callback. <i>buffer</i> points to the delivered data,
    and the size of that data is <i>nitems</i>; <i>size</i> is always 1. Do not
    assume that the header line is null-terminated!</p>
<p class="Pp">The pointer named <i>userdata</i> is the one you set with the
    <i>CURLOPT_HEADERDATA(3)</i> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">Your callback should return the number of bytes actually taken
    care of. If that amount differs from the amount passed to your callback
    function, it will signal an error condition to the library. This will cause
    the transfer to get aborted and the libcurl function used will return
    <i>CURLE_WRITE_ERROR</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also abort the transfer by returning CURL_WRITEFUNC_ERROR.
    (7.87.0)</p>
<p class="Pp">A complete HTTP header that is passed to this function can be up
    to <i>CURL_MAX_HTTP_HEADER</i> (100K) bytes and includes the final line
    terminator.</p>
<p class="Pp">If this option is not set, or if it is set to NULL, but
    <i>CURLOPT_HEADERDATA(3)</i> is set to anything but NULL, the function used
    to accept response data will be used instead. That is, it will be the
    function specified with <i>CURLOPT_WRITEFUNCTION(3)</i>, or if it is not
    specified or NULL - the default, stream-writing function.</p>
<p class="Pp">It's important to note that the callback will be invoked for the
    headers of all responses received after initiating a request and not just
    the final response. This includes all responses which occur during
    authentication negotiation. If you need to operate on only the headers from
    the final response, you will need to collect headers in the callback
    yourself and use HTTP status lines, for example, to delimit response
    boundaries.</p>
<p class="Pp">For an HTTP transfer, the status line and the blank line preceding
    the response body are both included as headers and passed to this
  function.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a server sends a chunked encoded transfer, it may contain a
    trailer. That trailer is identical to an HTTP header and if such a trailer
    is received it is passed to the application using this callback as well.
    There are several ways to detect it being a trailer and not an ordinary
    header: 1) it comes after the response-body. 2) it comes after the final
    header line (CR LF) 3) a Trailer: header among the regular response-headers
    mention what header(s) to expect in the trailer.</p>
<p class="Pp">For non-HTTP protocols like FTP, POP3, IMAP and SMTP this function
    will get called with the server responses to the commands that libcurl
    sends.</p>

<p class="Pp">libcurl does not unfold HTTP &quot;folded headers&quot;
    (deprecated since RFC 7230). A folded header is a header that continues on a
    subsequent line and starts with a whitespace. Such folds will be passed to
    the header callback as a separate one, although strictly it is just a
    continuation of the previous line.</p>
