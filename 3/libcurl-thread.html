<p class="Pp">If you are accessing HTTPS or FTPS URLs in a multi-threaded
    manner, you are then of course using the underlying SSL library
    multi-threaded and those libs might have their own requirements on this
    issue. You may need to provide one or two functions to allow it to function
    properly:</p>

  <dd>OpenSSL 1.1.0+ &quot;can be safely used in multi-threaded applications
      provided that support for the underlying OS threading API is
      built-in.&quot; In that case the engine is used by libcurl in a way that
      is fully thread-safe.

<h1 class="Sh" id="Signals"><a class="permalink" href="#Signals">Signals</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Signals are used for timing out name resolves (during DNS lookup)
    - when built without using either the c-ares or threaded resolver backends.
    When using multiple threads you should set the <i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i>
    option to 1L for all handles. Everything will or might work fine except that
    timeouts are not honored during the DNS lookup - which you can work around
    by building libcurl with c-ares or threaded-resolver support. c-ares is a
    library that provides asynchronous name resolves. On some platforms, libcurl
    simply will not function properly multi-threaded unless the
    <i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> option is set.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> is set to 1L, your application
    needs to deal with the risk of a SIGPIPE (that at least the OpenSSL backend
    can trigger). Note that setting <i>CURLOPT_NOSIGNAL(3)</i> to 0L will not
    work in a threaded situation as there will be race where libcurl risks
    restoring the former signal handler while another thread should still ignore
    it.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Name_resolving"><a class="permalink" href="#Name_resolving">Name
  resolving</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>gethostbyname</b> or <b>getaddrinfo</b> and other name
    resolving system calls used by libcurl are provided by your operating system
    and must be thread safe. It is important that libcurl can find and use
    thread safe versions of these and other system calls, as otherwise it cannot
    function fully thread safe. Some operating systems are known to have faulty
    thread implementations. We have previously received problem reports on *BSD
    (at least in the past, they may be working fine these days). Some operating
    systems that are known to have solid and working thread support are Linux,
    Solaris and Windows.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="curl_global_*_functions"><a class="permalink" href="#curl_global_*_functions">curl_global_*
  functions</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">These functions are thread-safe since libcurl 7.84.0 if
    <i>curl_version_info(3)</i> has the <b>CURL_VERSION_THREADSAFE</b> feature
    bit set (most platforms).</p>
<p class="Pp">If these functions are not thread-safe and you are using libcurl
    with multiple threads it is especially important that before use you call
    <i>curl_global_init(3)</i> or <i>curl_global_init_mem(3)</i> to explicitly
    initialize the library and its dependents, rather than rely on the
    &quot;lazy&quot; fail-safe initialization that takes place the first time
    <i>curl_easy_init(3)</i> is called. For an in-depth explanation refer to
    <i>libcurl(3)</i> section <b>GLOBAL CONSTANTS</b>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Memory_functions"><a class="permalink" href="#Memory_functions">Memory
  functions</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">These functions, provided either by your operating system or your
    own replacements, must be thread safe. You can use
    <i>curl_global_init_mem(3)</i> to set your own replacement memory
  functions.</p>
