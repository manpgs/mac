<p class="Pp">Pass a pointer to a linked list of strings with host name resolve
    information to use for requests with this handle. The linked list should be
    a fully valid list of <b>struct curl_slist</b> structs properly filled in.
    Use <i>curl_slist_append(3)</i> to create the list and
    <i>curl_slist_free_all(3)</i> to clean up an entire list.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each single name resolve string should be written using the format
    [+]HOST:PORT:ADDRESS[,ADDRESS]... where HOST is the name libcurl will try to
    resolve, PORT is the port number of the service where libcurl wants to
    connect to the HOST and ADDRESS is one or more numerical IP addresses. If
    you specify multiple ip addresses they need to be separated by comma. If
    libcurl is built to support IPv6, each of the ADDRESS entries can of course
    be either IPv4 or IPv6 style addressing.</p>
<p class="Pp">This option effectively pre-populates the DNS cache with entries
    for the host+port pair so redirects and everything that operations against
    the HOST+PORT will instead use your provided ADDRESS.</p>
<p class="Pp">The optional leading &quot;+&quot; signifies whether the new entry
    should time-out or not. Entries added with &quot;HOST:...&quot; will never
    time-out whereas entries added with &quot;+HOST:...&quot; will time-out just
    like ordinary DNS cache entries.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the DNS cache already has an entry for the given host+port
    pair, then this entry will be removed and a new entry will be created. This
    is because the old entry may have have different addresses or a different
    time-out setting.</p>
<p class="Pp">An ADDRESS provided by this option will only be use if not
    restricted by the setting of <i>CURLOPT_IPRESOLVE(3)</i> to a different IP
    version.</p>
<p class="Pp">Remove names from the DNS cache again, to stop providing these
    fake resolves, by including a string in the linked list that uses the format
    &quot;-HOST:PORT&quot;. The host name must be prefixed with a dash, and the
    host name and port number must exactly match what was already added
    previously.</p>
<p class="Pp">Support for providing the ADDRESS within [brackets] was added in
    7.57.0.</p>
<p class="Pp">Support for providing multiple IP addresses per entry was added in
    7.59.0.</p>
<p class="Pp">Support for adding non-permanent entries by using the
    &quot;+&quot; prefix was added in 7.75.0.</p>
