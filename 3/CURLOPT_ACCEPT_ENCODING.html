<p class="Pp">Pass a char * argument specifying what encoding you would
  like.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sets the contents of the Accept-Encoding: header sent in an HTTP
    request, and enables decoding of a response when a Content-Encoding: header
    is received.</p>
<p class="Pp">libcurl potentially supports several different compressed
    encodings depending on what support that has been built-in.</p>
<p class="Pp">To aid applications not having to bother about what specific
    algorithms this particular libcurl build supports, libcurl allows a
    zero-length string to be set (&quot;&quot;) to ask for an Accept-Encoding:
    header to be used that contains all built-in supported encodings.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, you can specify exactly the encoding or list of
    encodings you want in the response. Four encodings are supported:
    <i>identity</i>, meaning non-compressed, <i>deflate</i> which requests the
    server to compress its response using the zlib algorithm, <i>gzip</i> which
    requests the gzip algorithm, (since curl 7.57.0) <i>br</i> which is brotli
    and (since curl 7.72.0) <i>zstd</i> which is zstd. Provide them in the
    string as a comma-separated list of accepted encodings, like:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
   &quot;br, gzip, deflate&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Set <i>CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING(3)</i> to NULL to explicitly
    disable it, which makes libcurl not send an Accept-Encoding: header and not
    decompress received contents automatically.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also opt to just include the Accept-Encoding: header in
    your request with <i>CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER(3)</i> but then there will be no
    automatic decompressing when receiving data.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is a request, not an order; the server may or may not do it.
    This option must be set (to any non-NULL value) or else any unsolicited
    encoding done by the server is ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">Servers might respond with Content-Encoding even without getting a
    Accept-Encoding: in the request. Servers might respond with a different
    Content-Encoding than what was asked for in the request.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Content-Length: servers send for a compressed response is
    supposed to indicate the length of the compressed content so when auto
    decoding is enabled it may not match the sum of bytes reported by the write
    callbacks (although, sending the length of the non-compressed content is a
    common server mistake).</p>
<p class="Pp">The application does not have to keep the string around after
    setting this option.</p>

<p class="Pp">The specific libcurl you are using must have been built with zlib

    to decompress brotli responses and with the zstd library to decompress zstd
    responses.</p>
