  Description</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This depends on Metal.framework <b>A</b> <b>MPSImage</b> object
    describes a MTLTexture that may have more than 4 channels. Some image types,
    such as those found in convolutional neural networks (CNN) differ from a
    standard texture in that they may have more than 4 channels per image. While
    the channels could hold RGBA data, they will more commonly hold a number of
    structural permutations upon a multi-channel image as the neural network
    progresses. It is not uncommon for each pixel to have 32 or 64 channels in
    it.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>A</b> standard MTLTexture may have no more than 4 channels. The
    additional channels are stored in slices of 2d texture array (i.e. texture
    type is MTLTextureType2DArray) such that 4 consecutive channels are stored
    in each slice of this array. If the number of feature channels is N, number
    of array slices needed is (N+3)/4. E.g. a CNN image with width 3 and height
    2 with 9 channels will be stored as</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>slice 0   RGBA   RGBA  RGBA
          RGBA   RGBA  RGBA
slice 1      RGBA   RGBA   RGBA
             RGBA   RGBA   RGBA         (ASCII art /diagonal offset/ intended to show a Z dimension)
slice 2         R???   R???   R???
                R???   R???   R???
</pre>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
   The width and height of underlying 2d texture array is the same as the width
    and height of the <b>MPSImage</b>. The array length is equal to
    (featureChannels + 3) / 4. Channels marked with ? are just for padding and
    should not contain NaNs or Infs.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>A</b> <b>MPSImage</b> can be container of multiple CNN images
    for batch processing. In order to create a <b>MPSImage</b> that contains N
    images, create <b>MPSImageDescriptor</b> with numberOfImages set to N.</p>
<p class="Pp">Although a <b>MPSImage</b> can contain numberOfImages &gt; 1, the
    actual number of images among these processed by <b>MPSCNNKernel</b> is
    controlled by z-dimension of the clipRect. <b>A</b> <b>MPSCNNKernel</b>
    processes n=clipRect.size.depth images from this collection. The starting
    source image index to process is given by offset.z. The starting index of
    the destination image is given by clipRect.origin.z. The <b>MPSCNNKernel</b>
    takes n=clipRect.size.depth images from tje source at indices [offset.z,
    offset.z+n], processes each independently and stores the result in the
    destination at indices [clipRect.origin.z, clipRect.origin.z+n]
    respectively. Offset.z+n should be &lt;= [src numberOfImage] and
    clipRect.origin.z+n should be &lt;= [dest numberOfImages] and offset.z must
    be &gt;= 0.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example: Suppose <b>MPSCNNConvolution</b> takes an input image
    with 8 channels and outputs an image with 16 channels. The number of slices
    needed in the source 2d texture array is 2 and the number of slices needed
    in the destination 2d array is 4. Suppose the source batch size is 5 and
    destination batch size is 4. (Multiple N-channel images can be processed
    concurrently in a batch.) The number of source slices will be 2*5=10 and
    number of destination slices will be 4*4=16. If you want to process just
    images 2 and 3 of the source and store the result at index 1 and 2 in the
    destination, you may achieve this by setting offset.z=2, clipRect.origin.z=1
    and clipRect.size.depth=2. <b>MPSCNNConvolution</b> will take, in this case,
    slice 4 and 5 of source and produce slices 4 to 7 of destination. Similarly,
    slices 6 and 7 will be used to produce slices 8 to 11 of destination.</p>
<p class="Pp">All MPSCNNKernels process images within each batch independently.
    That is, calling a <b>MPSCNNKernel</b> on an batch is formally the same as
    calling it on each image in the batch one at a time. However, quite a lot of
    CPU and GPU overhead will be avoided if batch processing is used. This is
    especially important for better performance on small images.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the number of feature channels is &lt;= 4 and numberOfImages =
    1 i.e. only one slice is needed to represent a <b>MPSImage</b>, the
    underlying metal texture type will be MTLTextureType2D rather than
    MTLTextureType2DArray.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are also MPSTemporaryImages, intended for use for very
    short-lived image data that are produced and consumed immediately in the
    same MTLCommandBuffer. They are a useful way to minimize CPU-side texture
    allocation costs and greatly reduce the amount of memory used by your image
    pipeline.</p>
<p class="Pp">Creation of the underlying texture may in some cases occur lazily.
    You should in general avoid calling <b>MPSImage.texture</b> except when
    unavoidable to avoid materializing memory for longer than necessary. When
    possible, use the other <b>MPSImage</b> properties to get information about
    the <b>MPSImage</b> instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most MPSImages of 4 or fewer feature channels can generate
    quicklooks output in Xcode for easy visualization of image data in the
    object. MPSTemporaryImages can not.</p>

<h2 class="Ss">- (<b>MPSImageBatch</b> * __nonnull) batchRepresentation </h2>
<p class="Pp">Make a MPSImageBatch that points to the individual images in the
    <b>MPSImage</b> If the original is a temporary image, the result will be a
    temporary image. It will hold 1 readCount on the original. When the
    readCount drops to 0, it will decrement the appropriate counter on the
    parent.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Returns:</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>A</b> MPSImageBatch aliasing the texel storage in the

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">- (<b>MPSImageBatch</b> * __nonnull)
  batchRepresentationWithSubRange: (NSRange) subRange</h2>
<p class="Pp">Make a representation of a <b>MPSImage</b> (batch) as a
    MPSImageBatch Before the MPSImageBatch was introduced, several images could
    be concatenated into a <b>MPSImage</b> as multiple image slices in a
    MTLTexture2DArray to make a image batch. If the image contained more than 4
    feature channels, then each image would have round_up( feature channels / 4)
    slices and the total number of slices in the <b>MPSImage</b> would be slices
    * number of images.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because many devices can operate on texture arrays of no more than
    2048 slices, storage in this format is limited. For example in InceptionV3,
    2048 feature channels at its widest point, the largest batch size that can
    be processed in this way is 4, well under commonly accepted practice for
    training. Consequently, the older batching style is deprecated and the
    MPSImageBatch is introduced. It is also easier to manage sub-batches and to
    concatenate sub-batches for memory management with the MPSImageBatch, so
    this format is favored going forward.</p>
<p class="Pp">To facilitate forward migration, this method will prepare an array
    of MPSImages that each point to the appropriate set of slices in storage for
    the original image. Since they share storage, writes to the parent will
    alter the content of the children, and vice versa.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the original is a temporary image, the result will be a
    temporary image. It will hold 1 readCount on the original. When the
    readCount drops to 0, it will decrement the appropriate counter on the
    parent.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is a much cheaper form of the slice operator, and should be
    used instead when the slice operator does not need to operate out of
  place.</p>

  Application can let MPS framework allocate texture with properties specified
  in imageDescriptor using initWithDevice:<b>MPSImageDescriptor</b> API above.
  However in memory intensive application, you can save memory (and
  allocation/deallocation time) by using <b>MPSTemporaryImage</b> where MPS
  framework aggressively reuse memory underlying textures on same command
  buffer. See <b>MPSTemporaryImage</b> class for details below. However, in
  certain cases, application developer may want more control on allocation,

  using Metal Heaps API. In this case, application can create <b>MPSImage</b>
  from pre-allocated texture using initWithTexture:featureChannels.</div>
<p class="Pp">MTLTextureType of texture can be MTLTextureType2D ONLY if

    set to texture.arrayLength / ((featureChannels + 3)/4).</p>
<p class="Pp">For MTLTextures containing typical image data which application
    may obtain from MetalKit or other libraries such as that drawn from a JPEG
    or PNG, featureChannels should be set to number of valid color channel e.g.
    for RGB data, even thought MTLPixelFormat will be MTLPixelFormatRGBA,
    featureChannels should be set to 3.</p>

<br/>
<i>imageIndex</i> Image index in <b>MPSImage</b> to write to. Use the enum to

  pixelFormat defined in the Image Descriptor. Region is full image, buffer
  width and height is same as <b>MPSImage</b> width and height.</div>
