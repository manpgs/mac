<p class="Pp"><b>sasl_server_start()</b> begins the authentication with the
    mechanism specified with mech. This fails if the mechanism is not supported.
    SASL_OK is returned if the authentication is complete and the user is
    authenticated. SASL_CONTINUE is returned if one or more steps are still
    required in the authentication. All other return values indicate
  failure.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"><i>conn</i> is the SASL context for this connection</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>mech</i> is the mechanism name that the client requested</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>clientin</i> is the client initial response, NULL if the
    protocol lacks support for client-send-first or if the other end did not
    have an initial send. Note that no initial client send is distinct from an
    initial send of a null string, and the protocol MUST account for this
    difference.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"><i>clientinlen</i> is the length of initial response</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>serverout</i> is created by the plugin library. It is the
    initial server response to send to the client. This is allocated/freed by
    the library and it is the job of the client to send it over the network to
    the server. Also protocol specific encoding (such as base64 encoding) must
    needs to be done by the server.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>serveroutlen</i> is set to the length of initial server

<p class="Pp">sasl_server_start returns an integer which corresponds to one of
    the SASL errorcodes. SASL_OK indicates that authentication is completed
    successfully. SASL_CONTINUE indicates success and that there are more steps
    needed in the authentication. All other return codes indicate errors and
    should either be handled or the authentication session should be quit.</p>
