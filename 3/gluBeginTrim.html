<p class="Pp">Use <b>gluBeginTrim</b> to mark the beginning of a trimming loop,
    and <b>gluEndTrim</b> to mark the end of a trimming loop. A trimming loop is
    a set of oriented curve segments (forming a closed curve) that define
    boundaries of a NURBS surface. You include these trimming loops in the
    definition of a NURBS surface, between calls to <b>gluBeginSurface</b> and
    <b>gluEndSurface</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The definition for a NURBS surface can contain many trimming
    loops. For example, if you wrote a definition for a NURBS surface that
    resembled a rectangle with a hole punched out, the definition would contain
    two trimming loops. One loop would define the outer edge of the rectangle;
    the other would define the hole punched out of the rectangle. The
    definitions of each of these trimming loops would be bracketed by a
    <b>gluBeginTrim</b>/<b>gluEndTrim</b> pair.</p>
<p class="Pp">The definition of a single closed trimming loop can consist of
    multiple curve segments, each described as a piecewise linear curve (see
    <b>gluPwlCurve</b>) or as a single NURBS curve (see <b>gluNurbsCurve</b>),
    or as a combination of both in any order. The only library calls that can
    appear in a trimming loop definition (between the calls to
    <b>gluBeginTrim</b> and <b>gluEndTrim</b>) are <b>gluPwlCurve</b> and
    <b>gluNurbsCurve</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The area of the NURBS surface that is displayed is the region in
    the domain to the left of the trimming curve as the curve parameter
    increases. Thus, the retained region of the NURBS surface is inside a
    counterclockwise trimming loop and outside a clockwise trimming loop. For
    the rectangle mentioned earlier, the trimming loop for the outer edge of the
    rectangle runs counterclockwise, while the trimming loop for the punched-out
    hole runs clockwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you use more than one curve to define a single trimming loop,
    the curve segments must form a closed loop (that is, the endpoint of each
    curve must be the starting point of the next curve, and the endpoint of the
    final curve must be the starting point of the first curve). If the endpoints
    of the curve are sufficiently close together but not exactly coincident,
    they will be coerced to match. If the endpoints are not sufficiently close,
    an error results (see <b>gluNurbsCallback</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">If a trimming loop definition contains multiple curves, the
    direction of the curves must be consistent (that is, the inside must be to
    the left of all of the curves). Nested trimming loops are legal as long as
    the curve orientations alternate correctly. If trimming curves are
    self-intersecting, or intersect one another, an error results.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no trimming information is given for a NURBS surface, the
    entire surface is drawn.</p>
