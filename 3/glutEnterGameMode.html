<p class="Pp">glutEnterGameMode is designed to enable high-performance
    fullscreen GLUT rendering, possibly at a different screen display format.
    Calling glutEnterGameMode creates a special fullscreen GLUT window (with its
    own callbacks and OpenGL rendering context state). If the game mode string
    describes a possible screen display format, GLUT also changes the screen
    display format to the one described by the game mode string.
    glutLeaveGameMode leaves the GLUT game mode and returns the screen display
    format to its default format.</p>
<p class="Pp">When game mode is entered, certain GLUT functionality is disable
    to facilitate high-performance fullscreen rendering. GLUT pop-up menus are
    not available while in game mode. Other created windows and subwindows are
    not displayed in GLUT game mode. Game mode will also hide all other
    applications running on the computer's display screen. The intent of these
    restrictions is to eliminate window clipping issues, permit screen display
    format changes, and permit fullscreen rendering optimization such as page
    flipping for fullscreen buffer swaps.</p>
<p class="Pp">After leaving game mode, the GLUT functionality disabled in game
    mode is available again. The game mode window (and its OpenGL rendering
    state) is destroyed when leaving game mode. Any windows and subwindows
    created before entering the game mode are displayed in their previous
    locations. The OpenGL state of normal GLUT windows and subwindows is not
    disturbed by entering and/or leaving game mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following GLUT routines are ignored in game mode:
    glutFullScreen, glutSetWindowTitle, glutSetIconTitle, glutPositionWindow,
    glutReshapeWindow, glutPopWindow, glutPushWindow, glutIconifyWindow,
    glutShowWindow, glutHideWindow.</p>
<p class="Pp">glutEnterGameMode can be called when already in game mode. This
    will destroy the previous game mode window (including any OpenGL rendering
    state) and create a new game mode window with a new OpenGL rendering
    context. Also if glutEnterGameMode is called when already in game mode and
    if the game mode string has changed and describes a possible screen display
    format, the new screen display format takes effect. A reshape callback is
    generated if the game mode window changes size due to a screen display
    format change.</p>
<p class="Pp">Re-entering game mode provides a mechanism for changing the screen
    display format while already in game mode. Note though that the game mode
    window's OpenGL state is lost in this process and the application is
    responsible for re-initializing the newly created game mode window OpenGL
    state when re-entering game mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">Game mode cannot be entered while pop-up menus are in use.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the glutEnterGameMode and glutFullScreen routines
    operate differently. glutFullScreen simply makes the current window match
    the size of the screen. glutFullScreen does not change the screen display
    format and does not disable any GLUT features such as pop-up menus;
    glutFullScreen continues to operate in a &quot;windowed&quot; mode of
    operation. glutEnterGameMode creates a new window style, possibly changes
    the screen display mode, limits GLUT functionality, and hides other
    applications.</p>
