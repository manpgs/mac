<p class="Pp">The kld package is designed for loading kernel drivers both by the
    kernel for loading boot drivers and kextload for loading other drivers. The
    library that contains the kld package is linked with the <b>-l</b><i>kld</i>
    linker flag. For the kernel when linked with the <b>-static</b> flag the
    <b>-l</b><i>kld</i> linker flag will link the library libkld.a. And for
    kextload when linked with the <b>-dynamic</b> flag the <b>-l</b><i>kld</i>
    linker flag will link the library libkld.dylib.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the kernel the <i>kld_load_basefile_from_memory,</i> and
    <i>kld_load_from_memory</i> APIs are provided in the library libkld.a
    compiled with the <b>-static</b> compiler flag. Using this library one must
    define the following variable:</p>
<pre>
	extern char *kld_basefile_name;
</pre>
which is the the name of the base file used for error messages.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">For kextload the <i>kld_load_basefile,</i>
    <i>kld_load_basefile_from_memory,</i> <i>kld_load,</i> and
    <i>kld_load_from_memory</i> APIs are provided in the library libkld.dylib
    compiled with the <b>-dynamic</b> compiler flag.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>kld_load</i> or <i>kld_load_from_memory</i> link edits and
    loads the file specified by <i>object_filename</i> or memory pointed to by
    <i>obj_addr</i> respectively to the base file that was previous loaded with
    a call to <i>kld_load_basefile</i> or
  <i>kld_load_basefile_from_memory.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If the program, in this case the kernel, is to allow the loaded
    object files to use symbols from itself, it must be built with the
    <b>-seglinkedit</b> option of the link editor, <i>ld</i>(1), in order to
    have its symbol table mapped into memory.</p>
<p class="Pp">The symbol table may be trimmed to limit which symbols are allowed
    to be referenced by loaded objects. This can be accomplished with the <b>-s
    filename</b> option to <i>strip</i>(1). For the routines described here,
    only global symbols are used, so local symbols can be removed with the
    <b>-x</b> option to <i>ld</i>(1) or <i>strip</i>(1). Doing so saves space in
    the final program and vastly decreases the time spent by the first call to
    <i>kld_load_from_memory</i> or <i>kld_load_basefile.</i> (This is true of
    the first call in the program, as well as the first call after an invocation
    of <i>kld_unload_all).</i> The first call to <i>kld_load_from_memory</i> or
    <i>kld_load_basefile</i> must go through all the symbols of the program or
    basefile, so if the program has been compiled for debugging (for example),
    it can take orders of magnitude longer.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since the objects loaded with <i>kld_load</i> or
    <i>kld_load_from_memory</i> can only use symbols that appear in the
    executable program, if the program uses a library and wants to make all the
    symbols in that library available to the loaded objects, it must force all
    of the library symbols into the executable. This can be done for all
    libraries with the <b>-all_load</b> option to <i>ld</i>(1) when building the
    executable. This will copy all the library code into the executable.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The object file being loaded will only be successful if there are
    no link edit errors (undefined symbols, etc.). If an error occurs, the
    object file is unloaded automatically. If errors occur the user supplied
    routine will be called:</p>
<pre>
	extern void kld_error_vprintf(const char *format, va_list ap);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the link editing and loading is successful, the address of the
    header of what was loaded is returned through the pointer <i>header_addr</i>
    (if it isn't NULL). If <i>kld_load</i> is successful and the parameter
    <i>output_filename</i> isn't NULL, an object file is written to that
    filename. This file can be used with the <i>gdb</i>(1) <i>add-file</i>
    command to debug the code in the dynamically loaded object. The
    <i>kld_load</i> function returns 1 for success and 0 for failure. If a fatal
    system error (out of memory, etc.) occurs, all future calls to
    <i>kld_load</i> and the other routines described here will fail.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>kld_load_from_memory()</i> is similar to <i>kld_load()</i>, but
    works on memory rather than a file. The argument <i>object_name</i> is the
    name associated with the memory and is used for messages. (It must not be
    NULL.) The arguments <i>object_addr</i> and <i>object_size</i> are the
    memory address and size of the object file. <i>kld_load_from_memory()</i>
    only allows one thin object file (not an archive or ``universal'' file) to
    be loaded.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>kld_lookup()</i> looks up the specified symbol name and returns
    its value indirectly through the pointer <i>value.</i> It returns 1 if it
    finds the symbol, and 0 otherwise. If any errors occur it also calls the
    user supplied <i>kld_error_vprintf</i> routine (For kld_lookup, only
    internal errors can result.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>kld_forget_symbol()</i> causes this package to forget the
    existence of the specified symbol name. This allows a new object to be
    loaded that defines this symbol. All objects loaded before this call will
    continue to use the value of the symbol in effect at the time the object was
    loaded. It returns 1 if it finds the symbol and 0 otherwise. If any errors
    occur it also calls the user supplied <i>kld_error_vprintf</i> routine (For
    this routine, only internal errors can result.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>kld_unload_all()</i> clears out all allocated data structures
    used by these routines. If the parameter <i>deallocate_sets</i> is non-zero,
    the function also unloads all objects that were loaded. If
    <i>deallocate_sets</i> is zero the object sets aren't unloaded, and the
    program can continue to use the code and data loaded. However, further calls
    to the routines described here will no longer know about the symbols in
    those objects. If objects aren't to be allowed access to each other's
    symbols, an <i>kld_unload_all</i> call between calls to <i>kld_load</i>
    allows the objects to be loaded without fear of global symbol names'
    clashing. <i>kld_unload_all</i> returns 1 if it is successful and 0
    otherwise. If any errors occur also calls the user supplied
    <i>kld_error_vprintf</i> routine.</p>
<p class="Pp">The argument to <i>kld_load_basefile</i> specifies a base file,
    whose symbol table is taken as the basis for subsequent <i>kld_load's.</i>
    <i>kld_load_basefile_from_memory</i> is an alternate interface that allows
    mapped ``thin'' object image to be specified rather than a file. The base
    file may be a ``universal'' file, and must contain an architecture that
    would execute on the host; otherwise, it is an error. If the file is a
    universal file, the ``best'' architecture (as defined by what the kernel
    <i>exec</i>(2) would select) is used as the base file.
    <i>kld_load_basefile</i> must be invoked before any call to <i>kld_load.</i>
    Alternatively, it can be called after <i>kld_unload_all</i>, which unloads
    the base file. This call is intended to be used when a program is
    dynamically loading object sets into a program other than itself, where
    <i>base_filename</i> contains the symbol table of the target program. The
    routine <i>kld_address_func</i>, described next, would also be used.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>kld_address_func</i> is passed a pointer to a function,
    <i>func</i>, that will be called from <i>kld_load</i>. The parameter values
    that <i>kld_load</i> will supply to <i>func</i> are the size of the memory
    required for the object being loaded, and the size of the headers (which are
    also included in the calculation of <i>size</i>). The function specified by
    <i>func</i> should return the address where the output is to be link edited.
    <i>kld_address_func</i> is intended to be used when a program is dynamically
    loading objects into a program other than itself; the function allows it to
    pick the place in the address space of the target program.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>kld_set_link_options</i> is passed a mask of options,
    <i>link_options</i>, that are used to control some aspects of the following
    <i>kld_load</i> operations. Passing <i>KLD_STRIP_NONE</i> will stop kld from
    stripping symbols from the output in all cases. By default all symbols are
    stripped for kernel loads and when <i>output_filename</i> is NULL for
    <i>kld_load()</i> and <i>kld_load_from_memory()</i></p>

<p class="Pp">All functions that accept object files or archives also accept

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">There exists one semantic link edit problem with respect to common
    symbols. If an object file is loaded that has common symbols left after the
    symbols have been merged, <i>kld_load</i> has to allocate storage for these
    symbols for the code to run without error. The problem occurs if, on a later
    call to <i>kld_load</i>, one of the common symbols that <i>kld_load</i>
    allocated appears in an object file as a defining symbol (not a common or
    undefined symbol). In this case, <i>kld_load</i> will report the symbol as
    being multiply defined. However, if this combination of object files were
    statically linked, no error would occur.</p>
