<p class="Pp">This function handles transfers on all the added handles that need
    attention in an non-blocking fashion.</p>
<p class="Pp">When an application has found out there's data available for the
    multi_handle or a timeout has elapsed, the application should call this
    function to read/write whatever there is to read or write right now etc.
    <i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i> returns as soon as the reads/writes are done.
    This function does not require that there actually is any data available for
    reading or that data can be written, it can be called just in case. It will
    write the number of handles that still transfer data in the second
    argument's integer-pointer.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the amount of <i>running_handles</i> is changed from the
    previous call (or is less than the amount of easy handles you've added to
    the multi handle), you know that there is one or more transfers less
    &quot;running&quot;. You can then call <i>curl_multi_info_read(3)</i> to get
    information about each individual completed transfer, and that returned info
    includes CURLcode and more. If an added handle fails very quickly, it may
    never be counted as a running_handle. You could use
    <i>curl_multi_info_read(3)</i> to track actual status of the added handles
    in that case.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>running_handles</i> is set to zero (0) on the return of
    this function, there is no longer any transfers in progress.</p>

<p class="Pp">CURLMcode type, general libcurl multi interface error code.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before version 7.20.0 (released on February 9 2010): If you
    receive <i>CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM</i>, this basically means that you
    should call <i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i> again, before you select() on more
    actions. You don't have to do it immediately, but the return code means that
    libcurl may have more data available to return or that there may be more
    data to send off before it is &quot;satisfied&quot;. Do note that
    <i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i> will return <i>CURLM_CALL_MULTI_PERFORM</i>
    only when it wants to be called again <b>immediately</b>. When things are
    fine and there is nothing immediate it wants done, it'll return
    <i>CURLM_OK</i> and you need to wait for &quot;action&quot; and then call
    this function again.</p>
<p class="Pp">This function only returns errors etc regarding the whole multi
    stack. Problems still might have occurred on individual transfers even when
    this function returns <i>CURLM_OK</i>. Use <i>curl_multi_info_read(3)</i> to
    figure out how individual transfers did.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TYPICAL_USAGE"><a class="permalink" href="#TYPICAL_USAGE">TYPICAL
  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Most applications will use <i>curl_multi_fdset(3)</i> to get the
    multi_handle's file descriptors, and <i>curl_multi_timeout(3)</i> to get a
    suitable timeout period, then it'll wait for action on the file descriptors
    using <b>select(3)</b>. As soon as one or more file descriptor is ready,
    <i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i> gets called.</p>
