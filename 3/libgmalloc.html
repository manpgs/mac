<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">libgmalloc</code> is a debugging malloc library
    that can track down insidious bugs in your code or library. If your
    application crashes when using libgmalloc, then you've found a bug.</p>
<p class="Pp">libgmalloc is used in place of the standard system malloc, and
    uses the virtual memory system to identify memory access bugs. Each malloc
    allocation is placed on its own virtual memory page (or pages). By default,
    the returned address for the allocation is positioned such that the end of
    the allocated buffer is at the end of the last page, and the next page after
    that is kept unallocated. Thus, accesses beyond the end of the buffer cause
    a bad access error immediately. When memory is freed, libgmalloc deallocates
    its virtual memory, so reads or writes to the freed buffer cause a bad
    access error. Bugs which had been difficult to isolate become immediately
    obvious, and you'll know exactly which code is causing the problem.</p>
<p class="Pp">Guard Malloc is thread-safe and works for all uses of malloc(),
    Objective-C's alloc method, C++'s new operator, and other functions which
    result in allocation in the malloc heap.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of Mac OS X 10.11, Guard Malloc works with purgeable memory.
    Allocations of *any* size that are allocated through
    malloc_zone_malloc(malloc_default_purgeable_zone(), &lt;size&gt;) are
    handled as purgeable memory. When malloc_make_purgeable() is called for a
    purgeable allocation, the memory is immediately purged. Attempting to access
    that memory will then cause a crash. To access that memory successfully,
    first call malloc_make_nonpurgeable() then recreate the data.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of Mac OS X 10.5, libgmalloc aligns the start of allocated
    buffers on 16-byte boundaries by default, to allow proper use of vector
    instructions (e.g., SSE). (The use of vector instructions is common,
    including in some Mac OS X system libraries. The regular system malloc also
    uses 16-byte alignment.) Because of this 16-byte alignment, up to 15 bytes
    at the end of an allocated block may be excess at the end of the page, and
    libgmalloc will not detect buffer overruns into that area by default. This
    default alignment can be changed with environment variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">libgmalloc is available in /usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib. To use it,
    set this environment variable:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>set DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES to /usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note: it is no longer necessary to set
  DYLD_FORCE_FLAT_NAMESPACE.</p>
<p class="Pp">This tells dyld to use Guard Malloc instead of the standard
    version of malloc. Run the program, and wait for the crash indicating the
    bad access. When the program crashes, examine it in the debugger to identify
    the cause.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of Mac OS X 10.6, libgmalloc can be used with the standard
    malloc stack logging by setting the MallocStackLogging environment variable.
    The <a class="Xr" href="../1/malloc_history">malloc_history(1)</a> command
    can then be used to show backtraces of all malloc and free events made when
    using libgmalloc.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="USING_libgmalloc_WITH_THE_XCODE_DEBUGGER_OR_LLDB"><a class="permalink" href="#USING_libgmalloc_WITH_THE_XCODE_DEBUGGER_OR_LLDB">USING
  libgmalloc WITH THE XCODE DEBUGGER OR LLDB</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Because the goal of libgmalloc is to &quot;encourage&quot; your
    application to crash if memory access errors occur, it is best to run your
    application under a debugger such as the Xcode IDE's debugger, or lldb at
    the command line.</p>
<p class="Pp">To use Guard Malloc with the Xcode debugger, choose Edit Scheme...
    from the Scheme popup. Click on the Diagnostics tab then turn on the Enable
    Guard Malloc check box. Then when launching the target application, Xcode
    automatically sets the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable properly.
    Xcode retains that setting with that executable. To set any of the
    additional environment variables described below, click on the Arguments tab
    in the Scheme editor and add them in the Environment Variables section.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you're using lldb from the command line, use lldb's
    &quot;settings set target.env-vars VAR=VALUE&quot; command to set the
    environment variables. Or simply use the &quot;env VAR=VALUE&quot; command
    alias.</p>

<p class="Pp">Once you have the backtrace, you can examine that line of source
    code to see what variable was accessed, and determine why that address was
    invalid memory. In the example above, notice that it crashes when it tries
    to write one character beyond the end of the malloc'ed buffer it's operating
    on, causing a bad access error when accessing the protected page following
    the string.</p>
<p class="Pp">These sorts of problems may seem minor, especially when the
    application normally behaves correctly. However, they're usually the
    hallmark of intermittent bugs or unexplained crashes in long running
    programs. In normal use, the bug in the example program might have caused no
    problems at all... or it might have trashed the following buffer, leading
    occasionally to corrupted data. If the application had been referencing
    freed memory, the program might have worked fine until the one time where
    the freed memory was immediately reused and modified.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">libgmalloc's behavior can be changed with several additional
    environment variables:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="MALLOC_LOG_FILE"><a class="permalink" href="#MALLOC_LOG_FILE"><code class="Ev">MALLOC_LOG_FILE
    &lt;f&gt;</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Create or append messages to the given file path
      <var class="Fa">&lt;f&gt;</var> instead of writing to the standard error.
      This can be set to /dev/null to completely suppress all output if
      necessary.</dd>
  <dt id="MALLOC_PROTECT_BEFORE"><a class="permalink" href="#MALLOC_PROTECT_BEFORE"><code class="Ev">MALLOC_PROTECT_BEFORE</code></a></dt>
  <dd>If this flag is set, then libgmalloc tries harder to detect buffer
      underruns. Specifically, libgmalloc places the start of the allocated
      buffer at the beginning of a virtual memory page, then protects the page
      before. Buffer underruns then cause an error. The behavior without this
      variable set is to place the end of the buffer at the end of the last page
      of the allocation, and protect the page after.</dd>
  <dt id="MALLOC_FILL_SPACE"><a class="permalink" href="#MALLOC_FILL_SPACE"><code class="Ev">MALLOC_FILL_SPACE</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This flag causes libgmalloc to fill the buffer with 0x55 upon creation.
      This can help catch uninitialized memory problems.</dd>
  <dt id="MALLOC_ALLOW_READS"><a class="permalink" href="#MALLOC_ALLOW_READS"><code class="Ev">MALLOC_ALLOW_READS</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This flag allows the guard page after the buffer to be readable so that
      reads past the ends of buffers do not cause the program to crash. With the
      MALLOC_PROTECT_BEFORE flag set, this command instead sets the guard page
      before the buffer to be readable.</dd>
  <dt id="MALLOC_VECTOR_SIZE"><a class="permalink" href="#MALLOC_VECTOR_SIZE"><code class="Ev">MALLOC_VECTOR_SIZE</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This option is the default alignment, as of Mac OS X 10.5. With this
      option, Guard Malloc places allocations on 16 byte boundaries, because
      vector instructions (e.g., SSE) require buffers to be on 16 byte
      boundaries. (The use of vector instructions is becoming more common in
      some Mac OS X system libraries.)</dd>
  <dt id="MALLOC_WORD_SIZE"><a class="permalink" href="#MALLOC_WORD_SIZE"><code class="Ev">MALLOC_WORD_SIZE</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This flag specifies that Guard Malloc should place allocations on word
      (4-byte) boundaries, with the end of the buffer on the last 4 bytes of the
      page. This option is useful because Carbon assumes that pointers are word
      aligned, and without the word alignment, any program relying on Cocoa or
      Carbon would immediately crash.</dd>
  <dt id="MALLOC_STRICT_SIZE"><a class="permalink" href="#MALLOC_STRICT_SIZE"><code class="Ev">MALLOC_STRICT_SIZE</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This flag specifies that Guard Malloc should always align all allocations
      on single-byte boundaries such that the last byte of the buffer is at the
      end of the page. This will immediately catch even one-byte buffer
      overruns, but applications that use Carbon or Cocoa, or vector
      instructions, may not run properly with this option.</dd>
  <dt id="MALLOC_PERMIT_INSANE_REQUESTS"><a class="permalink" href="#MALLOC_PERMIT_INSANE_REQUESTS"><code class="Ev">MALLOC_PERMIT_INSANE_REQUESTS</code></a></dt>
  <dd>GuardMalloc tries to protect against requests for insane amounts of memory
      by instructing the program to trap (if running under the debugger) if more
      than 100MB is requested. If this environment variable is set, then the
      check is disabled.</dd>
  <dt id="MALLOC_MAXIMUM_VM"><a class="permalink" href="#MALLOC_MAXIMUM_VM"><code class="Ev">MALLOC_MAXIMUM_VM</code></a></dt>
  <dd>To test how a process handles running out of memory, set this variable to
      the maximum size, in bytes, of the allocations for the process (including
      the extra overhead from rounding allocations up to a full page size). When
      this limit is hit, attempts to allocate additional memory return NULL. If
      MALLOC_PERMIT_INSANE_REQUESTS is not set it will also trap (if running
      under the debugger).</dd>
  <dt id="MALLOC_CHECK_HEADER"><a class="permalink" href="#MALLOC_CHECK_HEADER"><code class="Ev">MALLOC_CHECK_HEADER</code></a></dt>
  <dd>This flag is enabled by default, which causes Guard Malloc to check the
      validity of a magic number in the malloc block header when a block is
      freed or reallocated. To turn off this checking, set this environment
      variable to NO or 0.</dd>
  <dt id="MallocStackLogging"><a class="permalink" href="#MallocStackLogging"><code class="Ev">MallocStackLogging</code></a></dt>
  <dd>If this flag is set, then standard system malloc stack logging is enabled.
      The <a class="Xr" href="../1/malloc_history">malloc_history(1)</a> command
      can then be used to show backtraces of all malloc and free events made
      when using libgmalloc.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="MEMORY_VALUES_USED_BY_GUARD_MALLOC"><a class="permalink" href="#MEMORY_VALUES_USED_BY_GUARD_MALLOC">MEMORY
  VALUES USED BY GUARD MALLOC</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">It's often useful to understand how Guard Malloc uses memory when
    debugging. Guard Malloc writes strange byte sequences to catch certain
    problems. If the MALLOC_FILL_SPACE environment variable is set, newly
    allocated buffers will be filled with the value 0x55 in hopes of catching
    references to uninitialized memory.</p>
<p class="Pp">The space right before the buffer is dedicated to header
    information. If MALLOC_PROTECT_BEFORE was set, the header immediately
    follows the buffer. The header is 16 bytes in 32-bit processes and 32 bytes
    in 64-bit processes and is organized as:</p>
<p class="Pp">magic number (0xdeadbeef in 32-bit, or 0xdeadbeefdeadbeef in
    64-bit)
  <br/>
  size of buffer + size of header
  <br/>
  thread id
  <br/>
  magic number again</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CAVEATS"><a class="permalink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Because each allocation requires at least two pages of virtual
    memory, in 32-bit processes only about 500,000 malloc allocations could
    exist before the process runs out of virtual memory.</p>
<p class="Pp">Processes using Guard Malloc may run more slowly. In addition, the
    extra pressure on the virtual memory system when running a process with
    Guard Malloc can cause <a class="Xr" href="../1/top">top(1)</a> to update
    its output more slowly.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't forget -- if there's a memory bug in your program, the
    program will crash in Guard Malloc. This is a feature!</p>
