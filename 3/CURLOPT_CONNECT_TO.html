<p class="Pp">Pass a pointer to a linked list of strings with &quot;connect
    to&quot; information to use for establishing network connections with this
    handle. The linked list should be a fully valid list of <b>struct
    curl_slist</b> structs properly filled in. Use <i>curl_slist_append(3)</i>
    to create the list and <i>curl_slist_free_all(3)</i> to clean up an entire
    list.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each single string should be written using the format
    HOST:PORT:CONNECT-TO-HOST:CONNECT-TO-PORT where HOST is the host of the
    request, PORT is the port of the request, CONNECT-TO-HOST is the host name
    to connect to, and CONNECT-TO-PORT is the port to connect to.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first string that matches the request's host and port is
  used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Dotted numerical IP addresses are supported for HOST and
    CONNECT-TO-HOST. A numerical IPv6 address must be written within
  [brackets].</p>
<p class="Pp">Any of the four values may be empty. When the HOST or PORT is
    empty, the host or port will always match (the request's host or port is
    ignored). When CONNECT-TO-HOST or CONNECT-TO-PORT is empty, the
    &quot;connect to&quot; feature will be disabled for the host or port, and
    the request's host or port will be used to establish the network
  connection.</p>
<p class="Pp">This option is suitable to direct the request at a specific
    server, e.g. at a specific cluster node in a cluster of servers.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;connect to&quot; host and port are only used to
    establish the network connection. They do NOT affect the host and port that
    are used for TLS/SSL (e.g. SNI, certificate verification) or for the
    application protocols.</p>
<p class="Pp">In contrast to <i>CURLOPT_RESOLVE(3)</i>, the option
    <i>CURLOPT_CONNECT_TO(3)</i> does not pre-populate the DNS cache and
    therefore it does not affect future transfers of other easy handles that
    have been added to the same multi handle.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;connect to&quot; host and port are ignored if they are
    equal to the host and the port in the request URL, because connecting to the
    host and the port in the request URL is the default behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">If an HTTP proxy is used for a request having a special
    &quot;connect to&quot; host or port, and the &quot;connect to&quot; host or
    port differs from the request's host and port, the HTTP proxy is
    automatically switched to tunnel mode for this specific request. This is
    necessary because it is not possible to connect to a specific host or port
    in normal (non-tunnel) mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">When this option is passed to <i>curl_easy_setopt(3)</i>, libcurl
    will not copy the entire list so you <b>must</b> keep it around until you no
    longer use this <i>handle</i> for a transfer before you call
    <i>curl_slist_free_all(3)</i> on the list.</p>
