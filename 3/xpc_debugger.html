<p class="Pp">The XPC API will aggressively defend itself against perceived
    misuse. Wherever XPC can definitively detect misuse of its APIs or data
    corruption, it will abort. For example, if the retain count of an object
    underflows by calling
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/xpc_release">xpc_release(3)</a> on it too many
    times, XPC will abort the process.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many frameworks opt to keep the program limping along in such a
    state (and will perhaps print a warning message to the system log), but
    aborting upon detection provides unmistakable warning that there is a bug
    present in the application which should be fixed before shipping.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="Application">When XPC aborts a process, it will place
    information about the condition which triggered the abort in the
    <a class="permalink" href="#Application"><i class="Em">Application Specific
    Information</i></a> section of the crash report. The message will be
    human-readable, prefixed with &quot;XPC API Misuse:&quot;, and the crash
    report will indicate the stack trace which caused the abort.</p>
<p class="Pp">XPC will also abort if it detects unrecoverable data corruption in
    its internal state. The messages for these conditions will be prefixd with
    &quot;Bug in libxpc:&quot;. If you come across such a crash, please file a
    bug and include the generated crash log, system log and steps to reproduce
    (if there are any identifiable steps).</p>
<p class="Pp">Currently, the manner in which XPC aborts the process will result
    in termination due to SIGILL (illegal instruction). The exact signal raised
    may change from release to release (or platform to platform). But on OS X
    Lion, SIGILL may be used as a hint that the process was terminated
    intentionally.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DEBUGGING"><a class="permalink" href="#DEBUGGING">DEBUGGING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When debugging in Xcode or at the gdb command prompt, the debugger
    acts as the exception handler for the process being debugged. As a result,
    if the process is aborted by XPC, no crash report will be generated, and
    thus it may not be obvious why the program was terminated.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="_xpc_api_misuse">As mentioned before, SIGILL is an indication
    that the process was terminated intentionally. If you observe the last frame
    in the crashing stack to be
    <a class="permalink" href="#_xpc_api_misuse"><code class="Fn">_xpc_api_misuse</code></a>(),
    you may use the <code class="Fn">xpc_debugger_api_misuse_info</code>() API
    from within the debugger to obtain a human-readable string describing why
    the process was aborted. For example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent Li">
<pre>Program received signal EXC_BAD_INSTRUCTION, Illegal instruction/operand.
0x000000010012b25e in _xpc_api_misuse ()

$1 = 0x7fff5fbff908 &quot;XPC API Misuse: Over-release of object.&quot;
(gdb)</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This message indicates that
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/xpc_release">xpc_release(3)</a> was called too many
    times on an object.</p>
