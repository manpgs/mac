<p class="Pp">glutFullScreen requests that the current window be made full
    screen. The exact semantics of what full screen means may vary by window
    system. The intent is to make the window as large as possible and disable
    any window decorations or borders added the window system. The window width
    and height are not guaranteed to be the same as the screen width and height,
    but that is the intent of making a window full screen.</p>
<p class="Pp">glutFullScreen is defined to work only on top-level windows.</p>
<p class="Pp">The glutFullScreen requests are not processed immediately. The
    request is executed after returning to the main event loop. This allows
    multiple glutReshapeWindow, glutPositionWindow, and glutFullScreen requests
    to the same window to be coalesced.</p>
<p class="Pp">Subsequent glutReshapeWindow and glutPositionWindow requests on
    the window will disable the full screen status of the window.</p>

  IMPLEMENTATION NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In the X implementation of GLUT, full screen is implemented by
    sizing and positioning the window to cover the entire screen and posting the
    _MOTIF_WM_HINTS property on the window requesting absolutely no decorations.
    Non-Motif window managers may not respond to _MOTIF_WM_HINTS.</p>
