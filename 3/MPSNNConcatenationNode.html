<p class="Pp">Init a node that concatenates feature channels from multiple
    images In some neural network designs, it is necessary to append feature
    channels from one neural network filter to the results of another. If we
    have three image nodes with M, N and O feature channels in them, passed to
    -initWithSources: as @[imageM, imageN, imageO], then feature channels
    [0,M-1] will be drawn from image M, feature channels [M, M+N-1] will be
    drawn from image N and feature channels [M+N, M+N+O-1] will be drawn from
    image O.</p>
<p class="Pp">As all images are padded out to a multiple of four feature
    channels, M, N and O here are also multiples of four, even when the
    MPSImages are not. That is, if the image is 23 feature channels and one
    channel of padding, it takes up 24 feature channels worth of space in the
    concatenated result.</p>
<p class="Pp">Performance Note: Generally, concatenation is free as long as all
    of the sourceNodes are produced by filters in the same <b>MPSNNGraph</b>.
    Most MPSCNNKernels have the ability to write their results at a feature
    channel offset within a target <b>MPSImage</b>. However, if the
    <b>MPSNNImageNode</b> source nodes come from images external to the
    <b>MPSNNGraph</b>, then we have to do a copy operation to assemble the
    concatenated node. As a result, when deciding where to break a large logical
    graph into multiple smaller MPSNNGraphs, it is better for concatenations to
    appear at the ends of subgraphs when possible rather than at the start, to
    the extent that all the images used in the concatenation are produced by
    that subgraph.</p>
