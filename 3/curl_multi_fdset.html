<p class="Pp">This function extracts file descriptor information from a given
    multi_handle. libcurl returns its fd_set sets. The application can use these
    to select() on, but be sure to FD_ZERO them before calling this function as
    <i>curl_multi_fdset(3)</i> only adds its own descriptors, it doesn't zero or
    otherwise remove any others. The <i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i> function
    should be called as soon as one of them is ready to be read from or written
    to.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>read_fd_set</i> argument is not a null pointer, it
    points to an object of type fd_set that on returns specifies the file
    descriptors to be checked for being ready to read.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>write_fd_set</i> argument is not a null pointer, it
    points to an object of type fd_set that on return specifies the file
    descriptors to be checked for being ready to write.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>exc_fd_set</i> argument is not a null pointer, it points
    to an object of type fd_set that on return specifies the file descriptors to
    be checked for error conditions pending.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no file descriptors are set by libcurl, <i>max_fd</i> will
    contain -1 when this function returns. Otherwise it will contain the highest
    descriptor number libcurl set. When libcurl returns -1 in <i>max_fd</i>, it
    is because libcurl currently does something that isn't possible for your
    application to monitor with a socket and unfortunately you can then not know
    exactly when the current action is completed using select(). You then need
    to wait a while before you proceed and call <i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i>
    anyway. How long to wait? Unless <i>curl_multi_timeout(3)</i> gives you a
    lower number, we suggest 100 milliseconds or so, but you may want to test it
    out in your own particular conditions to find a suitable value.</p>
<p class="Pp">When doing select(), you should use <i>curl_multi_timeout(3)</i>
    to figure out how long to wait for action. Call <i>curl_multi_perform(3)</i>
    even if no activity has been seen on the fd_sets after the timeout expires
    as otherwise internal retries and timeouts may not work as you'd think and
    want.</p>
<p class="Pp">If one of the sockets used by libcurl happens to be larger than
    what can be set in an fd_set, which on POSIX systems means that the file
    descriptor is larger than FD_SETSIZE, then libcurl will try to not set it.
    Setting a too large file descriptor in an fd_set implies an out of bounds
    write which can cause crashes, or worse. The effect of NOT storing it will
    possibly save you from the crash, but will make your program NOT wait for
    sockets it should wait for...</p>
