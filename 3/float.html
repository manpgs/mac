<p class="Pp">This page describes the available C floating-point types. For a

<p class="Pp">Floating point numbers are represented in three parts: a
    <b>sign</b>, a <b>mantissa</b> (or <b>significand</b>), and an
    <b>exponent</b>. Given such a representation with sign
    <var class="Fa">s</var>, mantissa <var class="Fa">m</var>, and exponent
    <var class="Fa">e</var>, the corresponding numerical value is
    <var class="Fa">s*m*2**e</var>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Floating-point types differ in the number of bits of accuracy in
    the mantissa (called the <b>precision</b>), and set of available exponents
    (the <b>exponent range</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Floating-point numbers with the maximum available exponent are
    reserved operands, denoting an <b>infinity</b> if the significand is
    precisely zero, and a Not-a-Number, or <b>NaN</b>, otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">Floating-point numbers with the minimum available exponent are
    either <b>zero</b> if the significand is precisely zero, and <b>denormal</b>
    otherwise. Note that zero is signed: +0 and -0 are distinct floating point
    numbers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Floating-point numbers with exponents other than the maximum and
    minimum available are called <b>normal</b> numbers.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PROPERTIES_OF_IEEE-754_FLOATING-POINT"><a class="permalink" href="#PROPERTIES_OF_IEEE-754_FLOATING-POINT">PROPERTIES
  OF IEEE-754 FLOATING-POINT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Basic arithmetic operations in IEEE-754 floating-point are
    <b>correctly rounded</b>: this means that the result delivered is the same
    as the result that would be achieved by computing the exact real-number
    operation on the operands, then rounding the real-number result to a
    floating-point value.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Overflow</b> occurs when the value of the exact result is too
    large in magnitude to be represented in the floating-point type in which the
    computation is being performed; doing so would require an exponent outside
    of the exponent range of the type. By default, computations that result in
    overflow return a signed infinity.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Underflow</b> occurs when the value of the exact result is too
    small in magnitude to be represented as a normal number in the
    floating-point type in which the computation is being performed. By default,
    underflow is gradual, and produces a denormal number or a zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">All floating-points number of a given type are integer multiples
    of the smallest non-zero floating-point number of that type; however, the
    converse is not true. This means that, in the default mode, (x-y) = 0 only
    if x = y.</p>
<p class="Pp">The sign of zero transforms correctly through multiplication and
    division, and is preserved by addition of zeros with like signs, but x - x
    yields +0 for every finite floating-point number x. The only operations that
    reveal the sign of a zero are x/(&#x00B1;0) and copysign(x,&#x00B1;0). In
    particular, comparisons (x &gt; y, x != y, etc) are not affected by the sign
    of zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">The sign of infinity transforms correctly through multiplication
    and division, and infinities are unaffected by addition or subtraction of
    any finite floating-point number. But Inf-Inf, Inf*0, and Inf/Inf are, like
    0/0 or sqrt(-3), invalid operations that produce NaN.</p>
<p class="Pp">NaNs are the default results of invalid operations, and they
    propagate through subsequent arithmetic operations. If x is a NaN, then x !=
    x is TRUE, and every other comparison predicate (x &gt; y, x = y, x &lt;= y,
    etc) evaluates to FALSE, regardless of the value of y. Additionally,
    predicates that entail an ordered comparison (rather than mere equality or
    inequality) signal Invalid Operation when one of the arguments is NaN.</p>
<p class="Pp">IEEE-754 provides five kinds of floating-point <b>exceptions</b>,
    listed below:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
Exception	Default Result

Invalid Operation	NaN or FALSE
Overflow	&#x00B1;Infinity
Divide by Zero	&#x00B1;Infinity
Underflow	Gradual Underflow
Inexact	Rounded Value
</pre>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: An exception is not an error unless it is handled
    incorrectly. What makes a class of exceptions exceptional is that no single
    default response can be satisfactory in every instance. On the other hand,
    because a default response will serve most instances of the exception
    satisfactorily, simply aborting the computation cannot be justified.</p>
<p class="Pp">For each kind of floating-point exception, IEEE-754 provides a
    flag that is raised each time its exception is signaled, and remains raised
    until the program resets it. Programs may test, save, and restore the flags,
    or a subset thereof.</p>

  AND EXPONENT RANGE OF SPECIFIC FLOATING-POINT TYPES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">On both OS X and iOS, the type <var class="Fa">float</var>
    corresponds to IEEE-754 single precision. A single-precision number is
    represented in 32 bits, and has a precision of 24 significant bits, roughly
    like 7 significant decimal digits. 8 bits are used to encode the exponent,
    which gives an exponent range from -126 to 127, inclusive.</p>
<p class="Pp">The header &lt;float.h&gt; defines several useful constants for
    the float type:
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">FLT_MANT_DIG</var> - The number of binary digits in the
    significand of a float.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">FLT_MIN_EXP</var> - One more than the smallest exponent
    available in the float type.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">FLT_MAX_EXP</var> - One more than the largest exponent
    available in the float type.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">FLT_DIG</var> - the precision in decimal digits of a float. A
    decimal value with this many digits, stored as a float, always yields the
    same value up to this many digits when converted back to decimal notation.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">FLT_MIN_10_EXP</var> - the smallest n such that 10**n is a
    non-zero normal number as a float.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">FLT_MAX_10_EXP</var> - the largest n such that 10**n is finite
    as a float.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">FLT_MIN</var> - the smallest positive normal float.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">FLT_MAX</var> - the largest finite float.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">FLT_EPSILON</var> - the difference between 1.0 and the
    smallest float bigger than 1.0.</p>
<p class="Pp">On both OS X and iOS, the type <var class="Fa">double</var>
    corresponds to IEEE-754 double precision. A double-precision number is
    represented in 64 bits, and has a precision of 53 significant bits, roughly
    like 16 significant decimal digits. 11 bits are used to encode the exponent,
    which gives an exponent range from -1022 to 1023, inclusive.</p>
<p class="Pp">The header &lt;float.h&gt; defines several useful constants for
    the double type:
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">DBL_MANT_DIG</var> - The number of binary digits in the
    significand of a double.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">DBL_MIN_EXP</var> - One more than the smallest exponent
    available in the double type.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">DBL_MAX_EXP</var> - One more than the exponent available in
    the double type.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">DBL_DIG</var> - the precision in decimal digits of a double. A
    decimal value with this many digits, stored as a double, always yields the
    same value up to this many digits when converted back to decimal notation.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">DBL_MIN_10_EXP</var> - the smallest n such that 10**n is a
    non-zero normal number as a double.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">DBL_MAX_10_EXP</var> - the largest n such that 10**n is finite
    as a double.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">DBL_MIN</var> - the smallest positive normal double.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">DBL_MAX</var> - the largest finite double.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">DBL_EPSILON</var> - the difference between 1.0 and the
    smallest double bigger than 1.0.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Intel macs, the type <var class="Fa">long double</var>
    corresponds to IEEE-754 double extended precision. A double extended number
    is represented in 80 bits, and has a precision of 64 significant bits,
    roughly like 19 significant decimal digits. 15 bits are used to encode the
    exponent, which gives an exponent range from -16383 to 16384, inclusive.</p>
<p class="Pp">The header &lt;float.h&gt; defines several useful constants for
    the long double type:
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">LDBL_MANT_DIG</var> - The number of binary digits in the
    significand of a long double.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">LDBL_MIN_EXP</var> - One more than the smallest exponent
    available in the long double type.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">LDBL_MAX_EXP</var> - One more than the exponent available in
    the long double type.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">LDBL_DIG</var> - the precision in decimal digits of a long
    double. A decimal value with this many digits, stored as a long double,
    always yields the same value up to this many digits when converted back to
    decimal notation.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">LDBL_MIN_10_EXP</var> - the smallest n such that 10**n is a
    non-zero normal number as a long double.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">LDBL_MAX_10_EXP</var> - the largest n such that 10**n is
    finite as a long double.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">LDBL_MIN</var> - the smallest positive normal long double.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">LDBL_MAX</var> - the largest finite long double.
  <br/>
  <var class="Fa">LDBL_EPSILON</var> - the difference between 1.0 and the
    smallest long double bigger than 1.0.</p>
<p class="Pp">On ARM iOS devices, the type <var class="Fa">long double</var>
    corresponds to IEEE-754 double precision. Thus, the values of the
    <var class="Fa">LDBL_*</var> macros are identical to those of the
    corresponding <var class="Fa">DBL_*</var> macros.</p>
