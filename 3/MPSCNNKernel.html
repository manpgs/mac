  Description</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This depends on Metal.framework Describes a convolution neural
    network kernel. <b>A</b> <b>MPSCNNKernel</b> consumes one <b>MPSImage</b>
    and produces one <b>MPSImage</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
<br/>
        The region overwritten in the destination MPSImage is described
<br/>
        by the clipRect.  The top left corner of the region consumed (ignoring
<br/>
        adjustments for filter size -- e.g. convolution filter size) is given
<br/>
        by the offset. The size of the region consumed is a function of the
<br/>
        clipRect size and any subsampling caused by pixel strides at work,
<br/>
        e.g. MPSCNNPooling.strideInPixelsX/Y.  Where the offset + clipRect
<br/>
        would cause a {x,y} pixel address not in the image to be read, the
<br/>
        edgeMode is used to determine what value to read there.
<br/>
        The Z/depth component of the offset, clipRect.origin and clipRect.size
<br/>
        indexes which images to use. If the MPSImage contains only a single image
<br/>
        then these should be offset.z = 0, clipRect.origin.z = 0
<br/>
        and clipRect.size.depth = 1. If the MPSImage contains multiple images,
<br/>
        clipRect.size.depth refers to number of images to process. Both source
<br/>
        and destination MPSImages must have at least this many images. offset.z
<br/>
        refers to starting source image index. Thus offset.z + clipRect.size.depth must
<br/>
        be &lt;= source.numberOfImages. Similarly, clipRect.origin.z refers to starting
<br/>
        image index in destination. So clipRect.origin.z + clipRect.size.depth must be
<br/>
        &lt;= destination.numberOfImage.
<br/>
        destinationFeatureChannelOffset property can be used to control where the MPSKernel will
<br/>
        start writing in feature channel dimension. For example, if the destination image has
<br/>
        64 channels, and MPSKernel outputs 32 channels, by default channels 0-31 of destination
<br/>
        will be populated by MPSKernel. But if we want this MPSKernel to populate channel 32-63
<br/>
        of the destination, we can set destinationFeatureChannelOffset = 32.
<br/>
        A good example of this is concat (concatenation) operation in Tensor Flow. Suppose
<br/>
        we have a src = w x h x Ni which goes through CNNConvolution_0 which produces
<br/>
        output O0 = w x h x N0 and CNNConvolution_1 which produces output O1 = w x h x N1 followed
<br/>
        by concatenation which produces O = w x h x (N0 + N1). We can achieve this by creating
<br/>
        an MPSImage with dimensions O = w x h x (N0 + N1) and using this as destination of
<br/>
        both convolutions as follows
<br/>
            CNNConvolution0: destinationFeatureChannelOffset = 0, this will output N0 channels starting at
<br/>
                             channel 0 of destination thus populating [0,N0-1] channels.
<br/>
            CNNConvolution1: destinationFeatureChannelOffset = N0, this will output N1 channels starting at
<br/>
                             channel N0 of destination thus populating [N0,N0+N1-1] channels.
<br/>
        A MPSCNNKernel can be saved to disk / network using NSCoders such as NSKeyedArchiver. 
<br/>
        When decoding, the system default MTLDevice will be chosen unless the NSCoder adopts 
<br/>
        the &lt;MPSDeviceProvider&gt; protocol.  To accomplish this you will likely need to subclass your
<br/>
        unarchiver to add this method.

<h2 class="Ss">- (BOOL) appendBatchBarrier </h2>
<p class="Pp">Returns YES if the filter must be run over the entire batch before
    its results may be used Nearly all filters do not need to see the entire
    batch all at once and can operate correctly with partial batches. This
    allows the graph to strip-mine the problem, processing the graph top to
    bottom on a subset of the batch at a time, dramatically reducing memory
    usage. As the full nominal working set for a graph is often so large that it
    may not fit in memory, sub-batching may be required forward progress.</p>
<p class="Pp">Batch normalization statistics on the other hand must complete the
    batch before the statistics may be used to normalize the images in the batch
    in the ensuing normalization filter. Consequently, batch normalization
    statistics requests the graph insert a batch barrier following it by
    returning YES from -appendBatchBarrier. This tells the graph to complete the
    batch before any dependent filters can start. Note that the filter itself
    may still be subject to sub-batching in its operation. All filters must be
    able to function without seeing the entire batch in a single -encode call.
    Carry over state that is accumulated across sub-batches is commonly carried
    in a shared <b>MPSState</b> containing a MTLBuffer. See
    -isResultStateReusedAcrossBatch.</p>
<p class="Pp">Caution: on most supported devices, the working set may be so
    large that the graph may be forced to throw away and recalculate most
    intermediate images in cases where strip-mining can not occur because
    -appendBatchBarrier returns YES. <b>A</b> single batch barrier can commonly
    cause a memory size increase and/or performance reduction by many fold over
    the entire graph. Filters of this variety should be avoided.</p>
<p class="Pp">Default: NO</p>

  destinationImageDescriptorForSourceImages: (NSArray&lt; <b>MPSImage</b> * &gt;
  *__nonnull) sourceImages(NSArray&lt; <b>MPSState</b> * &gt; *__nullable)
  sourceStates</h2>
<p class="Pp">Get a suggested destination image descriptor for a source image
    Your application is certainly free to pass in any destinationImage it likes
    to encodeToCommandBuffer:sourceImage:destinationImage, within reason. This
    is the basic design for iOS 10. This method is therefore not required.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, calculating the <b>MPSImage</b> size and
    <b>MPSCNNKernel</b> properties for each filter can be tedious and
    complicated work, so this method is made available to automate the process.
    The application may modify the properties of the descriptor before a
    <b>MPSImage</b> is made from it, so long as the choice is sensible for the
    kernel in question. Please see individual kernel descriptions for
    restrictions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The expected timeline for use is as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp">1) This method is called: a) The default MPS padding calculation
    is applied. It uses the MPSNNPaddingMethod of the .padding property to
    provide a consistent addressing scheme over the graph. It creates the
    <b>MPSImageDescriptor</b> and adjusts the .offset property of the
    MPSNNKernel. When using a <b>MPSNNGraph</b>, the padding is set using the
    <b>MPSNNFilterNode</b> as a proxy.</p>
<p class="Pp">b) This method may be overridden by <b>MPSCNNKernel</b> subclass
    to achieve any customization appropriate to the object type.</p>
<p class="Pp">c) Source states are then applied in order. These may modify the
    descriptor and may update other object properties. See:
    -destinationImageDescriptorForSourceImages:sourceStates:
    forKernel:suggestedDescriptor: This is the typical way in which MPS may
    attempt to influence the operation of its kernels.</p>
<p class="Pp">d) If the .padding property has a custom padding policy method of
    the same name, it is called. Similarly, it may also adjust the descriptor
    and any <b>MPSCNNKernel</b> properties. This is the typical way in which
    your application may attempt to influence the operation of the MPS
  kernels.</p>
<p class="Pp">2) <b>A</b> result is returned from this method and the caller may
    further adjust the descriptor and kernel properties directly.</p>
<p class="Pp">3) The caller uses the descriptor to make a new <b>MPSImage</b> to
    use as the destination image for the -encode call in step 5.</p>
<p class="Pp">4) The caller calls
    -resultStateForSourceImage:sourceStates:destinationImage: to make any result
    states needed for the kernel. If there isn't one, it will return nil.
    <b>A</b> variant is available to return a temporary state instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">5) a -encode method is called to encode the kernel.</p>
<p class="Pp">The entire process 1-5 is more simply achieved by just calling an
    -encode... method that returns a <b>MPSImage</b> out the left hand sid of
    the method. Simpler still, use the <b>MPSNNGraph</b> to coordinate the
    entire process from end to end. Opportunities to influence the process are
    of course reduced, as (2) is no longer possible with either method. Your
    application may opt to use the five step method if it requires greater
    customization as described, or if it would like to estimate storage in
    advance based on the sum of MPSImageDescriptors before processing a graph.
    Storage estimation is done by using the <b>MPSImageDescriptor</b> to create
    a <b>MPSImage</b> (without passing it a texture), and then call
    -resourceSize. As long as the <b>MPSImage</b> is not used in an encode call
    and the .texture property is not invoked, the underlying MTLTexture is not
    created.</p>
<p class="Pp">No destination state or destination image is provided as an
    argument to this function because it is expected they will be made /
    configured after this is called. This method is expected to auto-configure
    important object properties that may be needed in the ensuing destination
    image and state creation steps.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Parameters:</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><i>sourceImages</i> <b>A</b> array of source images that
  will be passed into the -encode call Since <b>MPSCNNKernel</b> is a unary
  kernel, it is an array of length 1.

    padding policy (see padding property) the filter can do this work itself. If
    you would like to have some input into what sort of <b>MPSImage</b> (e.g.
    temporary vs. regular) or what size it is or where it is allocated, you may
    set the destinationImageAllocator to allocate the image yourself.</p>
<p class="Pp">This method uses the <b>MPSNNPadding</b> padding property to
    figure out how to size the result image and to set the offset property. See
    discussion in <b>MPSNeuralNetworkTypes.h</b>. All images in a batch must
    have <b>MPSImage.numberOfImages</b> = 1.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Parameters:</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><i>commandBuffer</i> The command buffer
<br/>
<i>sourceImage</i> <b>A</b> <b>MPSImage</b> to use as the source images for the
  filter.

<i>outState</i> <b>A</b> new state object is returned here.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>Returns:</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>A</b> <b>MPSImage</b> or <b>MPSTemporaryImage</b>
  allocated per the destinationImageAllocator containing the output of the
  graph. The offset property will be adjusted to reflect the offset used during
  the encode. The returned image will be automatically released when the command
  buffer completes. If you want to keep it around for longer, retain the image.
