<p class="Pp">The <i>zlib</i> library is a general purpose data compression
    library. The code is thread safe, assuming that the standard library
    functions used are thread safe, such as memory allocation routines. It
    provides in-memory compression and decompression functions, including
    integrity checks of the uncompressed data. This version of the library
    supports only one compression method (deflation) but other algorithms may be
    added later with the same stream interface.</p>
<p class="Pp">Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large
    enough or can be done by repeated calls of the compression function. In the
    latter case, the application must provide more input and/or consume the
    output (providing more output space) before each call.</p>
<p class="Pp">The library also supports reading and writing files in
    <i>gzip</i>(1) (.gz) format with an interface similar to that of stdio.</p>
<p class="Pp">The library does not install any signal handler. The decoder
    checks the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never
    crash even in the case of corrupted input.</p>
<p class="Pp">All functions of the compression library are documented in the
    file <i>zlib.h</i>. The distribution source includes examples of use of the
    library in the files <i>test/example.c</i> and <i>test/minigzip.c,</i> as
    well as other examples in the <i>examples/</i> directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">Changes to this version are documented in the file
    <i>ChangeLog</i> that accompanies the source.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>zlib</i> is built in to many languages and operating systems,
    including but not limited to Java, Python, .NET, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Swift, and
    Go.</p>
<p class="Pp">An experimental package to read and write files in the .zip
    format, written on top of <i>zlib</i> by Gilles Vollant (info@winimage.com),
    is available at:</p>
