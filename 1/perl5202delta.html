  <li>AIX now sets the length in <span class="Li">&quot;getsockopt&quot;</span>
      correctly. [GH #13484] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/13484&gt;,
      [cpan #91183] &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=91183&gt;,
      [cpan #85570]
    &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=85570&gt;</li>
  <li>In Perl 5.20.0, <span class="Li">$^N</span> accidentally had the internal
      UTF8 flag turned off if accessed from a code block within a regular
      expression, effectively UTF8-encoding the value. This has been fixed. [GH
      #14211] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14211&gt;</li>
  <li>Various cases where the name of a sub is used (autoload, overloading,
      error messages) used to crash for lexical subs, but have been fixed.</li>
  <li>An assertion failure when parsing <span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span>
      with debugging enabled has been fixed. [GH #14087]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14087&gt;</li>
  <li>Loading UTF8 tables during a regular expression match could cause
      assertion failures under debugging builds if the previous match used the
      very same regular expression. [GH #14081]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14081&gt;</li>
  <li>Due to a mistake in the string-copying logic, copying the value of a state
      variable could instead steal the value and undefine the variable. This
      bug, introduced in Perl 5.20, would happen mostly for long strings (1250
      chars or more), but could happen for any strings under builds with
      copy-on-write disabled. [GH #14175]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14175&gt;</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that could cause perl to execute an infinite loop during
      compilation. [GH #14165]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14165&gt;</li>
  <li>On Win32, restoring in a child pseudo-process a variable that was
      <span class="Li">&quot;local()&quot;</span>ed in a parent pseudo-process
      before the <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span> happened caused memory
      corruption and a crash in the child pseudo-process (and therefore OS
      process). [GH #8641]
    &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/8641&gt;</li>
  <li>Tainted constants evaluated at compile time no longer cause unrelated
      statements to become tainted. [GH #14059]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14059&gt;</li>
  <li>Calling <span class="Li">&quot;write&quot;</span> on a format with a
      <span class="Li">&quot;^**&quot;</span> field could produce a panic in
      <b>sv_chop()</b> if there were insufficient arguments or if the variable
      used to fill the field was empty. [GH #14255]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14255&gt;</li>
  <li>In Perl 5.20.0, <span class="Li">&quot;sort CORE::fake&quot;</span> where
      'fake' is anything other than a keyword started chopping of the last 6
      characters and treating the result as a sort sub name. The previous
      behaviour of treating &quot;CORE::fake&quot; as a sort sub name has been
      restored. [GH #14323]
    &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14323&gt;</li>
  <li>A bug in regular expression patterns that could lead to segfaults and
      other crashes has been fixed. This occurred only in patterns compiled with
      <span class="Li">&quot;/i&quot;</span>, while taking into account the
      current POSIX locale (this usually means they have to be compiled within
      the scope of <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span>), and
      there must be a string of at least 128 consecutive bytes to match. [GH
      #14389] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14389&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;qr/@array(?{block})/&quot;</span> no longer dies
      with &quot;Bizarre copy of ARRAY&quot;. [GH #14292]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14292&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;gmtime&quot;</span> no longer crashes with
      not-a-number values. [GH #14365]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14365&gt;</li>
  <li>Certain syntax errors in substitutions, such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;s/${&lt;&gt;{})//&quot;</span>, would crash, and
      had done so since Perl 5.10. (In some cases the crash did not start
      happening until Perl 5.16.) The crash has, of course, been fixed. [GH
      #14391] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14391&gt;</li>
  <li>A memory leak in some regular expressions, introduced in Perl 5.20.1, has
      been fixed. [GH #14236]
    &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14236&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;formline(&quot;@...&quot;,
      &quot;a&quot;);&quot;</span> would crash. The
      <span class="Li">&quot;FF_CHECKNL&quot;</span> case in
      <b>pp_formline()</b> didn't set the pointer used to mark the chop
      position, which led to the <span class="Li">&quot;FF_MORE&quot;</span>
      case crashing with a segmentation fault. This has been fixed. [GH #14388]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14388&gt; [GH #14425]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14425&gt;</li>
  <li>A possible buffer overrun and crash when parsing a literal pattern during
      regular expression compilation has been fixed. [GH #14416]

<p class="Pp">If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
    recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
    database at https://rt.perl.org/ . There may also be information at
    http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
    a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
