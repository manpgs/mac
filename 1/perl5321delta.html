<p class="Pp">Perl 5.32.1 represents approximately 7 months of development since
    Perl 5.32.0 and contains approximately 7,000 lines of changes across 80
    files from 23 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 1,300 lines of changes to 23 .pm, .t, .c and .h
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.32.1:</p>
<p class="Pp">Adam Hartley, Andy Dougherty, Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsaaker, Dan Book,
    David Mitchell, Graham Knop, Graham Ollis, Hauke D, H.Merijn Brand, Hugo van
    der Sanden, John Lightsey, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Leon
    Timmermans, Max Maischein, Nicolas R., Ricardo Signes, Richard Leach, Sawyer
    X, Sevan Janiyan, Steve Hay, Tom Hukins, Tony Cook.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
