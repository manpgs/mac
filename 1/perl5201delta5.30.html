    <p class="Pp">Due to an oversight, the value specified through
        <b>-Dtargetsh</b> to <i>Configure</i> would end up being ignored by some
        of the build process. This caused perls cross-compiled for Android to
        end up with defective versions of

        <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> and backticks: the commands
        would end up looking for <i>/bin/sh</i> instead of

<p class="Pp">Perl 5.20.1 represents approximately 4 months of development since
    Perl 5.20.0 and contains approximately 12,000 lines of changes across 170
    files from 36 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 2,600 lines of changes to 110 .pm, .t, .c and .h
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.20.1:</p>
<p class="Pp">Aaron Crane, Abigail, Alberto Simo~es, Alexandr Ciornii, Alexandre
    (Midnite) Jousset, Andrew Fresh, Andy Dougherty, Brian Fraser, Chris
    'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, Daniel Dragan, David Golden, David

    Rinaldo, Tony Cook, Vladimir Marek, Yves Orton.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p class="Pp">If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
    recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
    database at https://rt.perl.org/ . There may also be information at
    http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
    a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
