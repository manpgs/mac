<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Syntax_of_Variable_Names"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Syntax_of_Variable_Names">The
  Syntax of Variable Names</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Variable names in Perl can have several formats. Usually, they
    must begin with a letter or underscore, in which case they can be
    arbitrarily long (up to an internal limit of 251 characters) and may contain
    letters, digits, underscores, or the special sequence
    <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;'&quot;</span>. In this case, the part before the
    last <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;'&quot;</span> is taken to be a <i>package
    qualifier</i>; see perlmod.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl variable names may also be a sequence of digits or a single
    punctuation or control character. These names are all reserved for special
    uses by Perl; for example, the all-digits names are used to hold data
    captured by backreferences after a regular expression match. Perl has a
    special syntax for the single-control-character names: It understands
    <span class="Li">&quot;^X&quot;</span> (caret
    <span class="Li">&quot;X&quot;</span>) to mean the
    control-<span class="Li">&quot;X&quot;</span> character. For example, the
    notation <span class="Li">$^W</span> (dollar-sign caret
    <span class="Li">&quot;W&quot;</span>) is the scalar variable whose name is
    the single character control-<span class="Li">&quot;W&quot;</span>. This is
    better than typing a literal control-<span class="Li">&quot;W&quot;</span>
    into your program.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Perl v5.6.0, Perl variable names may be alphanumeric strings
    that begin with control characters (or better yet, a caret). These variables
    must be written in the form <span class="Li">&quot;${^Foo}&quot;</span>; the
    braces are not optional. <span class="Li">&quot;${^Foo}&quot;</span> denotes
    the scalar variable whose name is a
    control-<span class="Li">&quot;F&quot;</span> followed by two
    <span class="Li">&quot;o&quot;</span>'s. These variables are reserved for
    future special uses by Perl, except for the ones that begin with
    <span class="Li">&quot;^_&quot;</span> (control-underscore or
    caret-underscore). No control-character name that begins with
    <span class="Li">&quot;^_&quot;</span> will acquire a special meaning in any
    future version of Perl; such names may therefore be used safely in programs.
    <span class="Li">$^_</span> itself, however, <i>is</i> reserved.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl identifiers that begin with digits, control characters, or
    punctuation characters are exempt from the effects of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;package&quot;</span> declaration and are always
    forced to be in package <span class="Li">&quot;main&quot;</span>; they are
    also exempt from <span class="Li">&quot;strict 'vars'&quot;</span> errors. A
    few other names are also exempt in these ways:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    ENV      STDIN
    INC      STDOUT
    ARGV     STDERR
    ARGVOUT
    SIG
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In particular, the special
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^_XYZ}&quot;</span> variables are always taken to
    be in package <span class="Li">&quot;main&quot;</span>, regardless of any
    <span class="Li">&quot;package&quot;</span> declarations presently in
  scope.</p>
</section>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SPECIAL_VARIABLES"><a class="permalink" href="#SPECIAL_VARIABLES">SPECIAL
  VARIABLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The following names have special meaning to Perl. Most punctuation
    names have reasonable mnemonics, or analogs in the shells. Nevertheless, if
    you wish to use long variable names, you need only say:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use English;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">at the top of your program. This aliases all the short names to
    the long names in the current package. Some even have medium names,
    generally borrowed from <b>awk</b>. To avoid a performance hit, if you don't
    need the <span class="Li">$PREMATCH</span>, <span class="Li">$MATCH</span>,
    or <span class="Li">$POSTMATCH</span> it's best to use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;English&quot;</span> module without them:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use English '-no_match_vars';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Before you continue, note the sort order for variables. In
    general, we first list the variables in case-insensitive,
    almost-lexigraphical order (ignoring the
    <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span> preceding words, as in
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^UNICODE}&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">$^T</span>), although <span class="Li">$_</span> and
    <span class="Li">@_</span> move up to the top of the pile. For variables
    with the same identifier, we list it in order of scalar, array, hash, and
    bareword.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$_</span> is by default a global variable.
    However, as of perl v5.10.0, you can use a lexical version of
    <span class="Li">$_</span> by declaring it in a file or in a block with
    <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span>. Moreover, declaring
    <span class="Li">&quot;our $_&quot;</span> restores the global
    <span class="Li">$_</span> in the current scope. Though this seemed like a
    good idea at the time it was introduced, lexical <span class="Li">$_</span>
    actually causes more problems than it solves. If you call a function that
    expects to be passed information via <span class="Li">$_</span>, it may or
    may not work, depending on how the function is written, there not being any
    easy way to solve this. Just avoid lexical <span class="Li">$_</span>,
    unless you are feeling particularly masochistic. For this reason lexical
    <span class="Li">$_</span> is still experimental and will produce a warning
    unless warnings have been disabled. As with other experimental features, the
    behavior of lexical <span class="Li">$_</span> is subject to change without
    notice, including change into a fatal error.</p>

  <dd>When an array or an array slice is interpolated into a double-quoted

      across <span class="Li">&quot;fork()&quot;</span> calls.
    <p class="Pp">Note for Linux and Debian GNU/kFreeBSD users: Before Perl
        v5.16.0 perl would emulate POSIX semantics on Linux systems using
        LinuxThreads, a partial implementation of POSIX Threads that has since
        been superseded by the Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL).</p>
    <p class="Pp">LinuxThreads is now obsolete on Linux, and caching
        <span class="Li">&quot;getpid()&quot;</span> like this made embedding
        perl unnecessarily complex (since you'd have to manually update the
        value of $$), so now <span class="Li">$$</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;getppid()&quot;</span> will always return the
        same values as the underlying C library.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Debian GNU/kFreeBSD systems also used LinuxThreads up until
        and including the 6.0 release, but after that moved to FreeBSD thread
        semantics, which are POSIX-like.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To see if your system is affected by this discrepancy check if
        <span class="Li">&quot;getconf GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION | grep -q
        NPTL&quot;</span> returns a false value. NTPL threads preserve the POSIX
        semantics.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Mnemonic: same as shells.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>$PROGRAM_NAME</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>$0</dt>
  <dd>Contains the name of the program being executed.
    <p class="Pp">On some (but not all) operating systems assigning to
        <span class="Li">$0</span> modifies the argument area that the
        <span class="Li">&quot;ps&quot;</span> program sees. On some platforms
        you may have to use special <span class="Li">&quot;ps&quot;</span>
        options or a different <span class="Li">&quot;ps&quot;</span> to see the
        changes. Modifying the <span class="Li">$0</span> is more useful as a
        way of indicating the current program state than it is for hiding the
        program you're running.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that there are platform-specific limitations on the
        maximum length of <span class="Li">$0</span>. In the most extreme case
        it may be limited to the space occupied by the original
        <span class="Li">$0</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In some platforms there may be arbitrary amount of padding,
        for example space characters, after the modified name as shown by
        <span class="Li">&quot;ps&quot;</span>. In some platforms this padding
        may extend all the way to the original length of the argument area, no
        matter what you do (this is the case for example with Linux 2.2).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note for BSD users: setting <span class="Li">$0</span> does
        not completely remove &quot;perl&quot; from the <i>ps</i>(1) output. For
        example, setting <span class="Li">$0</span> to
        <span class="Li">&quot;foobar&quot;</span> may result in
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl: foobar (perl)&quot;</span> (whether both
        the <span class="Li">&quot;perl: &quot;</span> prefix and the &quot;
        (perl)&quot; suffix are shown depends on your exact BSD variant and
        version). This is an operating system feature, Perl cannot help it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In multithreaded scripts Perl coordinates the threads so that
        any thread may modify its copy of the <span class="Li">$0</span> and the
        change becomes visible to <i>ps</i>(1) (assuming the operating system
        plays along). Note that the view of <span class="Li">$0</span> the other
        threads have will not change since they have their own copies of it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the program has been given to perl via the switches
        <span class="Li">&quot;-e&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;-E&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">$0</span> will
        contain the string <span class="Li">&quot;-e&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On Linux as of perl v5.14.0 the legacy process name will be
        set with <span class="Li">prctl(2)</span>, in addition to altering the
        POSIX name via <span class="Li">&quot;argv[0]&quot;</span> as perl has
        done since version 4.000. Now system utilities that read the legacy
        process name such as ps, top and killall will recognize the name you set
        when assigning to <span class="Li">$0</span>. The string you supply will
        be cut off at 16 bytes, this is a limitation imposed by Linux.</p>

      <span class="Li">&quot;getgroups()&quot;</span>, one of which may be the
      same as the first number.
    <p class="Pp">However, a value assigned to <span class="Li">$(</span> must
        be a single number used to set the real gid. So the value given by
        <span class="Li">$(</span> should <i>not</i> be assigned back to
        <span class="Li">$(</span> without being forced numeric, such as by
        adding zero. Note that this is different to the effective gid
        (<span class="Li">$)</span>) which does take a list.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can change both the real gid and the effective gid at the

      <i>/usr/local/lib/perl</i>, followed by &quot;.&quot;, to represent the

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    use lib '/mypath/libdir/';
    use SomeMod;

    <p class="Pp">You can also insert hooks into the file inclusion system by

  </dd>
  <dt>%SIG</dt>
  <dd>The hash <span class="Li">%SIG</span> contains signal handlers for
      signals. For example:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    sub handler {   # 1st argument is signal name
        my($sig) = @_;
        print &quot;Caught a SIG$sig--shutting down\n&quot;;
        close(LOG);
        exit(0);
        }

    $SIG{'INT'}  = \&amp;handler;
    $SIG{'QUIT'} = \&amp;handler;
    ...
    $SIG{'INT'}  = 'DEFAULT';   # restore default action
    $SIG{'QUIT'} = 'IGNORE';    # ignore SIGQUIT
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Using a value of <span class="Li">'IGNORE'</span> usually has
        the effect of ignoring the signal, except for the
        <span class="Li">&quot;CHLD&quot;</span> signal. See perlipc for more
        about this special case.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here are some other examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    $SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = &quot;Plumber&quot;;   # assumes main::Plumber (not
                                # recommended)
    $SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = \&amp;Plumber;   # just fine; assume current
                                # Plumber
    $SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = *Plumber;    # somewhat esoteric
    $SIG{&quot;PIPE&quot;} = Plumber();   # oops, what did Plumber()
                                # return??
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Be sure not to use a bareword as the name of a signal handler,
        lest you inadvertently call it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If your system has the
        <span class="Li">&quot;sigaction()&quot;</span> function then signal
        handlers are installed using it. This means you get reliable signal
        handling.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The default delivery policy of signals changed in Perl v5.8.0
        from immediate (also known as &quot;unsafe&quot;) to deferred, also
        known as &quot;safe signals&quot;. See perlipc for more information.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Certain internal hooks can be also set using the
        <span class="Li">%SIG</span> hash. The routine indicated by
        <span class="Li">$SIG{__WARN__}</span> is called when a warning message
        is about to be printed. The warning message is passed as the first
        argument. The presence of a <span class="Li">&quot;__WARN__&quot;</span>
        hook causes the ordinary printing of warnings to
        <span class="Li">&quot;STDERR&quot;</span> to be suppressed. You can use
        this to save warnings in a variable, or turn warnings into fatal errors,
        like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub { die $_[0] };
    eval $proggie;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">As the <span class="Li">'IGNORE'</span> hook is not supported
        by <span class="Li">&quot;__WARN__&quot;</span>, you can disable
        warnings using the empty subroutine:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    local $SIG{__WARN__} = sub {};
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The routine indicated by <span class="Li">$SIG{__DIE__}</span>
        is called when a fatal exception is about to be thrown. The error
        message is passed as the first argument. When a
        <span class="Li">&quot;__DIE__&quot;</span> hook routine returns, the
        exception processing continues as it would have in the absence of the
        hook, unless the hook routine itself exits via a
        <span class="Li">&quot;goto &amp;sub&quot;</span>, a loop exit, or a
        <span class="Li">&quot;die()&quot;</span>. The
        <span class="Li">&quot;__DIE__&quot;</span> handler is explicitly
        disabled during the call, so that you can die from a
        <span class="Li">&quot;__DIE__&quot;</span> handler. Similarly for
        <span class="Li">&quot;__WARN__&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Due to an implementation glitch, the
        <span class="Li">$SIG{__DIE__}</span> hook is called even inside an
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval()&quot;</span>. Do not use this to rewrite a
        pending exception in <span class="Li">$@</span>, or as a bizarre
        substitute for overriding
        <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::GLOBAL::die()&quot;</span>. This strange
        action at a distance may be fixed in a future release so that
        <span class="Li">$SIG{__DIE__}</span> is only called if your program is
        about to exit, as was the original intent. Any other use is
      deprecated.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;__DIE__&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;__WARN__&quot;</span>
        handlers are very special in one respect: they may be called to report
        (probable) errors found by the parser. In such a case the parser may be
        in inconsistent state, so any attempt to evaluate Perl code from such a
        handler will probably result in a segfault. This means that warnings or
        errors that result from parsing Perl should be used with extreme
        caution, like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    require Carp if defined $^S;
    Carp::confess(&quot;Something wrong&quot;) if defined &amp;Carp::confess;
    die &quot;Something wrong, but could not load Carp to give &quot;
      . &quot;backtrace...\n\t&quot;
      . &quot;To see backtrace try starting Perl with -MCarp switch&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Here the first line will load
        <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span> <i>unless</i> it is the parser
        who called the handler. The second line will print backtrace and die if
        <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span> was available. The third line
        will be executed only if <span class="Li">&quot;Carp&quot;</span> was
        not available.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Having to even think about the <span class="Li">$^S</span>
        variable in your exception handlers is simply wrong.
        <span class="Li">$SIG{__DIE__}</span> as currently implemented invites
        grievous and difficult to track down errors. Avoid it and use an
        <span class="Li">&quot;END{}&quot;</span> or CORE::GLOBAL::die override
        instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See &quot;die&quot; in perlfunc, &quot;warn&quot; in perlfunc,
        &quot;eval&quot; in perlfunc, and warnings for additional
      information.</p>

    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$^V</span> can be used to determine whether

    <pre>
    warn &quot;Hashes not randomized!\n&quot; if !$^V or $^V lt v5.8.1
    </pre>

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    printf &quot;version is v%vd\n&quot;, $^V;  # Perl's version

    <p class="Pp">See the documentation of <span class="Li">&quot;use

  <dd>If this variable is set to a true value, then

      On the other hand, not opening the file is considerably faster, especially
      for files on network drives.
    <p class="Pp">This variable could be set in the <i>sitecustomize.pl</i> file

    <p class="Pp">Depending on the host operating system, the value of

        the perl program file, or may be the string used to invoke perl but not
        the pathname of the perl program file. Also, most operating systems
        permit invoking programs that are not in the PATH environment variable,
        so there is no guarantee that the value of <span class="Li">$^X</span>
        is in PATH. For VMS, the value may or may not include a version
      number.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You usually can use the value of <span class="Li">$^X</span>
        to re-invoke an independent copy of the same perl that is currently
        running, e.g.,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    @first_run = `$^X -le &quot;print int rand 100 for 1..100&quot;`;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">But recall that not all operating systems support forking or
        capturing of the output of commands, so this complex statement may not
        be portable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is not safe to use the value of <span class="Li">$^X</span>
        as a path name of a file, as some operating systems that have a
        mandatory suffix on executable files do not require use of the suffix
        when invoking a command. To convert the value of
        <span class="Li">$^X</span> to a path name, use the following
        statements:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    # Build up a set of file names (not command names).
    use Config;
    my $this_perl = $^X;

          unless $this_perl =~ m/$Config{_exe}$/i;
        }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Because many operating systems permit anyone with read access
        to the Perl program file to make a copy of it, patch the copy, and then
        execute the copy, the security-conscious Perl programmer should take
        care to invoke the installed copy of perl, not the copy referenced by
        <span class="Li">$^X</span>. The following statements accomplish this
        goal, and produce a pathname that can be invoked as a command or
        referenced as a file.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    use Config;
    my $secure_perl_path = $Config{perlpath};

<h2 class="Ss" id="Variables_related_to_regular_expressions"><a class="permalink" href="#Variables_related_to_regular_expressions">Variables
  related to regular expressions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Most of the special variables related to regular expressions are
    side effects. Perl sets these variables when it has a successful match, so
    you should check the match result before using them. For instance:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    if( /P(A)TT(ER)N/ ) {
        print &quot;I found $1 and $2\n&quot;;
        }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">These variables are read-only and dynamically-scoped, unless we
    note otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">The dynamic nature of the regular expression variables means that
    their value is limited to the block that they are in, as demonstrated by
    this bit of code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    my $outer = 'Wallace and Grommit';
    my $inner = 'Mutt and Jeff';

    my $pattern = qr/(\S+) and (\S+)/;

    sub show_n { print &quot;\$1 is $1; \$2 is $2\n&quot; }

    {
    OUTER:
        show_n() if $outer =~ m/$pattern/;

        INNER: {
            show_n() if $inner =~ m/$pattern/;
            }

        show_n();
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The output shows that while in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;OUTER&quot;</span> block, the values of
    <span class="Li">$1</span> and <span class="Li">$2</span> are from the match
    against <span class="Li">$outer</span>. Inside the
    <span class="Li">&quot;INNER&quot;</span> block, the values of
    <span class="Li">$1</span> and <span class="Li">$2</span> are from the match
    against <span class="Li">$inner</span>, but only until the end of the block
    (i.e. the dynamic scope). After the
    <span class="Li">&quot;INNER&quot;</span> block completes, the values of
    <span class="Li">$1</span> and <span class="Li">$2</span> return to the
    values for the match against <span class="Li">$outer</span> even though we
    have not made another match:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $1 is Wallace; $2 is Grommit
    $1 is Mutt; $2 is Jeff
    $1 is Wallace; $2 is Grommit
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Due to an unfortunate accident of Perl's implementation,
    <span class="Li">&quot;use</span> <span class="Li">English&quot;</span>
    imposes a considerable performance penalty on all regular expression matches
    in a program because it uses the <span class="Li">&quot;$`&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">$&amp;</span>, and <span class="Li">&quot;$'&quot;</span>,
    regardless of whether they occur in the scope of
    <span class="Li">&quot;use</span> <span class="Li">English&quot;</span>. For
    that reason, saying <span class="Li">&quot;use English&quot;</span> in
    libraries is strongly discouraged unless you import it without the match
    variables:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use English '-no_match_vars'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;Devel::NYTProf&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Devel::FindAmpersand&quot;</span> modules can help
    you find uses of these problematic match variables in your code.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Perl v5.10.0, you can use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;/p&quot;</span> match operator flag and the
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^PREMATCH}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^MATCH}&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^POSTMATCH}&quot;</span> variables instead so you
    only suffer the performance penalties.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$&lt;<i>digits</i>&gt; ($1, $2, ...)</dt>
  <dd>Contains the subpattern from the corresponding set of capturing
      parentheses from the last successful pattern match, not counting patterns

<h2 class="Ss" id="Variables_related_to_filehandles"><a class="permalink" href="#Variables_related_to_filehandles">Variables
  related to filehandles</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Variables that depend on the currently selected filehandle may be
    set by calling an appropriate object method on the
    <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Handle&quot;</span> object, although this is less
    efficient than using the regular built-in variables. (Summary lines below
    for this contain the word HANDLE.) First you must say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use IO::Handle;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">after which you may use either</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    method HANDLE EXPR
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or more safely,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    HANDLE-&gt;method(EXPR)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Each method returns the old value of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Handle&quot;</span> attribute. The methods each
    take an optional EXPR, which, if supplied, specifies the new value for the
    <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Handle&quot;</span> attribute in question. If not
    supplied, most methods do nothing to the current value--except for
    <span class="Li">&quot;autoflush()&quot;</span>, which will assume a 1 for
    you, just to be different.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because loading in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Handle&quot;</span> class is an expensive
    operation, you should learn how to use the regular built-in variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">A few of these variables are considered &quot;read-only&quot;.
    This means that if you try to assign to this variable, either directly or
    indirectly through a reference, you'll raise a run-time exception.</p>
<p class="Pp">You should be very careful when modifying the default values of
    most special variables described in this document. In most cases you want to
    localize these variables before changing them, since if you don't, the
    change may affect other modules which rely on the default values of the
    special variables that you have changed. This is one of the correct ways to
    read the whole file at once:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!;
    local $/; # enable localized slurp mode
    my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;
    close $fh;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But the following code is quite bad:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!;
    undef $/; # enable slurp mode
    my $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;
    close $fh;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">since some other module, may want to read data from some file in
    the default &quot;line mode&quot;, so if the code we have just presented has
    been executed, the global value of <span class="Li">$/</span> is now changed
    for any other code running inside the same Perl interpreter.</p>
<p class="Pp">Usually when a variable is localized you want to make sure that
    this change affects the shortest scope possible. So unless you are already
    inside some short <span class="Li">&quot;{}&quot;</span> block, you should
    create one yourself. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    my $content = '';
    open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;foo&quot; or die $!;
    {
        local $/;
        $content = &lt;$fh&gt;;
    }
    close $fh;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here is an example of how your own code can go broken:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for ( 1..3 ){
        $\ = &quot;\r\n&quot;;
        nasty_break();
        print &quot;$_&quot;;
    }

    sub nasty_break {
        $\ = &quot;\f&quot;;
        # do something with $_
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You probably expect this code to print the equivalent of</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    &quot;1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">but instead you get:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    &quot;1\f2\f3\f&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Why? Because <span class="Li">&quot;nasty_break()&quot;</span>
    modifies <span class="Li">&quot;$\&quot;</span> without localizing it first.
    The value you set in <span class="Li">&quot;nasty_break()&quot;</span> is
    still there when you return. The fix is to add
    <span class="Li">&quot;local()&quot;</span> so the value doesn't leak out of
    <span class="Li">&quot;nasty_break()&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    local $\ = &quot;\f&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It's easy to notice the problem in such a short example, but in
    more complicated code you are looking for trouble if you don't localize
    changes to the special variables.</p>

  <dd>Current line number for the last filehandle accessed.
    <p class="Pp">Each filehandle in Perl counts the number of lines that have
        been read from it. (Depending on the value of
        <span class="Li">$/</span>, Perl's idea of what constitutes a line may
        not match yours.) When a line is read from a filehandle (via
        <span class="Li">&quot;readline()&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span>), or when
        <span class="Li">&quot;tell()&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;seek()&quot;</span> is called on it,
        <span class="Li">$.</span> becomes an alias to the line counter for that
        filehandle.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can adjust the counter by assigning to
        <span class="Li">$.</span>, but this will not actually move the seek
        pointer. <i>Localizing </i><i>$.</i><i> will not localize</i> <i>the
        filehandle's line count</i>. Instead, it will localize perl's notion of
        which filehandle <span class="Li">$.</span> is currently aliased to.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$.</span> is reset when the filehandle is
        closed, but <b>not</b> when an open filehandle is reopened without an
        intervening <span class="Li">&quot;close()&quot;</span>. For more
        details, see &quot;I/O Operators&quot; in perlop. Because
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> never does an explicit
        close, line numbers increase across
        <span class="Li">&quot;ARGV&quot;</span> files (but see examples in
        &quot;eof&quot; in perlfunc).</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can also use
        <span class="Li">&quot;HANDLE-&gt;input_line_number(EXPR)&quot;</span>
        to access the line counter for a given filehandle without having to
        worry about which handle you last accessed.</p>

  <dt>$INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>$RS</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>$/</dt>
  <dd>The input record separator, newline by default. This influences Perl's
      idea of what a &quot;line&quot; is. Works like <b>awk</b>'s RS variable,
      including treating empty lines as a terminator if set to the null string
      (an empty line cannot contain any spaces or tabs). You may set it to a
      multi-character string to match a multi-character terminator, or to
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> to read through the end of file.
      Setting it to <span class="Li">&quot;\n\n&quot;</span> means something
      slightly different than setting to <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span>,
      if the file contains consecutive empty lines. Setting to
      <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span> will treat two or more consecutive
      empty lines as a single empty line. Setting to
      <span class="Li">&quot;\n\n&quot;</span> will blindly assume that the next
      input character belongs to the next paragraph, even if it's a newline.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    local $/;           # enable &quot;slurp&quot; mode
    local $_ = &lt;FH&gt;;    # whole file now here
    s/\n[ \t]+/ /g;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Remember: the value of <span class="Li">$/</span> is a string,
        not a regex. <b>awk</b> has to be better for something. :-)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Setting <span class="Li">$/</span> to a reference to an
        integer, scalar containing an integer, or scalar that's convertible to
        an integer will attempt to read records instead of lines, with the
        maximum record size being the referenced integer number of characters.
        So this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    local $/ = \32768; # or \&quot;32768&quot;, or \$var_containing_32768
    open my $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, $myfile or die $!;
    local $_ = &lt;$fh&gt;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will read a record of no more than 32768 characters from
        <span class="Li">$fh</span>. If you're not reading from a
        record-oriented file (or your OS doesn't have record-oriented files),
        then you'll likely get a full chunk of data with every read. If a record
        is larger than the record size you've set, you'll get the record back in
        pieces. Trying to set the record size to zero or less will cause reading
        in the (rest of the) whole file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On VMS only, record reads bypass PerlIO layers and any
        associated buffering, so you must not mix record and non-record reads on
        the same filehandle. Record mode mixes with line mode only when the same
        buffering layer is in use for both modes.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Error_Variables"><a class="permalink" href="#Error_Variables">Error
  Variables</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The variables <span class="Li">$@</span>,
    <span class="Li">$!</span>, <span class="Li">$^E</span>, and
    <span class="Li">$?</span> contain information about different types of
    error conditions that may appear during execution of a Perl program. The
    variables are shown ordered by the &quot;distance&quot; between the
    subsystem which reported the error and the Perl process. They correspond to
    errors detected by the Perl interpreter, C library, operating system, or an
    external program, respectively.</p>
<p class="Pp">To illustrate the differences between these variables, consider
    the following Perl expression, which uses a single-quoted string. After
    execution of this statement, perl may have set all four special error
    variables:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    eval q{
        open my $pipe, &quot;/cdrom/install |&quot; or die $!;
        my @res = &lt;$pipe&gt;;
        close $pipe or die &quot;bad pipe: $?, $!&quot;;
    };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When perl executes the <span class="Li">&quot;eval()&quot;</span>
    expression, it translates the <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;PIPE&gt;&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span> calls in the C run-time library
    and thence to the operating system kernel. perl sets
    <span class="Li">$!</span> to the C library's
    <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span> if one of these calls fails.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$@</span> is set if the string to be
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>-ed did not compile (this may happen
    if <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span> were imported with bad
    prototypes), or if Perl code executed during evaluation
    <span class="Li">&quot;die()&quot;</span>d. In these cases the value of
    <span class="Li">$@</span> is the compile error, or the argument to
    <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span> (which will interpolate
    <span class="Li">$!</span> and <span class="Li">$?</span>). (See also Fatal,
    though.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Under a few operating systems, <span class="Li">$^E</span> may
    contain a more verbose error indicator, such as in this case, &quot;CDROM
    tray not closed.&quot; Systems that do not support extended error messages
    leave <span class="Li">$^E</span> the same as
  <span class="Li">$!</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, <span class="Li">$?</span> may be set to non-0 value if
    the external program <i>/cdrom/install</i> fails. The upper eight bits
    reflect specific error conditions encountered by the program (the program's
    <span class="Li">&quot;exit()&quot;</span> value). The lower eight bits
    reflect mode of failure, like signal death and core dump information. See
    <i>wait</i>(2) for details. In contrast to <span class="Li">$!</span> and
    <span class="Li">$^E</span>, which are set only if error condition is
    detected, the variable <span class="Li">$?</span> is set on each
    <span class="Li">&quot;wait&quot;</span> or pipe
    <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span>, overwriting the old value. This
    is more like <span class="Li">$@</span>, which on every
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval()&quot;</span> is always set on failure and
    cleared on success.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more details, see the individual descriptions at
    <span class="Li">$@</span>, <span class="Li">$!</span>,
    <span class="Li">$^E</span>, and <span class="Li">$?</span>.</p>

    <p class="Pp">Under VMS, <span class="Li">$^E</span> provides the VMS status
        value from the last system error. This is more specific information
        about the last system error than that provided by
        <span class="Li">$!</span>. This is particularly important when
        <span class="Li">$!</span> is set to <b>EVMSERR</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Under OS/2, <span class="Li">$^E</span> is set to the error
        code of the last call to OS/2 API either via CRT, or directly from
      perl.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Under Win32, <span class="Li">$^E</span> always returns the
        last error information reported by the Win32 call
        <span class="Li">&quot;GetLastError()&quot;</span> which describes the
        last error from within the Win32 API. Most Win32-specific code will
        report errors via <span class="Li">$^E</span>. ANSI C and Unix-like
        calls set <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span> and so most portable
        Perl code will report errors via <span class="Li">$!</span>.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>$^H</dt>
  <dd>WARNING: This variable is strictly for internal use only. Its
      availability, behavior, and contents are subject to change without notice.
    <p class="Pp">This variable contains compile-time hints for the Perl
        interpreter. At the end of compilation of a BLOCK the value of this
        variable is restored to the value when the interpreter started to
        compile the BLOCK.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When perl begins to parse any block construct that provides a
        lexical scope (e.g., eval body, required file, subroutine body, loop
        body, or conditional block), the existing value of
        <span class="Li">$^H</span> is saved, but its value is left unchanged.
        When the compilation of the block is completed, it regains the saved
        value. Between the points where its value is saved and restored, code
        that executes within BEGIN blocks is free to change the value of
        <span class="Li">$^H</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This behavior provides the semantic of lexical scoping, and is
        used in, for instance, the <span class="Li">&quot;use
        strict&quot;</span> pragma.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The contents should be an integer; different bits of it are
        used for different pragmatic flags. Here's an example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    sub add_100 { $^H |= 0x100 }

    sub foo {
        BEGIN { add_100() }
        bar-&gt;baz($boon);
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Consider what happens during execution of the BEGIN block. At
        this point the BEGIN block has already been compiled, but the body of
        <span class="Li">&quot;foo()&quot;</span> is still being compiled. The
        new value of <span class="Li">$^H</span> will therefore be visible only
        while the body of <span class="Li">&quot;foo()&quot;</span> is being
        compiled.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Substitution of <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN { add_100()
        }&quot;</span> block with:</p>

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">demonstrates how <span class="Li">&quot;use strict
        'vars'&quot;</span> is implemented. Here's a conditional version of the
        same lexical pragma:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>

        require strict; strict-&gt;import('vars') if $condition

  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;%^H&quot;</span> hash provides the same scoping
      semantic as <span class="Li">$^H</span>. This makes it useful for
      implementation of lexically scoped pragmas. See perlpragma.
    <p class="Pp">When putting items into
        <span class="Li">&quot;%^H&quot;</span>, in order to avoid conflicting
        with other users of the hash there is a convention regarding which keys
        to use. A module should use only keys that begin with the module's name
        (the name of its main package) and a &quot;/&quot; character. For
        example, a module <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::Bar&quot;</span> should
