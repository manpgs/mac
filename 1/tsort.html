<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">tsort</code> takes a list of pairs of node names
    representing directed arcs in a graph and prints the nodes in topological
    order on standard output. Input is taken from the named
    <var class="Ar">file</var>, or from standard input if no file is given.</p>
<p class="Pp">Node names in the input are separated by white space and there
    must be an even number of node pairs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Presence of a node in a graph can be represented by an arc from
    the node to itself. This is useful when a node is not connected to any other
    nodes.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the graph contains a cycle (and therefore cannot be properly
    sorted), one of the arcs in the cycle is ignored and the sort continues.
    Cycles are reported on standard error.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="l"><a class="permalink" href="#l"><code class="Fl">-l</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Search for and display the longest cycle. Can take a very long time.</dd>
  <dt id="q"><a class="permalink" href="#q"><code class="Fl">-q</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not display informational messages about cycles. This is primarily
      intended for building libraries, where optimal ordering is not critical,
      and cycles occur often.</dd>
