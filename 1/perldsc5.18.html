<p class="Pp">Perl lets us have complex data structures. You can write something
    like this and all of a sudden, you'd have an array with three
  dimensions!</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for $x (1 .. 10) {
        for $y (1 .. 10) {
            for $z (1 .. 10) {
                $AoA[$x][$y][$z] =
                    $x ** $y + $z;
            }
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Alas, however simple this may appear, underneath it's a much more
    elaborate construct than meets the eye!</p>
<p class="Pp">How do you print it out? Why can't you say just
    <span class="Li">&quot;print @AoA&quot;</span>? How do you sort it? How can
    you pass it to a function or get one of these back from a function? Is it an
    object? Can you save it to disk to read back later? How do you access whole
    rows or columns of that matrix? Do all the values have to be numeric?</p>
<p class="Pp">As you see, it's quite easy to become confused. While some small
    portion of the blame for this can be attributed to the reference-based
    implementation, it's really more due to a lack of existing documentation
    with examples designed for the beginner.</p>
<p class="Pp">This document is meant to be a detailed but understandable
    treatment of the many different sorts of data structures you might want to
    develop. It should also serve as a cookbook of examples. That way, when you
    need to create one of these complex data structures, you can just pinch,
    pilfer, or purloin a drop-in example from here.</p>
<p class="Pp">Let's look at each of these possible constructs in detail. There
    are separate sections on each of the following:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>arrays of arrays</li>
  <li>hashes of arrays</li>
  <li>arrays of hashes</li>
  <li>hashes of hashes</li>
  <li>more elaborate constructs</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">But for now, let's look at general issues common to all these
    types of data structures.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="REFERENCES"><a class="permalink" href="#REFERENCES">REFERENCES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The most important thing to understand about all data structures
    in Perl--including multidimensional arrays--is that even though they might
    appear otherwise, Perl <span class="Li">@ARRAY</span>s and
    <span class="Li">%HASH</span>es are all internally one-dimensional. They can
    hold only scalar values (meaning a string, number, or a reference). They
    cannot directly contain other arrays or hashes, but instead contain
    <i>references</i> to other arrays or hashes.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can't use a reference to an array or hash in quite the same
    way that you would a real array or hash. For C or C++ programmers unused to
    distinguishing between arrays and pointers to the same, this can be
    confusing. If so, just think of it as the difference between a structure and
    a pointer to a structure.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can (and should) read more about references in perlref.
    Briefly, references are rather like pointers that know what they point to.
    (Objects are also a kind of reference, but we won't be needing them right
    away--if ever.) This means that when you have something which looks to you
    like an access to a two-or-more-dimensional array and/or hash, what's really
    going on is that the base type is merely a one-dimensional entity that
    contains references to the next level. It's just that you can <i>use</i> it
    as though it were a two-dimensional one. This is actually the way almost all
    C multidimensional arrays work as well.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $array[7][12]                       # array of arrays
    $array[7]{string}                   # array of hashes
    $hash{string}[7]                    # hash of arrays
    $hash{string}{'another string'}     # hash of hashes
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now, because the top level contains only references, if you try to
    print out your array in with a simple <i>print()</i> function, you'll get
    something that doesn't look very nice, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @AoA = ( [2, 3], [4, 5, 7], [0] );
    print $AoA[1][2];
  7
    print @AoA;
  ARRAY(0x83c38)ARRAY(0x8b194)ARRAY(0x8b1d0)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That's because Perl doesn't (ever) implicitly dereference your
    variables. If you want to get at the thing a reference is referring to, then
    you have to do this yourself using either prefix typing indicators, like
    <span class="Li">&quot;${$blah}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;@{$blah}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;@{$blah[$i]}&quot;</span>, or else postfix pointer
    arrows, like <span class="Li">&quot;$a-&gt;[3]&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;$h-&gt;{fred}&quot;</span>, or even
    <span class="Li">&quot;$ob-&gt;method()-&gt;[3]&quot;</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMON_MISTAKES"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMON_MISTAKES">COMMON
  MISTAKES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The two most common mistakes made in constructing something like
    an array of arrays is either accidentally counting the number of elements or
    else taking a reference to the same memory location repeatedly. Here's the
    case where you just get the count instead of a nested array:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for $i (1..10) {
        @array = somefunc($i);
        $AoA[$i] = @array;      # WRONG!
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That's just the simple case of assigning an array to a scalar and
    getting its element count. If that's what you really and truly want, then
    you might do well to consider being a tad more explicit about it, like
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for $i (1..10) {
        @array = somefunc($i);
        $counts[$i] = scalar @array;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here's the case of taking a reference to the same memory location
    again and again:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for $i (1..10) {
        @array = somefunc($i);
        $AoA[$i] = \@array;     # WRONG!
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">So, what's the big problem with that? It looks right, doesn't it?
    After all, I just told you that you need an array of references, so by
    golly, you've made me one!</p>
<p class="Pp">Unfortunately, while this is true, it's still broken. All the
    references in <span class="Li">@AoA</span> refer to the <i>very same
    place</i>, and they will therefore all hold whatever was last in
    <span class="Li">@array</span>! It's similar to the problem demonstrated in
    the following C program:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;pwd.h&gt;
    main() {
        struct passwd *getpwnam(), *rp, *dp;
        rp = getpwnam(&quot;root&quot;);
        dp = getpwnam(&quot;daemon&quot;);

        printf(&quot;daemon name is %s\nroot name is %s\n&quot;,
                dp-&gt;pw_name, rp-&gt;pw_name);
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Which will print</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    daemon name is daemon
    root name is daemon
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The problem is that both <span class="Li">&quot;rp&quot;</span>
    and <span class="Li">&quot;dp&quot;</span> are pointers to the same location
    in memory! In C, you'd have to remember to <i>malloc()</i> yourself some new
    memory. In Perl, you'll want to use the array constructor
    <span class="Li">&quot;[]&quot;</span> or the hash constructor
    <span class="Li">&quot;{}&quot;</span> instead. Here's the right way to do
    the preceding broken code fragments:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for $i (1..10) {
        @array = somefunc($i);
        $AoA[$i] = [ @array ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The square brackets make a reference to a new array with a
    <i>copy</i> of what's in <span class="Li">@array</span> at the time of the
    assignment. This is what you want.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that this will produce something similar, but it's much
    harder to read:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for $i (1..10) {
        @array = 0 .. $i;
        @{$AoA[$i]} = @array;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Is it the same? Well, maybe so--and maybe not. The subtle
    difference is that when you assign something in square brackets, you know
    for sure it's always a brand new reference with a new <i>copy</i> of the
    data. Something else could be going on in this new case with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;@{$AoA[$i]}&quot;</span> dereference on the
    left-hand-side of the assignment. It all depends on whether
    <span class="Li">$AoA[$i]</span> had been undefined to start with, or
    whether it already contained a reference. If you had already populated
    <span class="Li">@AoA</span> with references, as in</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $AoA[3] = \@another_array;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Then the assignment with the indirection on the left-hand-side
    would use the existing reference that was already there:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @{$AoA[3]} = @array;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Of course, this <i>would</i> have the &quot;interesting&quot;
    effect of clobbering <span class="Li">@another_array</span>. (Have you ever
    noticed how when a programmer says something is &quot;interesting&quot;,
    that rather than meaning &quot;intriguing&quot;, they're disturbingly more
    apt to mean that it's &quot;annoying&quot;, &quot;difficult&quot;, or both?
    :-)</p>
<p class="Pp">So just remember always to use the array or hash constructors with
    <span class="Li">&quot;[]&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;{}&quot;</span>, and you'll be fine, although it's
    not always optimally efficient.</p>
<p class="Pp">Surprisingly, the following dangerous-looking construct will
    actually work out fine:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for $i (1..10) {
        my @array = somefunc($i);
        $AoA[$i] = \@array;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That's because <i>my()</i> is more of a run-time statement than it
    is a compile-time declaration <i>per se</i>. This means that the <i>my()</i>
    variable is remade afresh each time through the loop. So even though it
    <i>looks</i> as though you stored the same variable reference each time, you
    actually did not! This is a subtle distinction that can produce more
    efficient code at the risk of misleading all but the most experienced of
    programmers. So I usually advise against teaching it to beginners. In fact,
    except for passing arguments to functions, I seldom like to see the
    gimme-a-reference operator (backslash) used much at all in code. Instead, I
    advise beginners that they (and most of the rest of us) should try to use
    the much more easily understood constructors
    <span class="Li">&quot;[]&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;{}&quot;</span> instead of relying upon lexical (or
    dynamic) scoping and hidden reference-counting to do the right thing behind
    the scenes.</p>
<p class="Pp">In summary:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $AoA[$i] = [ @array ];      # usually best
    $AoA[$i] = \@array;         # perilous; just how my() was that array?
    @{ $AoA[$i] } = @array;     # way too tricky for most programmers
</pre>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CAVEAT_ON_PRECEDENCE"><a class="permalink" href="#CAVEAT_ON_PRECEDENCE">CAVEAT
  ON PRECEDENCE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Speaking of things like
    <span class="Li">&quot;@{$AoA[$i]}&quot;</span>, the following are actually
    the same thing:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $aref-&gt;[2][2]       # clear
    $$aref[2][2]        # confusing
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That's because Perl's precedence rules on its five prefix
    dereferencers (which look like someone swearing: <span class="Li">&quot;$ @
    * % &amp;&quot;</span>) make them bind more tightly than the postfix
    subscripting brackets or braces! This will no doubt come as a great shock to
    the C or C++ programmer, who is quite accustomed to using
    <span class="Li">*a[i]</span> to mean what's pointed to by the <i>i'th</i>
    element of <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>. That is, they first take
    the subscript, and only then dereference the thing at that subscript. That's
    fine in C, but this isn't C.</p>
<p class="Pp">The seemingly equivalent construct in Perl,
    <span class="Li">$$aref[$i]</span> first does the deref of
    <span class="Li">$aref</span>, making it take <span class="Li">$aref</span>
    as a reference to an array, and then dereference that, and finally tell you
    the <i>i'th</i> value of the array pointed to by
    <span class="Li">$AoA</span>. If you wanted the C notion, you'd have to
    write <span class="Li">&quot;${$AoA[$i]}&quot;</span> to force the
    <span class="Li">$AoA[$i]</span> to get evaluated first before the leading
    <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> dereferencer.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="WHY_YOU_SHOULD_ALWAYS__use_strict_"><a class="permalink" href="#WHY_YOU_SHOULD_ALWAYS__use_strict_">WHY
  YOU SHOULD ALWAYS &quot;use strict&quot;</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If this is starting to sound scarier than it's worth, relax. Perl
    has some features to help you avoid its most common pitfalls. The best way
    to avoid getting confused is to start every program like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w
    use strict;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This way, you'll be forced to declare all your variables with
    <i>my()</i> and also disallow accidental &quot;symbolic dereferencing&quot;.
    Therefore if you'd done this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    my $aref = [
        [ &quot;fred&quot;, &quot;barney&quot;, &quot;pebbles&quot;, &quot;bambam&quot;, &quot;dino&quot;, ],
        [ &quot;homer&quot;, &quot;bart&quot;, &quot;marge&quot;, &quot;maggie&quot;, ],
        [ &quot;george&quot;, &quot;jane&quot;, &quot;elroy&quot;, &quot;judy&quot;, ],
    ];

    print $aref[2][2];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The compiler would immediately flag that as an error <i>at compile
    time</i>, because you were accidentally accessing
    <span class="Li">@aref</span>, an undeclared variable, and it would thereby
    remind you to write instead:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    print $aref-&gt;[2][2]
</pre>

<p class="Pp">You cannot easily tie a multilevel data structure (such as a hash
    of hashes) to a dbm file. The first problem is that all but GDBM and
    Berkeley DB have size limitations, but beyond that, you also have problems
    with how references are to be represented on disk. One experimental module
    that does partially attempt to address this need is the MLDBM module. Check
    your nearest CPAN site as described in perlmodlib for source code to
  MLDBM.</p>
