  <li>Repeated global pattern matches in scalar context on large tainted strings
      were exponentially slow depending on the current match position in the
      string. [GH #14238]
    &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14238&gt;</li>
  <li>The original visible value of <span class="Li">$/</span> is now preserved
      when it is set to an invalid value. Previously if you set
      <span class="Li">$/</span> to a reference to an array, for example, perl
      would produce a runtime error and not set PL_rs, but Perl code that
      checked <span class="Li">$/</span> would see the array reference. [GH
      #14245] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14245&gt;</li>
  <li>Perl 5.14.0 introduced a bug whereby <span class="Li">&quot;eval { LABEL:
      }&quot;</span> would crash. This has been fixed. [GH #14438]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14438&gt;</li>
  <li>Extending an array cloned from a parent thread could result in
      &quot;Modification of a read-only value attempted&quot; errors when
      attempting to modify the new elements. [GH #14605]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14605&gt;</li>
  <li>Several cases of data used to store environment variable contents in core
      C code being potentially overwritten before being used have been fixed.
      [GH #14476] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14476&gt;</li>
  <li>UTF-8 variable names used in array indexes, unquoted UTF-8 HERE-document
      terminators and UTF-8 function names all now work correctly. [GH #14601]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14601&gt;</li>
  <li>A subtle bug introduced in Perl 5.20.2 involving UTF-8 in regular
      expressions and sometimes causing a crash has been fixed. A new test
      script has been added to test this fix; see under &quot;Testing&quot;. [GH
      #14600] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14600&gt;</li>
  <li>Some patterns starting with <span class="Li">&quot;/.*..../&quot;</span>
      matched against long strings have been slow since Perl 5.8, and some of
      the form <span class="Li">&quot;/.*..../i&quot;</span> have been slow
      since Perl 5.18. They are now all fast again. [GH #14475]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14475&gt;</li>
  <li>Warning fatality is now ignored when rewinding the stack. This prevents
      infinite recursion when the now fatal error also causes rewinding of the
      stack. [GH #14319] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14319&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;setpgrp($nonzero)&quot;</span> (with one argument)
      was accidentally changed in Perl 5.16 to mean
      <span class="Li">setpgrp(0)</span>. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>A crash with <span class="Li">&quot;%::=();
      J-&gt;${\&quot;::&quot;}&quot;</span> has been fixed. [GH #14790]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14790&gt;</li>
  <li>Regular expression possessive quantifier Perl 5.20 regression now fixed.
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr/&quot;</span><i>PAT</i><span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span><i>min</i>,<i>max</i><span class="Li">&quot;}+&quot;</span><span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span>
      is supposed to behave identically to
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr/(?&gt;&quot;</span><i>PAT</i><span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span><i>min</i>,<i>max</i><span class="Li">&quot;})/&quot;</span>.
      Since Perl 5.20, this didn't work if <i>min</i> and <i>max</i> were equal.
      [GH #14857] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14857&gt;</li>
  <li>Code like <span class="Li">&quot;/$a[/&quot;</span> used to read the next
      line of input and treat it as though it came immediately after the opening
      bracket. Some invalid code consequently would parse and run, but some code
      caused crashes, so this is now disallowed. [GH #14462]

<p class="Pp">Perl 5.20.3 represents approximately 7 months of development since
    Perl 5.20.2 and contains approximately 3,200 lines of changes across 99
    files from 26 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 1,500 lines of changes to 43 .pm, .t, .c and .h
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.20.3:</p>
<p class="Pp">Alex Vandiver, Andy Dougherty, Aristotle Pagaltzis, Chris 'BinGOs'
    Williams, Craig A. Berry, Dagfinn Ilmari Mannsaaker, Daniel Dragan, David

<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p class="Pp">If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
    recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
    database at https://rt.perl.org/ . There may also be information at
    http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
    a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
