<p class="Pp">perlport - Writing portable Perl</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Perl runs on numerous operating systems. While most of them share
    much in common, they also have their own unique features.</p>
<p class="Pp">This document is meant to help you to find out what constitutes
    portable Perl code. That way once you make a decision to write portably, you
    know where the lines are drawn, and you can stay within them.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is a tradeoff between taking full advantage of one
    particular type of computer and taking advantage of a full range of them.
    Naturally, as you broaden your range and become more diverse, the common
    factors drop, and you are left with an increasingly smaller area of common
    ground in which you can operate to accomplish a particular task. Thus, when
    you begin attacking a problem, it is important to consider under which part
    of the tradeoff curve you want to operate. Specifically, you must decide
    whether it is important that the task that you are coding have the full
    generality of being portable, or whether to just get the job done right now.
    This is the hardest choice to be made. The rest is easy, because Perl
    provides many choices, whichever way you want to approach your problem.</p>
<p class="Pp">Looking at it another way, writing portable code is usually about
    willfully limiting your available choices. Naturally, it takes discipline
    and sacrifice to do that. The product of portability and convenience may be
    a constant. You have been warned.</p>
<p class="Pp">Be aware of two important points:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Not"><a class="permalink" href="#Not">Not all Perl programs have to be
    portable</a></dt>
  <dd>There is no reason you should not use Perl as a language to glue Unix
      tools together, or to prototype a Macintosh application, or to manage the
      Windows registry. If it makes no sense to aim for portability for one
      reason or another in a given program, then don't bother.</dd>
  <dt id="Nearly"><a class="permalink" href="#Nearly">Nearly all of Perl already
    <i>is</i> portable</a></dt>
  <dd>Don't be fooled into thinking that it is hard to create portable Perl
      code. It isn't. Perl tries its level-best to bridge the gaps between
      what's available on different platforms, and all the means available to
      use those features. Thus almost all Perl code runs on any machine without
      modification. But there are some significant issues in writing portable
      code, and this document is entirely about those issues.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Here's the general rule: When you approach a task commonly done
    using a whole range of platforms, think about writing portable code. That
    way, you don't sacrifice much by way of the implementation choices you can
    avail yourself of, and at the same time you can give your users lots of
    platform choices. On the other hand, when you have to take advantage of some
    unique feature of a particular platform, as is often the case with systems
    programming (whether for Unix, Windows, VMS, etc.), consider writing
    platform-specific code.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the code will run on only two or three operating systems, you
    may need to consider only the differences of those particular systems. The
    important thing is to decide where the code will run and to be deliberate in
    your decision.</p>
<p class="Pp">The material below is separated into three main sections: main
    issues of portability (&quot;ISSUES&quot;), platform-specific issues
    (&quot;PLATFORMS&quot;), and built-in perl functions that behave differently
    on various ports (&quot;FUNCTION IMPLEMENTATIONS&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">This information should not be considered complete; it includes
    possibly transient information about idiosyncrasies of some of the ports,
    almost all of which are in a state of constant evolution. Thus, this
    material should be considered a perpetual work in progress
    (<span class="Li">&quot;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;yellow_sign.gif&quot;
    ALT=&quot;Under Construction&quot;&gt;&quot;</span>).</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Newlines"><a class="permalink" href="#Newlines">Newlines</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In most operating systems, lines in files are terminated by
    newlines. Just what is used as a newline may vary from OS to OS. Unix
    traditionally uses <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span>, one type of
    DOSish I/O uses <span class="Li">&quot;\015\012&quot;</span>, and
    Mac&#x00A0;OS uses <span class="Li">&quot;\015&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl uses <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> to represent the
    &quot;logical&quot; newline, where what is logical may depend on the
    platform in use. In MacPerl, <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> always
    means <span class="Li">&quot;\015&quot;</span>. In DOSish perls,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> usually means
    <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span>, but when accessing a file in
    &quot;text&quot; mode, perl uses the
    <span class="Li">&quot;:crlf&quot;</span> layer that translates it to (or
    from) <span class="Li">&quot;\015\012&quot;</span>, depending on whether
    you're reading or writing. Unix does the same thing on ttys in canonical
    mode. <span class="Li">&quot;\015\012&quot;</span> is commonly referred to
    as CRLF.</p>
<p class="Pp">To trim trailing newlines from text lines use <i>chomp()</i>. With
    default settings that function looks for a trailing
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> character and thus trims in a
    portable way.</p>
<p class="Pp">When dealing with binary files (or text files in binary mode) be
    sure to explicitly set $/ to the appropriate value for your file format
    before using <i>chomp()</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because of the &quot;text&quot; mode translation, DOSish perls
    have limitations in using <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span> on a file accessed in
    &quot;text&quot; mode. Stick to <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span>-ing
    to locations you got from <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span> (and no
    others), and you are usually free to use
    <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span> even in &quot;text&quot; mode.
    Using <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span> or other file operations may be
    non-portable. If you use <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> on a
    file, however, you can usually <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span> with arbitrary values in
  safety.</p>
<p class="Pp">A common misconception in socket programming is that
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> eq
    <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span> everywhere. When using protocols
    such as common Internet protocols, <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span>
    and <span class="Li">&quot;\015&quot;</span> are called for specifically,
    and the values of the logical <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\r&quot;</span> (carriage return) are not
  reliable.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    print SOCKET &quot;Hi there, client!\r\n&quot;;      # WRONG
    print SOCKET &quot;Hi there, client!\015\012&quot;;  # RIGHT
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, using <span class="Li">&quot;\015\012&quot;</span> (or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\cM\cJ&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\x0D\x0A&quot;</span>) can be tedious and unsightly,
    as well as confusing to those maintaining the code. As such, the Socket
    module supplies the Right Thing for those who want it.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
    print SOCKET &quot;Hi there, client!$CRLF&quot;      # RIGHT
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When reading from a socket, remember that the default input record
    separator <span class="Li">$/</span> is
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span>, but robust socket code will
    recognize as either <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\015\012&quot;</span> as end of line:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    while (&lt;SOCKET&gt;) {
        # ...
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Because both CRLF and LF end in LF, the input record separator can
    be set to LF and any CR stripped later. Better to write:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Socket qw(:DEFAULT :crlf);
    local($/) = LF;      # not needed if $/ is already \012

    while (&lt;SOCKET&gt;) {
        s/$CR?$LF/\n/;   # not sure if socket uses LF or CRLF, OK
    #   s/\015?\012/\n/; # same thing
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This example is preferred over the previous one--even for Unix
    platforms--because now any <span class="Li">&quot;\015&quot;</span>'s
    (<span class="Li">&quot;\cM&quot;</span>'s) are stripped out (and there was
    much rejoicing).</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, functions that return text data--such as a function
    that fetches a web page--should sometimes translate newlines before
    returning the data, if they've not yet been translated to the local newline
    representation. A single line of code will often suffice:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $data =~ s/\015?\012/\n/g;
    return $data;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Some of this may be confusing. Here's a handy reference to the
    ASCII CR and LF characters. You can print it out and stick it in your
    wallet.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    LF  eq  \012  eq  \x0A  eq  \cJ  eq  chr(10)  eq  ASCII 10
    CR  eq  \015  eq  \x0D  eq  \cM  eq  chr(13)  eq  ASCII 13

             | Unix | DOS  | Mac  |
        ---------------------------
        \n   |  LF  |  LF  |  CR  |
        \r   |  CR  |  CR  |  LF  |
        \n * |  LF  | CRLF |  CR  |
        \r * |  CR  |  CR  |  LF  |
        ---------------------------
        * text-mode STDIO
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The Unix column assumes that you are not accessing a serial line
    (like a tty) in canonical mode. If you are, then CR on input becomes
    &quot;\n&quot;, and &quot;\n&quot; on output becomes CRLF.</p>
<p class="Pp">These are just the most common definitions of
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\r&quot;</span> in Perl. There may well be others.
    For example, on an EBCDIC implementation such as z/OS (OS/390) or OS/400
    (using the ILE, the PASE is ASCII-based) the above material is similar to
    &quot;Unix&quot; but the code numbers change:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    LF  eq  \025  eq  \x15  eq  \cU  eq  chr(21)  eq  CP-1047 21
    LF  eq  \045  eq  \x25  eq           chr(37)  eq  CP-0037 37
    CR  eq  \015  eq  \x0D  eq  \cM  eq  chr(13)  eq  CP-1047 13
    CR  eq  \015  eq  \x0D  eq  \cM  eq  chr(13)  eq  CP-0037 13

             | z/OS | OS/400 |
        ----------------------
        \n   |  LF  |  LF    |
        \r   |  CR  |  CR    |
        \n * |  LF  |  LF    |
        \r * |  CR  |  CR    |
        ----------------------
        * text-mode STDIO

<h2 class="Ss" id="Numbers_endianness_and_Width"><a class="permalink" href="#Numbers_endianness_and_Width">Numbers
  endianness and Width</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Different CPUs store integers and floating point numbers in
    different orders (called <i>endianness</i>) and widths (32-bit and 64-bit
    being the most common today). This affects your programs when they attempt
    to transfer numbers in binary format from one CPU architecture to another,
    usually either &quot;live&quot; via network connection, or by storing the
    numbers to secondary storage such as a disk file or tape.</p>
<p class="Pp">Conflicting storage orders make utter mess out of the numbers. If
    a little-endian host (Intel, VAX) stores 0x12345678 (305419896 in decimal),
    a big-endian host (Motorola, Sparc, PA) reads it as 0x78563412 (2018915346
    in decimal). Alpha and MIPS can be either: Digital/Compaq used/uses them in
    little-endian mode; SGI/Cray uses them in big-endian mode. To avoid this
    problem in network (socket) connections use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span> formats
    <span class="Li">&quot;n&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;N&quot;</span>, the &quot;network&quot; orders. These
    are guaranteed to be portable.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of perl 5.10.0, you can also use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span> modifiers to force big- or
    little-endian byte-order. This is useful if you want to store signed
    integers or 64-bit integers, for example.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can explore the endianness of your platform by unpacking a
    data structure packed in native format such as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    print unpack(&quot;h*&quot;, pack(&quot;s2&quot;, 1, 2)), &quot;\n&quot;;
    # '10002000' on e.g. Intel x86 or Alpha 21064 in little-endian mode
    # '00100020' on e.g. Motorola 68040
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you need to distinguish between endian architectures you could
    use either of the variables set like so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $is_big_endian   = unpack(&quot;h*&quot;, pack(&quot;s&quot;, 1)) =~ /01/;
    $is_little_endian = unpack(&quot;h*&quot;, pack(&quot;s&quot;, 1)) =~ /^1/;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Differing widths can cause truncation even between platforms of
    equal endianness. The platform of shorter width loses the upper parts of the
    number. There is no good solution for this problem except to avoid
    transferring or storing raw binary numbers.</p>
<p class="Pp">One can circumnavigate both these problems in two ways. Either
    transfer and store numbers always in text format, instead of raw binary, or
    else consider using modules like Data::Dumper and Storable (included as of
    perl 5.8). Keeping all data as text significantly simplifies matters.</p>
<p class="Pp">The v-strings are portable only up to v2147483647 (0x7FFFFFFF),
    that's how far EBCDIC, or more precisely UTF-EBCDIC will go.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Files_and_Filesystems"><a class="permalink" href="#Files_and_Filesystems">Files
  and Filesystems</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Most platforms these days structure files in a hierarchical
    fashion. So, it is reasonably safe to assume that all platforms support the
    notion of a &quot;path&quot; to uniquely identify a file on the system. How
    that path is really written, though, differs considerably.</p>
<p class="Pp">Although similar, file path specifications differ between Unix,
    Windows, Mac&#x00A0;OS, OS/2, VMS, VOS, RISC&#x00A0;OS, and probably others.
    Unix, for example, is one of the few OSes that has the elegant idea of a
    single root directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">DOS, OS/2, VMS, VOS, and Windows can work similarly to Unix with
    <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> as path separator, or in their own
    idiosyncratic ways (such as having several root directories and various
    &quot;unrooted&quot; device files such NIL: and LPT:).</p>
<p class="Pp">Mac&#x00A0;OS 9 and earlier used
    <span class="Li">&quot;:&quot;</span> as a path separator instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The filesystem may support neither hard links
    (<span class="Li">&quot;link&quot;</span>) nor symbolic links
    (<span class="Li">&quot;symlink&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;readlink&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;lstat&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The filesystem may support neither access timestamp nor change
    timestamp (meaning that about the only portable timestamp is the
    modification timestamp), or one second granularity of any timestamps (e.g.
    the FAT filesystem limits the time granularity to two seconds).</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;inode change timestamp&quot; (the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-C&quot;</span> filetest) may really be the
    &quot;creation timestamp&quot; (which it is not in Unix).</p>
<p class="Pp">VOS perl can emulate Unix filenames with
    <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> as path separator. The native pathname
    characters greater-than, less-than, number-sign, and percent-sign are always
    accepted.</p>
<p class="Pp">RISC&#x00A0;OS perl can emulate Unix filenames with
    <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> as path separator, or go native and
    use <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> for path separator and
    <span class="Li">&quot;:&quot;</span> to signal filesystems and disk
  names.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't assume Unix filesystem access semantics: that read, write,
    and execute are all the permissions there are, and even if they exist, that
    their semantics (for example what do r, w, and x mean on a directory) are
    the Unix ones. The various Unix/POSIX compatibility layers usually try to
    make interfaces like <i>chmod()</i> work, but sometimes there simply is no
    good mapping.</p>
<p class="Pp">If all this is intimidating, have no (well, maybe only a little)
    fear. There are modules that can help. The File::Spec modules provide
    methods to do the Right Thing on whatever platform happens to be running the
    program.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use File::Spec::Functions;
    chdir(updir());        # go up one directory
    my $file = catfile(curdir(), 'temp', 'file.txt');
    # on Unix and Win32, './temp/file.txt'
    # on Mac OS Classic, ':temp:file.txt'
    # on VMS, '[.temp]file.txt'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">File::Spec is available in the standard distribution as of version
    5.004_05. File::Spec::Functions is only in File::Spec 0.7 and later, and
    some versions of perl come with version 0.6. If File::Spec is not updated to
    0.7 or later, you must use the object-oriented interface from File::Spec (or
    upgrade File::Spec).</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, production code should not have file paths hardcoded.
    Making them user-supplied or read from a configuration file is better,
    keeping in mind that file path syntax varies on different machines.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is especially noticeable in scripts like Makefiles and test
    suites, which often assume <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> as a path
    separator for subdirectories.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also of use is File::Basename from the standard distribution,
    which splits a pathname into pieces (base filename, full path to directory,
    and file suffix).</p>
<p class="Pp">Even when on a single platform (if you can call Unix a single
    platform), remember not to count on the existence or the contents of
    particular system-specific files or directories, like <i>/etc/passwd</i>,
    <i>/etc/sendmail.conf</i>, <i>/etc/resolv.conf</i>, or even <i>/tmp/</i>.
    For example, <i>/etc/passwd</i> may exist but not contain the encrypted
    passwords, because the system is using some form of enhanced security. Or it
    may not contain all the accounts, because the system is using NIS. If code
    does need to rely on such a file, include a description of the file and its
    format in the code's documentation, then make it easy for the user to
    override the default location of the file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't assume a text file will end with a newline. They should, but
    people forget.</p>
<p class="Pp">Do not have two files or directories of the same name with
    different case, like <i>test.pl</i> and <i>Test.pl</i>, as many platforms
    have case-insensitive (or at least case-forgiving) filenames. Also, try not
    to have non-word characters (except for
    <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>) in the names, and keep them to the
    8.3 convention, for maximum portability, onerous a burden though this may
    appear.</p>
<p class="Pp">Likewise, when using the AutoSplit module, try to keep your
    functions to 8.3 naming and case-insensitive conventions; or, at the least,
    make it so the resulting files have a unique (case-insensitively) first 8
    characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whitespace in filenames is tolerated on most systems, but not all,
    and even on systems where it might be tolerated, some utilities might become
    confused by such whitespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many systems (DOS, VMS ODS-2) cannot have more than one
    <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> in their filenames.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't assume <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> won't be the
    first character of a filename. Always use
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span> explicitly to open a file for
    reading, or even better, use the three-arg version of open, unless you want
    the user to be able to specify a pipe open.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    open my $fh, '&lt;', $existing_file) or die $!;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If filenames might use strange characters, it is safest to open it
    with <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>.
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> is magic and can translate
    characters like <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>, which may be the wrong thing to do.
    (Sometimes, though, it's the right thing.) Three-arg open can also help
    protect against this translation in cases where it is undesirable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't use <span class="Li">&quot;:&quot;</span> as a part of a
    filename since many systems use that for their own semantics (Mac OS Classic
    for separating pathname components, many networking schemes and utilities
    for separating the nodename and the pathname, and so on). For the same
    reasons, avoid <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;;&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't assume that in pathnames you can collapse two leading
    slashes <span class="Li">&quot;//&quot;</span> into one: some networking and
    clustering filesystems have special semantics for that. Let the operating
    system to sort it out.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>portable filename characters</i> as defined by ANSI C
  are</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
 a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r t u v w x y z
 A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R T U V W X Y Z
 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 . _ -
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and the &quot;-&quot; shouldn't be the first character. If you
    want to be hypercorrect, stay case-insensitive and within the 8.3 naming

  Interaction</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Not all platforms provide a command line. These are usually
    platforms that rely primarily on a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user
    interaction. A program requiring a command line interface might not work
    everywhere. This is probably for the user of the program to deal with, so
    don't stay up late worrying about it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some platforms can't delete or rename files held open by the
    system, this limitation may also apply to changing filesystem
    metainformation like file permissions or owners. Remember to
    <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span> files when you are done with them.
    Don't <span class="Li">&quot;unlink&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;rename&quot;</span> an open file. Don't
    <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> a file already tied or opened;
    <span class="Li">&quot;untie&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span> it first.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't open the same file more than once at a time for writing, as
    some operating systems put mandatory locks on such files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't assume that write/modify permission on a directory gives the
    right to add or delete files/directories in that directory. That is
    filesystem specific: in some filesystems you need write/modify permission
    also (or even just) in the file/directory itself. In some filesystems (AFS,
    DFS) the permission to add/delete directory entries is a completely separate
    permission.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't assume that a single
    <span class="Li">&quot;unlink&quot;</span> completely gets rid of the file:
    some filesystems (most notably the ones in VMS) have versioned filesystems,
    and <i>unlink()</i> removes only the most recent one (it doesn't remove all
    the versions because by default the native tools on those platforms remove
    just the most recent version, too). The portable idiom to remove all the
    versions of a file is</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    1 while unlink &quot;file&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will terminate if the file is undeleteable for some reason
    (protected, not there, and so on).</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't count on a specific environment variable existing in
    <span class="Li">%ENV</span>. Don't count on <span class="Li">%ENV</span>
    entries being case-sensitive, or even case-preserving. Don't try to clear
    <span class="Li">%ENV</span> by saying <span class="Li">&quot;%ENV =
    ();&quot;</span>, or, if you really have to, make it conditional on
    <span class="Li">&quot;$^O ne 'VMS'&quot;</span> since in VMS the
    <span class="Li">%ENV</span> table is much more than a per-process key-value
    string table.</p>
<p class="Pp">On VMS, some entries in the <span class="Li">%ENV</span> hash are
    dynamically created when their key is used on a read if they did not
    previously exist. The values for <span class="Li">$ENV{HOME}</span>,
    <span class="Li">$ENV{TERM}</span>, <span class="Li">$ENV{HOME}</span>, and
    <span class="Li">$ENV{USER}</span>, are known to be dynamically generated.
    The specific names that are dynamically generated may vary with the version
    of the C library on VMS, and more may exist than is documented.</p>
<p class="Pp">On VMS by default, changes to the <span class="Li">%ENV</span>
    hash are persistent after the process exits. This can cause unintended
    issues.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't count on signals or <span class="Li">%SIG</span> for
    anything.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't count on filename globbing. Use
    <span class="Li">&quot;opendir&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;readdir&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;closedir&quot;</span> instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't count on per-program environment variables, or per-program
    current directories.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't count on specific values of <span class="Li">$!</span>,
    neither numeric nor especially the strings values. Users may switch their
    locales causing error messages to be translated into their languages. If you
    can trust a POSIXish environment, you can portably use the symbols defined
    by the Errno module, like ENOENT. And don't trust on the values of
    <span class="Li">$!</span> at all except immediately after a failed system

<p class="Pp">Don't assume that the name used to invoke a command or program
    with <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> can also be used to test for the
    existence of the file that holds the executable code for that command or
    program. First, many systems have &quot;internal&quot; commands that are
    built-in to the shell or OS and while these commands can be invoked, there
    is no corresponding file. Second, some operating systems (e.g., Cygwin,
    DJGPP, OS/2, and VOS) have required suffixes for executable files; these
    suffixes are generally permitted on the command name but are not required.
    Thus, a command like &quot;perl&quot; might exist in a file named
    &quot;perl&quot;, &quot;perl.exe&quot;, or &quot;perl.pm&quot;, depending on
    the operating system. The variable &quot;_exe&quot; in the Config module
    holds the executable suffix, if any. Third, the VMS port carefully sets up
    $^X and <span class="Li">$Config</span>{perlpath} so that no further
    processing is required. This is just as well, because the matching regular
    expression used below would then have to deal with a possible trailing
    version number in the VMS file name.</p>

    makes being a perl hacker worth being.</p>
<p class="Pp">Commands that launch external processes are generally supported on
    most platforms (though many of them do not support any type of forking). The
    problem with using them arises from what you invoke them on. External tools
    are often named differently on different platforms, may not be available in
    the same location, might accept different arguments, can behave differently,
    and often present their results in a platform-dependent way. Thus, you
    should seldom depend on them to produce consistent results. (Then again, if
    you're calling <i>netstat -a</i>, you probably don't expect it to run on
    both Unix and CP/M.)</p>
<p class="Pp">One especially common bit of Perl code is opening a pipe to
    <b>sendmail</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    open(MAIL, '|/usr/lib/sendmail -t') 
        or die &quot;cannot fork sendmail: $!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is fine for systems programming when sendmail is known to be
    available. But it is not fine for many non-Unix systems, and even some Unix
    systems that may not have sendmail installed. If a portable solution is
    needed, see the various distributions on CPAN that deal with it.
    Mail::Mailer and Mail::Send in the MailTools distribution are commonly used,
    and provide several mailing methods, including mail, sendmail, and direct
    SMTP (via Net::SMTP) if a mail transfer agent is not available.
    Mail::Sendmail is a standalone module that provides simple,
    platform-independent mailing.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Unix System V IPC (<span class="Li">&quot;msg*(), sem*(),

<p class="Pp">Do not use either the bare result of

    bare v-strings (such as <span class="Li">&quot;v10.20.30.40&quot;</span>) to
    represent IPv4 addresses: both forms just pack the four bytes into network
    order. That this would be equal to the C language
    <span class="Li">&quot;in_addr&quot;</span> struct (which is what the socket
    code internally uses) is not guaranteed. To be portable use the routines of
    the Socket extension, such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;inet_aton()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;inet_ntoa()&quot;</span>, and

<p class="Pp">XS code can usually be made to work with any platform, but
    dependent libraries, header files, etc., might not be readily available or
    portable, or the XS code itself might be platform-specific, just as Perl
    code might be. If the libraries and headers are portable, then it is
    normally reasonable to make sure the XS code is portable, too.</p>
<p class="Pp">A different type of portability issue arises when writing XS code:
    availability of a C compiler on the end-user's system. C brings with it its
    own portability issues, and writing XS code will expose you to some of
    those. Writing purely in Perl is an easier way to achieve portability.</p>

<p class="Pp">There is no one DBM module available on all platforms. SDBM_File
    and the others are generally available on all Unix and DOSish ports, but not
    in MacPerl, where only NBDM_File and DB_File are available.</p>
<p class="Pp">The good news is that at least some DBM module should be
    available, and AnyDBM_File will use whichever module it can find. Of course,
    then the code needs to be fairly strict, dropping to the greatest common
    factor (e.g., not exceeding 1K for each record), so that it will work with
    any DBM module. See AnyDBM_File for more details.</p>

<p class="Pp">The system's notion of time of day and calendar date is controlled
    in widely different ways. Don't assume the timezone is stored in
    <span class="Li">$ENV{TZ}</span>, and even if it is, don't assume that you
    can control the timezone through that variable. Don't assume anything about
    the three-letter timezone abbreviations (for example that MST would be the
    Mountain Standard Time, it's been known to stand for Moscow Standard Time).
    If you need to use timezones, express them in some unambiguous format like
    the exact number of minutes offset from UTC, or the POSIX timezone
  format.</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't assume that the epoch starts at 00:00:00, January 1, 1970,
    because that is OS- and implementation-specific. It is better to store a
    date in an unambiguous representation. The ISO 8601 standard defines
    YYYY-MM-DD as the date format, or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS (that's a literal
    &quot;T&quot; separating the date from the time). Please do use the ISO 8601
    instead of making us guess what date 02/03/04 might be. ISO 8601 even sorts
    nicely as-is. A text representation (like &quot;1987-12-18&quot;) can be
    easily converted into an OS-specific value using a module like Date::Parse.
    An array of values, such as those returned by
    <span class="Li">&quot;localtime&quot;</span>, can be converted to an
    OS-specific representation using Time::Local.</p>
<p class="Pp">When calculating specific times, such as for tests in time or date
    modules, it may be appropriate to calculate an offset for the epoch.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    require Time::Local;
    my $offset = Time::Local::timegm(0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 70);

<p class="Pp">The value for <span class="Li">$offset</span> in Unix will be
    <span class="Li">0</span>, but in Mac OS Classic will be some large number.
    <span class="Li">$offset</span> can then be added to a Unix time value to

<p class="Pp">If you may assume POSIX (a rather large assumption), you may read
    more about the POSIX locale system from perllocale. The locale system at
    least attempts to make things a little bit more portable, or at least more
    convenient and native-friendly for non-English users. The system affects
    character sets and encoding, and date and time formatting--amongst other
    things.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you really want to be international, you should consider
    Unicode. See perluniintro and perlunicode for more information.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to use non-ASCII bytes (outside the bytes 0x00..0x7f)
    in the &quot;source code&quot; of your code, to be portable you have to be
    explicit about what bytes they are. Someone might for example be using your
    code under a UTF-8 locale, in which case random native bytes might be
    illegal (&quot;Malformed UTF-8 ...&quot;) This means that for example
    embedding ISO 8859-1 bytes beyond 0x7f into your strings might cause trouble
    later. If the bytes are native 8-bit bytes, you can use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;bytes&quot;</span> pragma. If the bytes are in a
    string (regular expression being a curious string), you can often also use
    the <span class="Li">&quot;\xHH&quot;</span> notation instead of embedding

<p class="Pp">The last two constructs may appear unintuitive to most people. The

<p class="Pp">Most multi-user platforms provide basic levels of security,
    usually implemented at the filesystem level. Some, however, unfortunately do
    not. Thus the notion of user id, or &quot;home&quot; directory, or even the
    state of being logged-in, may be unrecognizable on many platforms. If you
    write programs that are security-conscious, it is usually best to know what
    type of system you will be running under so that you can write code
    explicitly for that platform (or class of platforms).</p>
<p class="Pp">Don't assume the Unix filesystem access semantics: the operating
    system or the filesystem may be using some ACL systems, which are richer
    languages than the usual rwx. Even if the rwx exist, their semantics might
    be different.</p>
<p class="Pp">(From security viewpoint testing for permissions before attempting

<p class="Pp">Be careful in the tests you supply with your module or programs.
    Module code may be fully portable, but its tests might not be. This often
    happens when tests spawn off other processes or call external programs to
    aid in the testing, or when (as noted above) the tests assume certain things
    about the filesystem and paths. Be careful not to depend on a specific
    output style for errors, such as when checking <span class="Li">$!</span>
    after a failed system call. Using <span class="Li">$!</span> for anything
    else than displaying it as output is doubtful (though see the Errno module
    for testing reasonably portably for error value). Some platforms expect a

<h2 class="Ss">DOS and Derivatives</h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl has long been ported to Intel-style microcomputers running
    under systems like PC-DOS, MS-DOS, OS/2, and most Windows platforms you can
    bring yourself to mention (except for Windows CE, if you count that). Users
    familiar with <i>COMMAND.COM</i> or <i>CMD.EXE</i> style shells should be
    aware that each of these file specifications may have subtle
  differences:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    my $filespec0 = &quot;c:/foo/bar/file.txt&quot;;
    my $filespec1 = &quot;c:\\foo\\bar\\file.txt&quot;;
    my $filespec2 = 'c:\foo\bar\file.txt';
    my $filespec3 = 'c:\\foo\\bar\\file.txt';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">System calls accept either <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span>
    or <span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span> as the path separator. However,
    many command-line utilities of DOS vintage treat
    <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> as the option prefix, so may get
    confused by filenames containing <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span>.
    Aside from calling any external programs,
    <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> will work just fine, and probably
    better, as it is more consistent with popular usage, and avoids the problem
    of remembering what to backwhack and what not to.</p>
<p class="Pp">The DOS FAT filesystem can accommodate only &quot;8.3&quot; style
    filenames. Under the &quot;case-insensitive, but case-preserving&quot; HPFS
    (OS/2) and NTFS (NT) filesystems you may have to be careful about case
    returned with functions like <span class="Li">&quot;readdir&quot;</span> or
    used with functions like <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;opendir&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">DOS also treats several filenames as special, such as AUX, PRN,
    NUL, CON, COM1, LPT1, LPT2, etc. Unfortunately, sometimes these filenames
    won't even work if you include an explicit directory prefix. It is best to
    avoid such filenames, if you want your code to be portable to DOS and its
    derivatives. It's hard to know what these all are, unfortunately.</p>
<p class="Pp">Users of these operating systems may also wish to make use of
    scripts such as <i>pl2bat.bat</i> or <i>pl2cmd</i> to put wrappers around
    your scripts.</p>
<p class="Pp">Newline (<span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span>) is translated as
    <span class="Li">&quot;\015\012&quot;</span> by STDIO when reading from and
    writing to files (see &quot;Newlines&quot;).
    <span class="Li">&quot;binmode(FILEHANDLE)&quot;</span> will keep
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> translated as
    <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span> for that filehandle. Since it is a
    no-op on other systems, <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> should
    be used for cross-platform code that deals with binary data. That's assuming
    you realize in advance that your data is in binary. General-purpose programs
    should often assume nothing about their data.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$^O</span> variable and the
    <span class="Li">$Config{archname}</span> values for various DOSish perls
    are as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<h2 class="Ss">VMS</h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl on VMS is discussed in perlvms in the perl distribution.</p>
<p class="Pp">The official name of VMS as of this writing is OpenVMS.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl on VMS can accept either VMS- or Unix-style file
    specifications as in either of the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $ perl -ne &quot;print if /perl_setup/i&quot; SYS$LOGIN:LOGIN.COM
    $ perl -ne &quot;print if /perl_setup/i&quot; /sys$login/login.com
</pre>
<p class="Pp">but not a mixture of both as in:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $ perl -ne &quot;print if /perl_setup/i&quot; sys$login:/login.com
    Can't open sys$login:/login.com: file specification syntax error
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Interacting with Perl from the Digital Command Language (DCL)
    shell often requires a different set of quotation marks than Unix shells do.
    For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $ perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello, world.\n&quot;&quot;&quot;
    Hello, world.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There are several ways to wrap your perl scripts in DCL
    <i>.COM</i> files, if you are so inclined. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $ write sys$output &quot;Hello from DCL!&quot;
    $ if p1 .eqs. &quot;&quot;
    $ then perl -x 'f$environment(&quot;PROCEDURE&quot;)
    $ else perl -x - 'p1 'p2 'p3 'p4 'p5 'p6 'p7 'p8
    $ deck/dollars=&quot;__END__&quot;
    #!/usr/bin/perl

    print &quot;Hello from Perl!\n&quot;;

    __END__
    $ endif
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Do take care with <span class="Li">&quot;$ ASSIGN/nolog/user
    SYS$COMMAND: SYS$INPUT&quot;</span> if your perl-in-DCL script expects to do
    things like <span class="Li">&quot;$read = &lt;STDIN&gt;;&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The VMS operating system has two filesystems, known as ODS-2 and
    ODS-5.</p>
<p class="Pp">For ODS-2, filenames are in the format
    &quot;name.extension;version&quot;. The maximum length for filenames is 39
    characters, and the maximum length for extensions is also 39 characters.
    Version is a number from 1 to 32767. Valid characters are
    <span class="Li">&quot;/[A-Z0-9$_-]/&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The ODS-2 filesystem is case-insensitive and does not preserve
    case. Perl simulates this by converting all filenames to lowercase
    internally.</p>
<p class="Pp">For ODS-5, filenames may have almost any character in them and can
    include Unicode characters. Characters that could be misinterpreted by the
    DCL shell or file parsing utilities need to be prefixed with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span> character, or replaced with
    hexadecimal characters prefixed with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span> character. Such prefixing is only
    needed with the pathnames are in VMS format in applications. Programs that
    can accept the Unix format of pathnames do not need the escape characters.
    The maximum length for filenames is 255 characters. The ODS-5 file system
    can handle both a case preserved and a case sensitive mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">ODS-5 is only available on the OpenVMS for 64 bit platforms.</p>
<p class="Pp">Support for the extended file specifications is being done as
    optional settings to preserve backward compatibility with Perl scripts that
    assume the previous VMS limitations.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general routines on VMS that get a Unix format file
    specification should return it in a Unix format, and when they get a VMS
    format specification they should return a VMS format unless they are
    documented to do a conversion.</p>
<p class="Pp">For routines that generate return a file specification, VMS allows
    setting if the C library which Perl is built on if it will be returned in
    VMS format or in Unix format.</p>
<p class="Pp">With the ODS-2 file system, there is not much difference in syntax
    of filenames without paths for VMS or Unix. With the extended character set
    available with ODS-5 there can be a significant difference.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because of this, existing Perl scripts written for VMS were
    sometimes treating VMS and Unix filenames interchangeably. Without the
    extended character set enabled, this behavior will mostly be maintained for
    backwards compatibility.</p>
<p class="Pp">When extended characters are enabled with ODS-5, the handling of
    Unix formatted file specifications is to that of a Unix system.</p>
<p class="Pp">VMS file specifications without extensions have a trailing dot. An
    equivalent Unix file specification should not show the trailing dot.</p>
<p class="Pp">The result of all of this, is that for VMS, for portable scripts,
    you can not depend on Perl to present the filenames in lowercase, to be case
    sensitive, and that the filenames could be returned in either Unix or VMS
    format.</p>
<p class="Pp">And if a routine returns a file specification, unless it is
    intended to convert it, it should return it in the same format as it found
    it.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;readdir&quot;</span> by default has
    traditionally returned lowercased filenames. When the ODS-5 support is
    enabled, it will return the exact case of the filename on the disk.</p>
<p class="Pp">Files without extensions have a trailing period on them, so doing
    a <span class="Li">&quot;readdir&quot;</span> in the default mode with a
    file named <i>A.;5</i> will return <i>a.</i> when VMS is (though that file
    could be opened with <span class="Li">&quot;open(FH, 'A')&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">With support for extended file specifications and if
    <span class="Li">&quot;opendir&quot;</span> was given a Unix format
    directory, a file named <i>A.;5</i> will return <i>a</i> and optionally in
    the exact case on the disk. When <span class="Li">&quot;opendir&quot;</span>
    is given a VMS format directory, then
    <span class="Li">&quot;readdir&quot;</span> should return <i>a.</i>, and
    again with the optionally the exact case.</p>
<p class="Pp">RMS had an eight level limit on directory depths from any rooted
    logical (allowing 16 levels overall) prior to VMS 7.2, and even with
    versions of VMS on VAX up through 7.3. Hence
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8]&quot;</span> is a valid
    directory specification but
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_ROOT:[LIB.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9]&quot;</span> is not.
    <i>Makefile.PL</i> authors might have to take this into account, but at
    least they can refer to the former as
    <span class="Li">&quot;/PERL_ROOT/lib/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Pumpkings and module integrators can easily see whether files with
    too many directory levels have snuck into the core by running the following
    in the top-level source directory:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
 $ perl -ne &quot;$_=~s/\s+.*//; print if scalar(split /\//) &gt; 8;&quot; &lt; MANIFEST
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The VMS::Filespec module, which gets installed as part of the
    build process on VMS, is a pure Perl module that can easily be installed on
    non-VMS platforms and can be helpful for conversions to and from RMS native
    formats. It is also now the only way that you should check to see if VMS is
    in a case sensitive mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">What <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> represents depends on
    the type of file opened. It usually represents
    <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span> but it could also be
    <span class="Li">&quot;\015&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\015\012&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\000&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\040&quot;</span>, or nothing depending on the file
    organization and record format. The VMS::Stdio module provides access to the
    special <i>fopen()</i> requirements of files with unusual attributes on
  VMS.</p>
<p class="Pp">TCP/IP stacks are optional on VMS, so socket routines might not be
    implemented. UDP sockets may not be supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">The TCP/IP library support for all current versions of VMS is
    dynamically loaded if present, so even if the routines are configured, they
    may return a status indicating that they are not implemented.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of <span class="Li">$^O</span> on OpenVMS is
    &quot;VMS&quot;. To determine the architecture that you are running on
    without resorting to loading all of <span class="Li">%Config</span> you can
    examine the content of the <span class="Li">@INC</span> array like so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    if (grep(/VMS_AXP/, @INC)) {
        print &quot;I'm on Alpha!\n&quot;;

    } elsif (grep(/VMS_VAX/, @INC)) {
        print &quot;I'm on VAX!\n&quot;;

    } elsif (grep(/VMS_IA64/, @INC)) {
        print &quot;I'm on IA64!\n&quot;;

    } else {
        print &quot;I'm not so sure about where $^O is...\n&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In general, the significant differences should only be if Perl is
    running on VMS_VAX or one of the 64 bit OpenVMS platforms.</p>
<p class="Pp">On VMS, perl determines the UTC offset from the
    <span class="Li">&quot;SYS$TIMEZONE_DIFFERENTIAL&quot;</span> logical name.
    Although the VMS epoch began at 17-NOV-1858 00:00:00.00, calls to
    <span class="Li">&quot;localtime&quot;</span> are adjusted to count offsets
    from 01-JAN-1970 00:00:00.00, just like Unix.</p>

<h2 class="Ss">VOS</h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl on VOS (also known as OpenVOS) is discussed in
    <i>README.vos</i> in the perl distribution (installed as perlvos). Perl on
    VOS can accept either VOS- or Unix-style file specifications as in either of
    the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $ perl -ne &quot;print if /perl_setup/i&quot; &gt;system&gt;notices
    $ perl -ne &quot;print if /perl_setup/i&quot; /system/notices
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or even a mixture of both as in:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $ perl -ne &quot;print if /perl_setup/i&quot; &gt;system/notices
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Even though VOS allows the slash character to appear in object
    names, because the VOS port of Perl interprets it as a pathname delimiting
    character, VOS files, directories, or links whose names contain a slash
    character cannot be processed. Such files must be renamed before they can be
    processed by Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Older releases of VOS (prior to OpenVOS Release 17.0) limit file
    names to 32 or fewer characters, prohibit file names from starting with a
    <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span> character, and prohibit file names
    from containing any character matching <span class="Li">&quot;tr/
    !#%&amp;'()*;&lt;=&gt;?//&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Newer releases of VOS (OpenVOS Release 17.0 or later) support a
    feature known as extended names. On these releases, file names can contain
    up to 255 characters, are prohibited from starting with a
    <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span> character, and the set of prohibited
    characters is reduced to any character matching
    <span class="Li">&quot;tr/#%*&lt;&gt;?//&quot;</span>. There are
    restrictions involving spaces and apostrophes: these characters must not
    begin or end a name, nor can they immediately precede or follow a period.
    Additionally, a space must not immediately precede another space or hyphen.
    Specifically, the following character combinations are prohibited:
    space-space, space-hyphen, period-space, space-period, period-apostrophe,
    apostrophe-period, leading or trailing space, and leading or trailing
    apostrophe. Although an extended file name is limited to 255 characters, a
    path name is still limited to 256 characters.</p>

<h2 class="Ss">EBCDIC Platforms</h2>
<p class="Pp">Recent versions of Perl have been ported to platforms such as
    OS/400 on AS/400 minicomputers as well as OS/390, VM/ESA, and BS2000 for
    S/390 Mainframes. Such computers use EBCDIC character sets internally
    (usually Character Code Set ID 0037 for OS/400 and either 1047 or POSIX-BC
    for S/390 systems). On the mainframe perl currently works under the
    &quot;Unix system services for OS/390&quot; (formerly known as OpenEdition),
    VM/ESA OpenEdition, or the BS200 POSIX-BC system (BS2000 is supported in
    perl 5.6 and greater). See perlos390 for details. Note that for OS/400 there
    is also a port of Perl 5.8.1/5.10.0 or later to the PASE which is
    ASCII-based (as opposed to ILE which is EBCDIC-based), see perlos400.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of R2.5 of USS for OS/390 and Version 2.3 of VM/ESA these Unix
    sub-systems do not support the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span>
    shebang trick for script invocation. Hence, on OS/390 and VM/ESA perl
    scripts can be executed with a header similar to the following simple
    script:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    : # use perl
        eval 'exec /usr/local/bin/perl -S $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
            if 0;
    #!/usr/local/bin/perl     # just a comment really

    print &quot;Hello from perl!\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">OS/390 will support the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span>
    shebang trick in release 2.8 and beyond. Calls to
    <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> and backticks can use POSIX shell
    syntax on all S/390 systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the AS/400, if PERL5 is in your library list, you may need to
    wrap your perl scripts in a CL procedure to invoke them like so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    BEGIN
      CALL PGM(PERL5/PERL) PARM('/QOpenSys/hello.pl')
    ENDPGM
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will invoke the perl script <i>hello.pl</i> in the root of
    the QOpenSys file system. On the AS/400 calls to
    <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> or backticks must use CL
  syntax.</p>
<p class="Pp">On these platforms, bear in mind that the EBCDIC character set may
    have an effect on what happens with some perl functions (such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;chr&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;ord&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span>), as well as bit-fiddling with
    ASCII constants using operators like <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>, not to mention dealing with socket
    interfaces to ASCII computers (see &quot;Newlines&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">Fortunately, most web servers for the mainframe will correctly
    translate the <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> in the following
    statement to its ASCII equivalent (<span class="Li">&quot;\r&quot;</span> is
    the same under both Unix and OS/390):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    print &quot;Content-type: text/html\r\n\r\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The values of <span class="Li">$^O</span> on some of these
    platforms includes:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    uname         $^O        $Config{'archname'}
    --------------------------------------------
    OS/390        os390      os390

    POSIX-BC      posix-bc   BS2000-posix-bc
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Some simple tricks for determining if you are running on an EBCDIC
    platform could include any of the following (perhaps all):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    if (&quot;\t&quot; eq &quot;\005&quot;)   { print &quot;EBCDIC may be spoken here!\n&quot;; }

    if (ord('A') == 193) { print &quot;EBCDIC may be spoken here!\n&quot;; }

    if (chr(169) eq 'z') { print &quot;EBCDIC may be spoken here!\n&quot;; }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">One thing you may not want to rely on is the EBCDIC encoding of
    punctuation characters since these may differ from code page to code page
    (and once your module or script is rumoured to work with EBCDIC, folks will
    want it to work with all EBCDIC character sets).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Acorn_"><a class="permalink" href="#Acorn_">Acorn RISC
  OS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Because Acorns use ASCII with newlines
    (<span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span>) in text files as
    <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span> like Unix, and because Unix
    filename emulation is turned on by default, most simple scripts will
    probably work &quot;out of the box&quot;. The native filesystem is modular,
    and individual filesystems are free to be case-sensitive or insensitive, and
    are usually case-preserving. Some native filesystems have name length
    limits, which file and directory names are silently truncated to fit.
    Scripts should be aware that the standard filesystem currently has a name
    length limit of <b>10</b> characters, with up to 77 items in a directory,
    but other filesystems may not impose such limitations.</p>
<p class="Pp">Native filenames are of the form</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    Filesystem#Special_Field::DiskName.$.Directory.Directory.File
</pre>
<p class="Pp">where</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    Special_Field is not usually present, but may contain . and $ .
    Filesystem =~ m|[A-Za-z0-9_]|
    DsicName   =~ m|[A-Za-z0-9_/]|
    $ represents the root directory
    . is the path separator
    @ is the current directory (per filesystem but machine global)
    ^ is the parent directory
    Directory and File =~ m|[^\0- &quot;\.\$\%\&amp;:\@\\^\|\177]+|
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The default filename translation is roughly
    <span class="Li">&quot;tr|/.|./|;&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Pp">Note that <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;ADFS::HardDisk.$.File&quot;
    ne 'ADFS::HardDisk.$.File'&quot;</span> and that the second stage of
    <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> interpolation in regular expressions
    will fall foul of the <span class="Li">$.</span> if scripts are not
  careful.</p>
<p class="Pp">Logical paths specified by system variables containing
    comma-separated search lists are also allowed; hence
    <span class="Li">&quot;System:Modules&quot;</span> is a valid filename, and
    the filesystem will prefix <span class="Li">&quot;Modules&quot;</span> with
    each section of <span class="Li">&quot;System$Path&quot;</span> until a name
    is made that points to an object on disk. Writing to a new file
    <span class="Li">&quot;System:Modules&quot;</span> would be allowed only if
    <span class="Li">&quot;System$Path&quot;</span> contains a single item list.
    The filesystem will also expand system variables in filenames if enclosed in
    angle brackets, so
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;System$Dir&gt;.Modules&quot;</span> would look
    for the file
    <span class="Li">&quot;$ENV{'System$Dir'}&#x00A0;.&#x00A0;'Modules'&quot;</span>.
    The obvious implication of this is that <b>fully qualified filenames can
    start with </b><b>&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</b><b></b> and should be protected
    when <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> is used for input.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> was in use as a
    directory separator and filenames could not be assumed to be unique after 10
    characters, Acorn implemented the C compiler to strip the trailing
    <span class="Li">&quot;.c&quot;</span>
    <span class="Li">&quot;.h&quot;</span>
    <span class="Li">&quot;.s&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;.o&quot;</span> suffix from filenames specified in
    source code and store the respective files in subdirectories named after the
    suffix. Hence files are translated:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    foo.h           h.foo
    C:foo.h         C:h.foo        (logical path variable)
    sys/os.h        sys.h.os       (C compiler groks Unix-speak)
    10charname.c    c.10charname
    10charname.o    o.10charname
    11charname_.c   c.11charname   (assuming filesystem truncates at 10)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The Unix emulation library's translation of filenames to native
    assumes that this sort of translation is required, and it allows a
    user-defined list of known suffixes that it will transpose in this fashion.
    This may seem transparent, but consider that with these rules
    <i>foo/bar/baz.h</i> and <i>foo/bar/h/baz</i> both map to
    <i>foo.bar.h.baz</i>, and that <span class="Li">&quot;readdir&quot;</span>
    and <span class="Li">&quot;glob&quot;</span> cannot and do not attempt to
    emulate the reverse mapping. Other <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>'s
    in filenames are translated to <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">As implied above, the environment accessed through
    <span class="Li">%ENV</span> is global, and the convention is that program
    specific environment variables are of the form
    <span class="Li">&quot;Program$Name&quot;</span>. Each filesystem maintains
    a current directory, and the current filesystem's current directory is the
    <b>global</b> current directory. Consequently, sociable programs don't
    change the current directory but rely on full pathnames, and programs (and
    Makefiles) cannot assume that they can spawn a child process which can
    change the current directory without affecting its parent (and everyone else
    for that matter).</p>
<p class="Pp">Because native operating system filehandles are global and are
    currently allocated down from 255, with 0 being a reserved value, the Unix
    emulation library emulates Unix filehandles. Consequently, you can't rely on
    passing <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;STDERR&quot;</span> to your children.</p>
<p class="Pp">The desire of users to express filenames of the form
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;Foo$Dir&gt;.Bar&quot;</span> on the command line
    unquoted causes problems, too: <span class="Li">&quot;``&quot;</span>
    command output capture has to perform a guessing game. It assumes that a
    string <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;[^&lt;&gt;]+\$[^&lt;&gt;]&gt;&quot;</span>
    is a reference to an environment variable, whereas anything else involving
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> is redirection, and generally
    manages to be 99% right. Of course, the problem remains that scripts cannot
    rely on any Unix tools being available, or that any tools found have
    Unix-like command line arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">Extensions and XS are, in theory, buildable by anyone using free
    tools. In practice, many don't, as users of the Acorn platform are used to
    binary distributions. MakeMaker does run, but no available make currently
    copes with MakeMaker's makefiles; even if and when this should be fixed, the
    lack of a Unix-like shell will cause problems with makefile rules,
    especially lines of the form <span class="Li">&quot;cd</span>
    <span class="Li">sdbm &amp;&amp; make all&quot;</span>, and anything using
    quoting.</p>
<p class="Pp">&quot;RISC&#x00A0;OS&quot; is the proper name for the operating
    system, but the value in <span class="Li">$^O</span> is &quot;riscos&quot;
    (because we don't like shouting).</p>

      When the POSIX_EXIT mode is enabled, a generic number will be encoded in a

  Platforms (Perl 5.8)</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">As of July 2002 (the Perl release 5.8.0), the following platforms
    were able to build Perl from the standard source code distribution available
    at &lt;http://www.cpan.org/src/&gt;</p>

        1) in DOS mode either the DOS or OS/2 ports can be used
        2) compilers: Borland, MinGW (GCC), VC6
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The following platforms worked with the previous releases (5.6 and
    5.7), but we did not manage either to fix or to test these in time for the
    5.8.0 release. There is a very good chance that many of these will work fine
    with the 5.8.0.</p>

<p class="Pp">The following platforms have been known to build Perl from source
    in the past (5.005_03 and earlier), but we haven't been able to verify their
    status for the current release, either because the hardware/software
    platforms are rare or because we don't have an active champion on these
    platforms--or both. They used to work, though, so go ahead and try compiling
    them, and let perlbug@perl.org of any trouble.</p>
