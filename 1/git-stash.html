<p class="Pp">Use <b>git stash</b> when you want to record the current state of
    the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working
    directory. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the
    working directory to match the <b>HEAD</b> commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">The modifications stashed away by this command can be listed with
    <b>git stash list</b>, inspected with <b>git stash show</b>, and restored
    (potentially on top of a different commit) with <b>git stash apply</b>.
    Calling <b>git stash</b> without any arguments is equivalent to <b>git stash
    push</b>. A stash is by default listed as &quot;WIP on <i>branchname</i>
    ...&quot;, but you can give a more descriptive message on the command line
    when you create one.</p>
<p class="Pp">The latest stash you created is stored in <b>refs/stash</b>; older
    stashes are found in the reflog of this reference and can be named using the
    usual reflog syntax (e.g. <b>stash@{0}</b> is the most recently created
    stash, <b>stash@{1}</b> is the one before it, <b>stash@{2.hours.ago}</b> is
    also possible). Stashes may also be referenced by specifying just the stash
    index (e.g. the integer <b>n</b> is equivalent to <b>stash@{n}</b>).</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMANDS">COMMANDS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">push [-p|--patch] [-S|--staged] [-k|--[no-]keep-index]
    [-u|--include-untracked] [-a|--all] [-q|--quiet] [(-m|--message)
    &lt;message&gt;] [--pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt; [--pathspec-file-nul]]
    [--] [&lt;pathspec&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Save your local modifications to a new <i>stash entry</i>
  and roll them back to HEAD (in the working tree and in the index). The
  &lt;message&gt; part is optional and gives the description along with the
  stashed state.
<p class="Pp">For quickly making a snapshot, you can omit &quot;push&quot;. In
    this mode, non-option arguments are not allowed to prevent a misspelled
    subcommand from making an unwanted stash entry. The two exceptions to this
    are <b>stash -p</b> which acts as alias for <b>stash push -p</b> and
    pathspec elements, which are allowed after a double hyphen <b>--</b> for
    disambiguation.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">save [-p|--patch] [-S|--staged] [-k|--[no-]keep-index]
    [-u|--include-untracked] [-a|--all] [-q|--quiet] [&lt;message&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is deprecated in favour of <i>git stash
  push</i>. It differs from &quot;stash push&quot; in that it cannot take
  pathspec. Instead, all non-option arguments are concatenated to form the stash
  message.</div>
<p class="Pp">list [&lt;log-options&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">List the stash entries that you currently have. Each
  <i>stash entry</i> is listed with its name (e.g. <b>stash@{0}</b> is the
  latest entry, <b>stash@{1}</b> is the one before, etc.), the name of the
  branch that was current when the entry was made, and a short description of
  the commit the entry was based on.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>stash@{0}: WIP on submit: 6ebd0e2... Update git-stash documentation
stash@{1}: On master: 9cc0589... Add git-stash</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The command takes options applicable to the <i>git log</i> command
    to control what is shown and how. See <b>git-log</b>(1).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">show [-u|--include-untracked|--only-untracked]
    [&lt;diff-options&gt;] [&lt;stash&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the changes recorded in the stash entry as a diff
  between the stashed contents and the commit back when the stash entry was
  first created. By default, the command shows the diffstat, but it will accept
  any format known to <i>git diff</i> (e.g., <b>git stash show -p stash@{1}</b>
  to view the second most recent entry in patch form). If no
  <b>&lt;diff-option&gt;</b> is provided, the default behavior will be given by
  the <b>stash.showStat</b>, and <b>stash.showPatch</b> config variables. You
  can also use <b>stash.showIncludeUntracked</b> to set whether
  <b>--include-untracked</b> is enabled by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">pop [--index] [-q|--quiet] [&lt;stash&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Remove a single stashed state from the stash list and
  apply it on top of the current working tree state, i.e., do the inverse
  operation of <b>git stash push</b>. The working directory must match the
  index.
<p class="Pp">Applying the state can fail with conflicts; in this case, it is
    not removed from the stash list. You need to resolve the conflicts by hand
    and call <b>git stash drop</b> manually afterwards.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">apply [--index] [-q|--quiet] [&lt;stash&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Like <b>pop</b>, but do not remove the state from the
  stash list. Unlike <b>pop</b>, <b>&lt;stash&gt;</b> may be any commit that
  looks like a commit created by <b>stash push</b> or <b>stash create</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">branch &lt;branchname&gt; [&lt;stash&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Creates and checks out a new branch named
  <b>&lt;branchname&gt;</b> starting from the commit at which the
  <b>&lt;stash&gt;</b> was originally created, applies the changes recorded in
  <b>&lt;stash&gt;</b> to the new working tree and index. If that succeeds, and
  <b>&lt;stash&gt;</b> is a reference of the form
  <b>stash@{&lt;revision&gt;}</b>, it then drops the <b>&lt;stash&gt;</b>.
<p class="Pp">This is useful if the branch on which you ran <b>git stash
    push</b> has changed enough that <b>git stash apply</b> fails due to
    conflicts. Since the stash entry is applied on top of the commit that was
    HEAD at the time <b>git stash</b> was run, it restores the originally
    stashed state with no conflicts.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">clear</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Remove all the stash entries. Note that those entries
  will then be subject to pruning, and may be impossible to recover (see
  <i>Examples</i> below for a possible strategy).</div>
<p class="Pp">drop [-q|--quiet] [&lt;stash&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Remove a single stash entry from the list of stash
  entries.</div>
<p class="Pp">create</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Create a stash entry (which is a regular commit object)
  and return its object name, without storing it anywhere in the ref namespace.
  This is intended to be useful for scripts. It is probably not the command you
  want to use; see &quot;push&quot; above.</div>
<p class="Pp">store</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Store a given stash created via <i>git stash create</i>
  (which is a dangling merge commit) in the stash ref, updating the stash
  reflog. This is intended to be useful for scripts. It is probably not the
  command you want to use; see &quot;push&quot; above.</div>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">-a, --all</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is only valid for <b>push</b> and <b>save</b>
  commands.
<p class="Pp">All ignored and untracked files are also stashed and then cleaned
    up with <b>git clean</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-u, --include-untracked, --no-include-untracked</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When used with the <b>push</b> and <b>save</b> commands,
  all untracked files are also stashed and then cleaned up with <b>git
  clean</b>.
<p class="Pp">When used with the <b>show</b> command, show the untracked files
    in the stash entry as part of the diff.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--only-untracked</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is only valid for the <b>show</b> command.
<p class="Pp">Show only the untracked files in the stash entry as part of the
    diff.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is only valid for <b>pop</b> and <b>apply</b>
  commands.
<p class="Pp">Tries to reinstate not only the working tree&#x2019;s changes, but
    also the index&#x2019;s ones. However, this can fail, when you have
    conflicts (which are stored in the index, where you therefore can no longer
    apply the changes as they were originally).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-k, --keep-index, --no-keep-index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is only valid for <b>push</b> and <b>save</b>
  commands.
<p class="Pp">All changes already added to the index are left intact.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-p, --patch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is only valid for <b>push</b> and <b>save</b>
  commands.
<p class="Pp">Interactively select hunks from the diff between HEAD and the
    working tree to be stashed. The stash entry is constructed such that its
    index state is the same as the index state of your repository, and its
    worktree contains only the changes you selected interactively. The selected
    changes are then rolled back from your worktree. See the &#x201C;Interactive
    Mode&#x201D; section of <b>git-add</b>(1) to learn how to operate the
    <b>--patch</b> mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>--patch</b> option implies <b>--keep-index</b>. You can use
    <b>--no-keep-index</b> to override this.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-S, --staged</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is only valid for <b>push</b> and <b>save</b>
  commands.
<p class="Pp">Stash only the changes that are currently staged. This is similar
    to basic <b>git commit</b> except the state is committed to the stash
    instead of current branch.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>--patch</b> option has priority over this one.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is only valid for <b>push</b> command.
<p class="Pp">Pathspec is passed in <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> instead of commandline
    args. If <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> is exactly <b>-</b> then standard input is
    used. Pathspec elements are separated by LF or CR/LF. Pathspec elements can
    be quoted as explained for the configuration variable <b>core.quotePath</b>
    (see <b>git-config</b>(1)). See also <b>--pathspec-file-nul</b> and global
    <b>--literal-pathspecs</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--pathspec-file-nul</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is only valid for <b>push</b> command.
<p class="Pp">Only meaningful with <b>--pathspec-from-file</b>. Pathspec
    elements are separated with NUL character and all other characters are taken
    literally (including newlines and quotes).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-q, --quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is only valid for <b>apply</b>, <b>drop</b>,
  <b>pop</b>, <b>push</b>, <b>save</b>, <b>store</b> commands.
<p class="Pp">Quiet, suppress feedback messages.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is only valid for <b>push</b> command.
<p class="Pp">Separates pathspec from options for disambiguation purposes.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;pathspec&gt;...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is only valid for <b>push</b> command.
<p class="Pp">The new stash entry records the modified states only for the files
    that match the pathspec. The index entries and working tree files are then
    rolled back to the state in HEAD only for these files, too, leaving files
    that do not match the pathspec intact.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more details, see the <i>pathspec</i> entry in

<p class="Pp">A reference of the form <b>stash@{&lt;revision&gt;}</b>. When no

<h1 class="Sh" id="DISCUSSION"><a class="permalink" href="#DISCUSSION">DISCUSSION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A stash entry is represented as a commit whose tree records the
    state of the working directory, and its first parent is the commit at
    <b>HEAD</b> when the entry was created. The tree of the second parent
    records the state of the index when the entry is made, and it is made a
    child of the <b>HEAD</b> commit. The ancestry graph looks like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
       .----W
      /    /
-----H----I</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">where <b>H</b> is the <b>HEAD</b> commit, <b>I</b> is a commit
    that records the state of the index, and <b>W</b> is a commit that records
    the state of the working tree.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Pulling into a dirty tree</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When you are in the middle of something, you learn that
  there are upstream changes that are possibly relevant to what you are doing.
  When your local changes do not conflict with the changes in the upstream, a
  simple <b>git pull</b> will let you move forward.
<p class="Pp">However, there are cases in which your local changes do conflict
    with the upstream changes, and <b>git pull</b> refuses to overwrite your
    changes. In such a case, you can stash your changes away, perform a pull,
    and then unstash, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git pull
 ...
file foobar not up to date, cannot merge.
$ git stash
$ git pull
$ git stash pop</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Interrupted workflow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When you are in the middle of something, your boss comes
  in and demands that you fix something immediately. Traditionally, you would
  make a commit to a temporary branch to store your changes away, and return to
  your original branch to make the emergency fix, like this:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre># ... hack hack hack ...
$ git switch -c my_wip
$ git commit -a -m &quot;WIP&quot;
$ git switch master
$ edit emergency fix
$ git commit -a -m &quot;Fix in a hurry&quot;
$ git switch my_wip
$ git reset --soft HEAD^
# ... continue hacking ...</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">You can use <i>git stash</i> to simplify the above, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre># ... hack hack hack ...
$ git stash
$ edit emergency fix
$ git commit -a -m &quot;Fix in a hurry&quot;
$ git stash pop
# ... continue hacking ...</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Testing partial commits</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">You can use <b>git stash push --keep-index</b> when you
  want to make two or more commits out of the changes in the work tree, and you
  want to test each change before committing:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre># ... hack hack hack ...
$ git add --patch foo            # add just first part to the index
$ git stash push --keep-index    # save all other changes to the stash
$ edit/build/test first part
$ git commit -m 'First part'     # commit fully tested change
$ git stash pop                  # prepare to work on all other changes
# ... repeat above five steps until one commit remains ...
$ edit/build/test remaining parts
$ git commit foo -m 'Remaining parts'</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Saving unrelated changes for future use</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When you are in the middle of massive changes and you
  find some unrelated issue that you don&#x2019;t want to forget to fix, you can
  do the change(s), stage them, and use <b>git stash push --staged</b> to stash
  them out for future use. This is similar to committing the staged changes,
  only the commit ends-up being in the stash and not on the current branch.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre># ... hack hack hack ...
$ git add --patch foo           # add unrelated changes to the index
$ git stash push --staged       # save these changes to the stash
# ... hack hack hack, finish curent changes ...
$ git commit -m 'Massive'       # commit fully tested changes
$ git switch fixup-branch       # switch to another branch
$ git stash pop                 # to finish work on the saved changes</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Recovering stash entries that were cleared/dropped erroneously</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If you mistakenly drop or clear stash entries, they
  cannot be recovered through the normal safety mechanisms. However, you can try
  the following incantation to get a list of stash entries that are still in
  your repository, but not reachable any more:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>git fsck --unreachable |
grep commit | cut -d\  -f3 |
xargs git log --merges --no-walk --grep=WIP</pre>
