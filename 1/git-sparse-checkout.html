<p class="Pp"><i>list</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Describe the patterns in the sparse-checkout file.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>init</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable the <b>core.sparseCheckout</b> setting. If the
  sparse-checkout file does not exist, then populate it with patterns that match
  every file in the root directory and no other directories, then will remove
  all directories tracked by Git. Add patterns to the sparse-checkout file to
  repopulate the working directory.
<p class="Pp">To avoid interfering with other worktrees, it first enables the
    <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b> setting and makes sure to set the
    <b>core.sparseCheckout</b> setting in the worktree-specific config file.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>--cone</b> is provided, the <b>core.sparseCheckoutCone</b>
    setting is also set, allowing for better performance with a limited set of
    patterns (see <i>CONE PATTERN SET</i> below).</p>
<p class="Pp">Use the <b>--[no-]sparse-index</b> option to toggle the use of the
    sparse index format. This reduces the size of the index to be more closely
    aligned with your sparse-checkout definition. This can have significant
    performance advantages for commands such as <b>git status</b> or <b>git
    add</b>. This feature is still experimental. Some commands might be slower
    with a sparse index until they are properly integrated with the feature.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>WARNING:</b> Using a sparse index requires modifying the index
    in a way that is not completely understood by external tools. If you have
    trouble with this compatibility, then run <b>git sparse-checkout init
    --no-sparse-index</b> to rewrite your index to not be sparse. Older versions
    of Git will not understand the sparse directory entries index extension and
    may fail to interact with your repository until it is disabled.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>set</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Write a set of patterns to the sparse-checkout file, as
  given as a list of arguments following the <i>set</i> subcommand. Update the
  working directory to match the new patterns. Enable the core.sparseCheckout
  config setting if it is not already enabled.
<p class="Pp">When the <b>--stdin</b> option is provided, the patterns are read
    from standard in as a newline-delimited list instead of from the
  arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>core.sparseCheckoutCone</b> is enabled, the input list is
    considered a list of directories instead of sparse-checkout patterns. The
    command writes patterns to the sparse-checkout file to include all files
    contained in those directories (recursively) as well as files that are
    siblings of ancestor directories. The input format matches the output of
    <b>git ls-tree --name-only</b>. This includes interpreting pathnames that
    begin with a double quote (&quot;) as C-style quoted strings.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>add</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Update the sparse-checkout file to include additional
  patterns. By default, these patterns are read from the command-line arguments,
  but they can be read from stdin using the <b>--stdin</b> option. When
  <b>core.sparseCheckoutCone</b> is enabled, the given patterns are interpreted
  as directory names as in the <i>set</i> subcommand.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>reapply</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Reapply the sparsity pattern rules to paths in the
  working tree. Commands like merge or rebase can materialize paths to do their
  work (e.g. in order to show you a conflict), and other sparse-checkout
  commands might fail to sparsify an individual file (e.g. because it has
  unstaged changes or conflicts). In such cases, it can make sense to run <b>git
  sparse-checkout reapply</b> later after cleaning up affected paths (e.g.
  resolving conflicts, undoing or committing changes, etc.).</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>disable</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disable the <b>core.sparseCheckout</b> config setting,
  and restore the working directory to include all files. Leaves the
  sparse-checkout file intact so a later <i>git sparse-checkout init</i> command
  may return the working directory to the same state.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SPARSE_CHECKOUT"><a class="permalink" href="#SPARSE_CHECKOUT">SPARSE
  CHECKOUT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">&quot;Sparse checkout&quot; allows populating the working
    directory sparsely. It uses the skip-worktree bit (see
    <b>git-update-index</b>(1)) to tell Git whether a file in the working
    directory is worth looking at. If the skip-worktree bit is set, then the
    file is ignored in the working directory. Git will not populate the contents
    of those files, which makes a sparse checkout helpful when working in a
    repository with many files, but only a few are important to the current
    user.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</b> file is used to define
    the skip-worktree reference bitmap. When Git updates the working directory,
    it updates the skip-worktree bits in the index based on this file. The files
    matching the patterns in the file will appear in the working directory, and
    the rest will not.</p>
<p class="Pp">To enable the sparse-checkout feature, run <b>git sparse-checkout
    init</b> to initialize a simple sparse-checkout file and enable the
    <b>core.sparseCheckout</b> config setting. Then, run <b>git sparse-checkout
    set</b> to modify the patterns in the sparse-checkout file.</p>
<p class="Pp">To repopulate the working directory with all files, use the <b>git
    sparse-checkout disable</b> command.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FULL_PATTERN_SET"><a class="permalink" href="#FULL_PATTERN_SET">FULL
  PATTERN SET</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">By default, the sparse-checkout file uses the same syntax as
    <b>.gitignore</b> files.</p>
<p class="Pp">While <b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</b> is usually used to
    specify what files are included, you can also specify what files are
    <i>not</i> included, using negative patterns. For example, to remove the
    file <b>unwanted</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
/*
!unwanted
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONE_PATTERN_SET"><a class="permalink" href="#CONE_PATTERN_SET">CONE
  PATTERN SET</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The full pattern set allows for arbitrary pattern matches and
    complicated inclusion/exclusion rules. These can result in O(N*M) pattern
    matches when updating the index, where N is the number of patterns and M is
    the number of paths in the index. To combat this performance issue, a more
    restricted pattern set is allowed when <b>core.sparseCheckoutCone</b> is
    enabled.</p>
<p class="Pp">The accepted patterns in the cone pattern set are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.<b>Recursive:</b> All paths inside a directory are
  included.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.<b>Parent:</b> All files immediately inside a
  directory are included.</div>
<p class="Pp">In addition to the above two patterns, we also expect that all
    files in the root directory are included. If a recursive pattern is added,
    then all leading directories are added as parent patterns.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, when running <b>git sparse-checkout init</b>, the root
    directory is added as a parent pattern. At this point, the sparse-checkout
    file contains the following patterns:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
/*
!/*/
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This says &quot;include everything in root, but nothing two levels
    below root.&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">When in cone mode, the <b>git sparse-checkout set</b> subcommand
    takes a list of directories instead of a list of sparse-checkout patterns.
    In this mode, the command <b>git sparse-checkout set A/B/C</b> sets the
    directory <b>A/B/C</b> as a recursive pattern, the directories <b>A</b> and
    <b>A/B</b> are added as parent patterns. The resulting sparse-checkout file
    is now</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
/*
!/*/
/A/
!/A/*/
/A/B/
!/A/B/*/
/A/B/C/
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Here, order matters, so the negative patterns are overridden by
    the positive patterns that appear lower in the file.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>core.sparseCheckoutCone=true</b>, then Git will parse the
    sparse-checkout file expecting patterns of these types. Git will warn if the
    patterns do not match. If the patterns do match the expected format, then
    Git will use faster hash- based algorithms to compute inclusion in the
    sparse-checkout.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the cone mode case, the <b>git sparse-checkout list</b>
    subcommand will list the directories that define the recursive patterns. For
    the example sparse-checkout file above, the output is as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git sparse-checkout list
A/B/C
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>core.ignoreCase=true</b>, then the pattern-matching
    algorithm will use a case-insensitive check. This corrects for case
    mismatched filenames in the <i>git sparse-checkout set</i> command to
    reflect the expected cone in the working directory.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SUBMODULES"><a class="permalink" href="#SUBMODULES">SUBMODULES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If your repository contains one or more submodules, then
    submodules are populated based on interactions with the <b>git submodule</b>
    command. Specifically, <b>git submodule init -- &lt;path&gt;</b> will ensure
    the submodule at <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> is present, while <b>git submodule
    deinit [-f] -- &lt;path&gt;</b> will remove the files for the submodule at
    <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> (including any untracked files, uncommitted changes, and
    unpushed history). Similar to how sparse-checkout removes files from the
    working tree but still leaves entries in the index, deinitialized submodules
    are removed from the working directory but still have an entry in the
  index.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since submodules may have unpushed changes or untracked files,
    removing them could result in data loss. Thus, changing sparse
    inclusion/exclusion rules will not cause an already checked out submodule to
    be removed from the working copy. Said another way, just as <b>checkout</b>
    will not cause submodules to be automatically removed or initialized even
    when switching between branches that remove or add submodules, using
    <b>sparse-checkout</b> to reduce or expand the scope of
    &quot;interesting&quot; files will not cause submodules to be automatically
    deinitialized or initialized either.</p>
<p class="Pp">Further, the above facts mean that there are multiple reasons that
    &quot;tracked&quot; files might not be present in the working copy: sparsity
    pattern application from sparse-checkout, and submodule initialization
    state. Thus, commands like <b>git grep</b> that work on tracked files in the
    working copy may return results that are limited by either or both of these
    restrictions.</p>
