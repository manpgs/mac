<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This command is used to create sparse checkouts, which change the
    working tree from having all tracked files present to only having a subset
    of those files. It can also switch which subset of files are present, or
    undo and go back to having all tracked files present in the working
  copy.</p>
<p class="Pp">The subset of files is chosen by providing a list of directories
    in cone mode (the default), or by providing a list of patterns in non-cone
    mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">When in a sparse-checkout, other Git commands behave a bit
    differently. For example, switching branches will not update paths outside
    the sparse-checkout directories/patterns, and <b>git commit -a</b> will not
    record paths outside the sparse-checkout directories/patterns as
  deleted.</p>
<p class="Pp">THIS COMMAND IS EXPERIMENTAL. ITS BEHAVIOR, AND THE BEHAVIOR OF
    OTHER COMMANDS IN THE PRESENCE OF SPARSE-CHECKOUTS, WILL LIKELY CHANGE IN
    THE FUTURE.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMANDS">COMMANDS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>list</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Describe the directories or patterns in the
  sparse-checkout file.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>set</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable the necessary sparse-checkout config settings
  (<b>core.sparseCheckout</b>, <b>core.sparseCheckoutCone</b>, and
  <b>index.sparse</b>) if they are not already set to the desired values,
  populate the sparse-checkout file from the list of arguments following the
  <i>set</i> subcommand, and update the working directory to match.
<p class="Pp">To ensure that adjusting the sparse-checkout settings within a
    worktree does not alter the sparse-checkout settings in other worktrees, the
    <i>set</i> subcommand will upgrade your repository config to use
    worktree-specific config if not already present. The sparsity defined by the
    arguments to the <i>set</i> subcommand are stored in the worktree-specific
    sparse-checkout file. See <b>git-worktree</b>(1) and the documentation of
    <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b> in <b>git-config</b>(1) for more
  details.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>--stdin</b> option is provided, the directories or
    patterns are read from standard in as a newline-delimited list instead of
    from the arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, the input list is considered a list of directories,
    matching the output of <b>git ls-tree -d --name-only</b>. This includes
    interpreting pathnames that begin with a double quote (&quot;) as C-style
    quoted strings. Note that all files under the specified directories (at any
    depth) will be included in the sparse checkout, as well as files that are
    siblings of either the given directory or any of its ancestors (see <i>CONE
    PATTERN SET</i> below for more details). In the past, this was not the
    default, and <b>--cone</b> needed to be specified or
    <b>core.sparseCheckoutCone</b> needed to be enabled.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>--no-cone</b> is passed, the input list is considered a
    list of patterns. This mode has a number of drawbacks, including not working
    with some options like <b>--sparse-index</b>. As explained in the
    &quot;Non-cone Problems&quot; section below, we do not recommend using
  it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Use the <b>--[no-]sparse-index</b> option to use a sparse index
    (the default is to not use it). A sparse index reduces the size of the index
    to be more closely aligned with your sparse-checkout definition. This can
    have significant performance advantages for commands such as <b>git
    status</b> or <b>git add</b>. This feature is still experimental. Some
    commands might be slower with a sparse index until they are properly
    integrated with the feature.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>WARNING:</b> Using a sparse index requires modifying the index
    in a way that is not completely understood by external tools. If you have
    trouble with this compatibility, then run <b>git sparse-checkout init
    --no-sparse-index</b> to rewrite your index to not be sparse. Older versions
    of Git will not understand the sparse directory entries index extension and
    may fail to interact with your repository until it is disabled.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>add</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Update the sparse-checkout file to include additional
  directories (in cone mode) or patterns (in non-cone mode). By default, these
  directories or patterns are read from the command-line arguments, but they can
  be read from stdin using the <b>--stdin</b> option.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>reapply</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Reapply the sparsity pattern rules to paths in the
  working tree. Commands like merge or rebase can materialize paths to do their
  work (e.g. in order to show you a conflict), and other sparse-checkout
  commands might fail to sparsify an individual file (e.g. because it has
  unstaged changes or conflicts). In such cases, it can make sense to run <b>git
  sparse-checkout reapply</b> later after cleaning up affected paths (e.g.
  resolving conflicts, undoing or committing changes, etc.).
<p class="Pp">The <b>reapply</b> command can also take <b>--[no-]cone</b> and
    <b>--[no-]sparse-index</b> flags, with the same meaning as the flags from
    the <b>set</b> command, in order to change which sparsity mode you are using
    without needing to also respecify all sparsity paths.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>disable</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disable the <b>core.sparseCheckout</b> config setting,
  and restore the working directory to include all files.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>init</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deprecated command that behaves like <b>set</b> with no
  specified paths. May be removed in the future.
<p class="Pp">Historically, <b>set</b> did not handle all the necessary config
    settings, which meant that both <b>init</b> and <b>set</b> had to be called.
    Invoking both meant the <b>init</b> step would first remove nearly all
    tracked files (and in cone mode, ignored files too), then the <b>set</b>
    step would add many of the tracked files (but not ignored files) back. In
    addition to the lost files, the performance and UI of this combination was
    poor.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also, historically, <b>init</b> would not actually initialize the
    sparse-checkout file if it already existed. This meant it was possible to
    return to a sparse-checkout without remembering which paths to pass to a
    subsequent <i>set</i> or <i>add</i> command. However, <b>--cone</b> and
    <b>--sparse-index</b> options would not be remembered across the disable
    command, so the easy restore of calling a plain <b>init</b> decreased in
    utility.</p>
</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>git sparse-checkout set MY/DIR1 SUB/DIR2</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Change to a sparse checkout with all files (at any depth)
  under MY/DIR1/ and SUB/DIR2/ present in the working copy (plus all files
  immediately under MY/ and SUB/ and the toplevel directory). If already in a
  sparse checkout, change which files are present in the working copy to this
  new selection. Note that this command will also delete all ignored files in
  any directory that no longer has either tracked or non-ignored-untracked files
  present.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git sparse-checkout disable</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Repopulate the working directory with all files,
  disabling sparse checkouts.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git sparse-checkout add SOME/DIR/ECTORY</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Add all files under SOME/DIR/ECTORY/ (at any depth) to
  the sparse checkout, as well as all files immediately under SOME/DIR/ and
  immediately under SOME/. Must already be in a sparse checkout before using
  this command.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git sparse-checkout reapply</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">It is possible for commands to update the working tree in
  a way that does not respect the selected sparsity directories. This can come
  from tools external to Git writing files, or even affect Git commands because
  of either special cases (such as hitting conflicts when merging/rebasing), or
  because some commands didn&#x2019;t fully support sparse checkouts (e.g. the
  old <b>recursive</b> merge backend had only limited support). This command
  reapplies the existing sparse directory specifications to make the working
  directory match.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh">INTERNALS &#x2014; SPARSE CHECKOUT</h1>
<p class="Pp">&quot;Sparse checkout&quot; allows populating the working
    directory sparsely. It uses the skip-worktree bit (see
    <b>git-update-index</b>(1)) to tell Git whether a file in the working
    directory is worth looking at. If the skip-worktree bit is set, and the file
    is not present in the working tree, then its absence is ignored. Git will
    avoid populating the contents of those files, which makes a sparse checkout
    helpful when working in a repository with many files, but only a few are
    important to the current user.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</b> file is used to define
    the skip-worktree reference bitmap. When Git updates the working directory,
    it updates the skip-worktree bits in the index based on this file. The files
    matching the patterns in the file will appear in the working directory, and
    the rest will not.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh">INTERNALS &#x2014; NON-CONE PROBLEMS</h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</b> file populated by the
    <b>set</b> and <b>add</b> subcommands is defined to be a bunch of patterns
    (one per line) using the same syntax as <b>.gitignore</b> files. In cone
    mode, these patterns are restricted to matching directories (and users only
    ever need supply or see directory names), while in non-cone mode any
    gitignore-style pattern is permitted. Using the full gitignore-style
    patterns in non-cone mode has a number of shortcomings:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Fundamentally, it makes various worktree-updating
  processes (pull, merge, rebase, switch, reset, checkout, etc.) require O(N*M)
  pattern matches, where N is the number of patterns and M is the number of
  paths in the index. This scales poorly.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Avoiding the scaling issue has to be done via
  limiting the number of patterns via specifying leading directory name or
  glob.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Passing globs on the command line is error-prone
  as users may forget to quote the glob, causing the shell to expand it into all
  matching files and pass them all individually along to sparse-checkout
  set/add. While this could also be a problem with e.g. &quot;git grep &#x2014;
  *.c&quot;, mistakes with grep/log/status appear in the immediate output. With
  sparse-checkout, the mistake gets recorded at the time the sparse-checkout
  command is run and might not be problematic until the user later switches
  branches or rebases or merges, thus putting a delay between the user&#x2019;s
  error and when they have a chance to catch/notice it.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Related to the previous item, sparse-checkout has
  an <i>add</i> subcommand but no <i>remove</i> subcommand. Even if a
  <i>remove</i> subcommand were added, undoing an accidental unquoted glob runs
  the risk of &quot;removing too much&quot;, as it may remove entries that had
  been included before the accidental add.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Non-cone mode uses gitignore-style patterns to
  select what to <b>include</b> (with the exception of negated patterns), while
  .gitignore files use gitignore-style patterns to select what to <b>exclude</b>
  (with the exception of negated patterns). The documentation on gitignore-style
  patterns usually does not talk in terms of matching or non-matching, but on
  what the user wants to &quot;exclude&quot;. This can cause confusion for users
  trying to learn how to specify sparse-checkout patterns to get their desired
  behavior.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Every other git subcommand that wants to provide
  &quot;special path pattern matching&quot; of some sort uses pathspecs, but
  non-cone mode for sparse-checkout uses gitignore patterns, which feels
  inconsistent.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;It has edge cases where the &quot;right&quot;
  behavior is unclear. Two examples:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>First, two users are in a subdirectory, and the first runs
   git sparse-checkout set '/toplevel-dir/*.c'
while the second runs
   git sparse-checkout set relative-dir
Should those arguments be transliterated into
   current/subdirectory/toplevel-dir/*.c
and
   current/subdirectory/relative-dir
before inserting into the sparse-checkout file?  The user who typed
the first command is probably aware that arguments to set/add are
supposed to be patterns in non-cone mode, and probably would not be
happy with such a transliteration.  However, many gitignore-style
patterns are just paths, which might be what the user who typed the
second command was thinking, and they'd be upset if their argument
wasn't transliterated.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Second, what should bash-completion complete on for set/add commands
for non-cone users?  If it suggests paths, is it exacerbating the
problem above?  Also, if it suggests paths, what if the user has a
file or directory that begins with either a '!' or '#' or has a '*',
'\', '?', '[', or ']' in its name?  And if it suggests paths, will
it complete &quot;/pro&quot; to &quot;/proc&quot; (in the root filesytem) rather than to
&quot;/progress.txt&quot; in the current directory?  (Note that users are
likely to want to start paths with a leading '/' in non-cone mode,
for the same reason that .gitignore files often have one.)
Completing on files or directories might give nasty surprises in
all these cases.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The excessive flexibility made other extensions
  essentially impractical. <b>--sparse-index</b> is likely impossible in
  non-cone mode; even if it is somehow feasible, it would have been far more
  work to implement and may have been too slow in practice. Some ideas for
  adding coupling between partial clones and sparse checkouts are only practical
  with a more restricted set of paths as well.</div>
<p class="Pp">For all these reasons, non-cone mode is deprecated. Please switch
    to using cone mode.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh">INTERNALS &#x2014; CONE MODE HANDLING</h1>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;cone mode&quot;, which is the default, lets you specify
    only what directories to include. For any directory specified, all paths
    below that directory will be included, and any paths immediately under
    leading directories (including the toplevel directory) will also be
    included. Thus, if you specified the directory Documentation/technical/ then
    your sparse checkout would contain:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;all files in the toplevel-directory</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;all files immediately under Documentation/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;all files at any depth under
  Documentation/technical/</div>
<p class="Pp">Also, in cone mode, even if no directories are specified, then the
    files in the toplevel directory will be included.</p>
<p class="Pp">When changing the sparse-checkout patterns in cone mode, Git will
    inspect each tracked directory that is not within the sparse-checkout cone
    to see if it contains any untracked files. If all of those files are ignored
    due to the <b>.gitignore</b> patterns, then the directory will be deleted.
    If any of the untracked files within that directory is not ignored, then no
    deletions will occur within that directory and a warning message will
    appear. If these files are important, then reset your sparse-checkout
    definition so they are included, use <b>git add</b> and <b>git commit</b> to
    store them, then remove any remaining files manually to ensure Git can
    behave optimally.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also the &quot;Internals &#x2014; Cone Pattern Set&quot;
    section to learn how the directories are transformed under the hood into a
    subset of the Full Pattern Set of sparse-checkout.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh">INTERNALS &#x2014; FULL PATTERN SET</h1>
<p class="Pp">The full pattern set allows for arbitrary pattern matches and
    complicated inclusion/exclusion rules. These can result in O(N*M) pattern
    matches when updating the index, where N is the number of patterns and M is
    the number of paths in the index. To combat this performance issue, a more
    restricted pattern set is allowed when <b>core.sparseCheckoutCone</b> is
    enabled.</p>
<p class="Pp">The sparse-checkout file uses the same syntax as <b>.gitignore</b>
    files; see <b>gitignore</b>(5) for details. Here, though, the patterns are
    usually being used to select which files to include rather than which files
    to exclude. (However, it can get a bit confusing since gitignore-style
    patterns have negations defined by patterns which begin with a <i>!</i>, so
    you can also select files to <i>not</i> include.)</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, to select everything, and then to remove the file
    <b>unwanted</b> (so that every file will appear in your working tree except
    the file named <b>unwanted</b>):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>git sparse-checkout set --no-cone '/*' '!unwanted'</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">These patterns are just placed into the
    <b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</b> as-is, so the contents of that file at
    this point would be</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>/*
!unwanted</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">See also the &quot;Sparse Checkout&quot; section of
    <b>git-read-tree</b>(1) to learn more about the gitignore-style patterns
    used in sparse checkouts.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh">INTERNALS &#x2014; CONE PATTERN SET</h1>
<p class="Pp">In cone mode, only directories are accepted, but they are
    translated into the same gitignore-style patterns used in the full pattern
    set. We refer to the particular patterns used in those mode as being of one
    of two types:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.<b>Recursive:</b> All paths inside a directory are
  included.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.<b>Parent:</b> All files immediately inside a
  directory are included.</div>
<p class="Pp">Since cone mode always includes files at the toplevel, when
    running <b>git sparse-checkout set</b> with no directories specified, the
    toplevel directory is added as a parent pattern. At this point, the
    sparse-checkout file contains the following patterns:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>/*
!/*/</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This says &quot;include everything immediately under the toplevel
    directory, but nothing at any level below that.&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">When in cone mode, the <b>git sparse-checkout set</b> subcommand
    takes a list of directories. The command <b>git sparse-checkout set
    A/B/C</b> sets the directory <b>A/B/C</b> as a recursive pattern, the
    directories <b>A</b> and <b>A/B</b> are added as parent patterns. The
    resulting sparse-checkout file is now</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>/*
!/*/
/A/
!/A/*/
/A/B/
!/A/B/*/
/A/B/C/</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Here, order matters, so the negative patterns are overridden by
    the positive patterns that appear lower in the file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless <b>core.sparseCheckoutCone</b> is explicitly set to
    <b>false</b>, Git will parse the sparse-checkout file expecting patterns of
    these types. Git will warn if the patterns do not match. If the patterns do
    match the expected format, then Git will use faster hash-based algorithms to
    compute inclusion in the sparse-checkout. If they do not match, git will
    behave as though <b>core.sparseCheckoutCone</b> was false, regardless of its
    setting.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the cone mode case, despite the fact that full patterns are
    written to the $GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout file, the <b>git
    sparse-checkout list</b> subcommand will list the directories that define
    the recursive patterns. For the example sparse-checkout file above, the
    output is as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git sparse-checkout list
A/B/C</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>core.ignoreCase=true</b>, then the pattern-matching
    algorithm will use a case-insensitive check. This corrects for case
    mismatched filenames in the <i>git sparse-checkout set</i> command to
    reflect the expected cone in the working directory.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh">INTERNALS &#x2014; SUBMODULES</h1>
<p class="Pp">If your repository contains one or more submodules, then
    submodules are populated based on interactions with the <b>git submodule</b>
    command. Specifically, <b>git submodule init -- &lt;path&gt;</b> will ensure
    the submodule at <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> is present, while <b>git submodule
    deinit [-f] -- &lt;path&gt;</b> will remove the files for the submodule at
    <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> (including any untracked files, uncommitted changes, and
    unpushed history). Similar to how sparse-checkout removes files from the
    working tree but still leaves entries in the index, deinitialized submodules
    are removed from the working directory but still have an entry in the
  index.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since submodules may have unpushed changes or untracked files,
    removing them could result in data loss. Thus, changing sparse
    inclusion/exclusion rules will not cause an already checked out submodule to
    be removed from the working copy. Said another way, just as <b>checkout</b>
    will not cause submodules to be automatically removed or initialized even
    when switching between branches that remove or add submodules, using
    <b>sparse-checkout</b> to reduce or expand the scope of
    &quot;interesting&quot; files will not cause submodules to be automatically
    deinitialized or initialized either.</p>
<p class="Pp">Further, the above facts mean that there are multiple reasons that
    &quot;tracked&quot; files might not be present in the working copy: sparsity
    pattern application from sparse-checkout, and submodule initialization
    state. Thus, commands like <b>git grep</b> that work on tracked files in the
    working copy may return results that are limited by either or both of these
    restrictions.</p>
