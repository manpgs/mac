<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Unpack the source package <i>perl5.8*.tar.gz</i> with djtarx. If you want
      to use long file names under w95 and also to get Perl to pass all its
      tests, don't forget to use
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        set LFN=y
        set FNCASE=y
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">before unpacking the archive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Create a &quot;symlink&quot; or copy your bash.exe to sh.exe in your
      <span class="Li">&quot;($DJDIR)/bin&quot;</span> directory.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        ln -s bash.exe sh.exe
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">[If you have the recommended version of bash for DJGPP, this
        is already done for you.]</p>
    <p class="Pp">And make the <span class="Li">&quot;SHELL&quot;</span>
        environment variable point to this <i>sh.exe</i>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        set SHELL=c:/djgpp/bin/sh.exe (use full path name!)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can do this in <i>djgpp.env</i> too. Add this line BEFORE
        any section definition:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        +SHELL=%DJDIR%/bin/sh.exe
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>If you have <i>split.exe</i> and <i>gsplit.exe</i> in your path, then
      rename <i>split.exe</i> to <i>djsplit.exe</i>, and <i>gsplit.exe</i> to
      <i>split.exe</i>. Copy or link <i>gecho.exe</i> to <i>echo.exe</i> if you
      don't have <i>echo.exe</i>. Copy or link <i>gawk.exe</i> to <i>awk.exe</i>
      if you don't have <i>awk.exe</i>.
    <p class="Pp">[If you have the recommended versions of djdev, shell
        utilities and gawk, all these are already done for you, and you will not
        need to do anything.]</p>
  </li>
  <li>Chdir to the djgpp subdirectory of perl toplevel and type the following
      commands:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        set FNCASE=y
        configure.bat
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This will do some preprocessing then run the Configure script
        for you. The Configure script is interactive, but in most cases you just
        need to press ENTER. The &quot;set&quot; command ensures that DJGPP
        preserves the letter case of file names when reading directories. If you
        already issued this set command when unpacking the archive, and you are
        in the same DOS session as when you unpacked the archive, you don't have
        to issue the set command again. This command is necessary *before* you
        start to (re)configure or (re)build perl in order to ensure both that
        perl builds correctly and that building XS-type modules can succeed. See
        the DJGPP info entry for &quot;_preserve_fncase&quot; for more
        information:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        info libc alphabetical _preserve_fncase
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the script says that your package is incomplete, and asks
        whether to continue, just answer with Y (this can only happen if you
        don't use long filenames or forget to issue &quot;set FNCASE=y&quot;
        first).</p>
    <p class="Pp">When Configure asks about the extensions, I suggest IO and
        Fcntl, and if you want database handling then SDBM_File or GDBM_File
        (you need to install gdbm for this one). If you want to use the POSIX
        extension (this is the default), make sure that the stack size of your
        <i>cc1.exe</i> is at least 512kbyte (you can check this with:
        <span class="Li">&quot;stubedit cc1.exe&quot;</span>).</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can use the Configure script in non-interactive mode too.
        When I built my <i>perl.exe</i>, I used something like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        configure.bat -des
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can find more info about Configure's command line switches
        in the <i>INSTALL</i> file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When the script ends, and you want to change some values in
        the generated <i>config.sh</i> file, then run</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        sh Configure -S
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">after you made your modifications.</p>
    <p class="Pp">IMPORTANT: if you use this
        <span class="Li">&quot;-S&quot;</span> switch, be sure to delete the
        CONFIG environment variable before running the script:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        set CONFIG=
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Now you can compile Perl. Type:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        make

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Building_Prerequisites_for_Perl_on_"><a class="permalink" href="#Building_Prerequisites_for_Perl_on_">Building
  Prerequisites for Perl on DOS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">For building and installing non-XS modules, all you need is a
    working perl under DJGPP. Non-XS modules do not require re-linking the perl
    binary, and so are simpler to build and install.</p>
<p class="Pp">XS-type modules do require re-linking the perl binary, because
    part of an XS module is written in &quot;C&quot;, and has to be linked
    together with the perl binary to be executed. This is required because perl
    under DJGPP is built with the &quot;static link&quot; option, due to the
    lack of &quot;dynamic linking&quot; in the DJGPP environment.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because XS modules require re-linking of the perl binary, you need
    both the perl binary distribution and the perl source distribution to build
    an XS extension module. In addition, you will have to have built your perl
    binary from the source distribution so that all of the components of the
    perl binary are available for the required link step.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Unpacking_"><a class="permalink" href="#Unpacking_">Unpacking
  CPAN Modules on DOS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">First, download the module package from CPAN (e.g., the
    &quot;Comma Separated Value&quot; text package, Text-CSV-0.01.tar.gz). Then
    expand the contents of the package into some location on your disk. Most
    CPAN modules are built with an internal directory structure, so it is
    usually safe to expand it in the root of your DJGPP installation. Some
    people prefer to locate source trees under /usr/src (i.e.,
    <span class="Li">&quot;($DJDIR)/usr/src&quot;</span>), but you may put it
    wherever seems most logical to you, *EXCEPT* under the same directory as
    your perl source code. There are special rules that apply to modules which
    live in the perl source tree that do not apply to most of the modules in
    CPAN.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike other DJGPP packages, which are normal &quot;zip&quot;
    files, most CPAN module packages are &quot;gzipped tarballs&quot;. Recent
    versions of WinZip will safely unpack and expand them, *UNLESS* they have
    zero-length files. It is a known WinZip bug (as of v7.0) that it will not
    extract zero-length files.</p>
<p class="Pp">From the command line, you can use the djtar utility provided with
    DJGPP to unpack and expand these files. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        C:\djgpp&gt;djtarx -v Text-CSV-0.01.tar.gz
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will create the new directory
    <span class="Li">&quot;($DJDIR)/Text-CSV-0.01&quot;</span>, filling it with
    the source for this module.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Building_Non-XS_Modules_on_"><a class="permalink" href="#Building_Non-XS_Modules_on_">Building
  Non-XS Modules on DOS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">To build a non-XS module, you can use the standard module-building
    instructions distributed with perl modules.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is sufficient because non-XS modules install only
    &quot;.pm&quot; files and (sometimes) pod and/or man documentation. No
    re-linking of the perl binary is needed to build, install or use non-XS
    modules.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Building_"><a class="permalink" href="#Building_">Building XS
  Modules on DOS</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">To build an XS module, you must use the standard module-building
    instructions distributed with perl modules *PLUS* three extra instructions
    specific to the DJGPP &quot;static link&quot; build environment.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    set FNCASE=y
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make perl
    make test
    make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl MAP_TARGET=perl.exe
    make install
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first extra instruction sets DJGPP's FNCASE environment
    variable so that the new perl binary which you must build for an XS-type
    module will build correctly. The second extra instruction re-builds the perl
    binary in your module directory before you run &quot;make test&quot;, so
    that you are testing with the new module code you built with
    &quot;make&quot;. The third extra instruction installs the perl binary from
    your module directory into the standard DJGPP binary directory,
    <span class="Li">&quot;($DJDIR)/bin&quot;</span>, replacing your previous
    perl binary.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the MAP_TARGET value *must* have the &quot;.exe&quot;
    extension or you will not create a &quot;perl.exe&quot; to replace the one
    in <span class="Li">&quot;($DJDIR)/bin&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you are done, the XS-module install process will have added
    information to your &quot;perllocal&quot; information telling that the perl
    binary has been replaced, and what module was installed. You can view this
    information at any time by using the command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        perl -S perldoc perllocal
