<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLE_OF_A_SIMPLE_PATCH"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLE_OF_A_SIMPLE_PATCH">EXAMPLE
  OF A SIMPLE PATCH</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Let's take a simple patch from start to finish.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's something Larry suggested: if a
    <span class="Li">&quot;U&quot;</span> is the first active format during a
    <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span>, (for example,
    <span class="Li">&quot;pack &quot;U3C8&quot;, @stuff&quot;</span>) then the
    resulting string should be treated as UTF-8 encoded.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are working with a git clone of the Perl repository, you
    will want to create a branch for your changes. This will make creating a
    proper patch much simpler. See the perlgit for details on how to do
  this.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Writing_the_patch"><a class="permalink" href="#Writing_the_patch">Writing
  the patch</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">How do we prepare to fix this up? First we locate the code in
    question - the <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span> happens at runtime,
    so it's going to be in one of the <i>pp</i> files. Sure enough,
    <span class="Li">&quot;pp_pack&quot;</span> is in <i>pp.c</i>. Since we're
    going to be altering this file, let's copy it to <i>pp.c~</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">[Well, it was in <i>pp.c</i> when this tutorial was written. It
    has now been split off with <span class="Li">&quot;pp_unpack&quot;</span> to
    its own file, <i>pp_pack.c</i>]</p>
<p class="Pp">Now let's look over <span class="Li">&quot;pp_pack&quot;</span>:
    we take a pattern into <span class="Li">&quot;pat&quot;</span>, and then
    loop over the pattern, taking each format character in turn into
    <span class="Li">&quot;datum_type&quot;</span>. Then for each possible
    format character, we swallow up the other arguments in the pattern (a field
    width, an asterisk, and so on) and convert the next chunk input into the
    specified format, adding it onto the output SV
    <span class="Li">&quot;cat&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">How do we know if the <span class="Li">&quot;U&quot;</span> is the
    first format in the <span class="Li">&quot;pat&quot;</span>? Well, if we
    have a pointer to the start of <span class="Li">&quot;pat&quot;</span> then,
    if we see a <span class="Li">&quot;U&quot;</span> we can test whether we're
    still at the start of the string. So, here's where
    <span class="Li">&quot;pat&quot;</span> is set up:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    STRLEN fromlen;
    char *pat = SvPVx(*++MARK, fromlen);
    char *patend = pat + fromlen;
    I32 len;
    I32 datumtype;
    SV *fromstr;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We'll have another string pointer in there:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    STRLEN fromlen;
    char *pat = SvPVx(*++MARK, fromlen);
    char *patend = pat + fromlen;
 +  char *patcopy;
    I32 len;
    I32 datumtype;
    SV *fromstr;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And just before we start the loop, we'll set
    <span class="Li">&quot;patcopy&quot;</span> to be the start of
    <span class="Li">&quot;pat&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    items = SP - MARK;
    MARK++;
    SvPVCLEAR(cat);
 +  patcopy = pat;
    while (pat &lt; patend) {
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now if we see a <span class="Li">&quot;U&quot;</span> which was at
    the start of the string, we turn on the
    <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8&quot;</span> flag for the output SV,
    <span class="Li">&quot;cat&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> +  if (datumtype == 'U' &amp;&amp; pat==patcopy+1)
 +      SvUTF8_on(cat);
    if (datumtype == '#') {
        while (pat &lt; patend &amp;&amp; *pat != '\n')
            pat++;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Remember that it has to be
    <span class="Li">&quot;patcopy+1&quot;</span> because the first character of
    the string is the <span class="Li">&quot;U&quot;</span> which has been
    swallowed into <span class="Li">&quot;datumtype!&quot;</span></p>
<p class="Pp">Oops, we forgot one thing: what if there are spaces at the start
    of the pattern? <span class="Li">&quot;pack(&quot; U*&quot;,
    @stuff)&quot;</span> will have <span class="Li">&quot;U&quot;</span> as the
    first active character, even though it's not the first thing in the pattern.
    In this case, we have to advance <span class="Li">&quot;patcopy&quot;</span>
    along with <span class="Li">&quot;pat&quot;</span> when we see spaces:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    if (isSPACE(datumtype))
        continue;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">needs to become</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    if (isSPACE(datumtype)) {
        patcopy++;
        continue;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">OK. That's the C part done. Now we must do two additional things
    before this patch is ready to go: we've changed the behaviour of Perl, and
    so we must document that change. We must also provide some more regression
    tests to make sure our patch works and doesn't create a bug somewhere else
    along the line.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Testing_the_patch"><a class="permalink" href="#Testing_the_patch">Testing
  the patch</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The regression tests for each operator live in <i>t/op/</i>, and
    so we make a copy of <i>t/op/pack.t</i> to <i>t/op/pack.t~</i>. Now we can
    add our tests to the end. First, we'll test that the
    <span class="Li">&quot;U&quot;</span> does indeed create Unicode
  strings.</p>
<p class="Pp">t/op/pack.t has a sensible <b>ok()</b> function, but if it didn't
    we could use the one from t/test.pl.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> require './test.pl';
 plan( tests =&gt; 159 );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">so instead of this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> print 'not ' unless &quot;1.20.300.4000&quot; eq sprintf &quot;%vd&quot;,
                                               pack(&quot;U*&quot;,1,20,300,4000);
 print &quot;ok $test\n&quot;; $test++;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">we can write the more sensible (see Test::More for a full
    explanation of <b>is()</b> and other testing functions).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> is( &quot;1.20.300.4000&quot;, sprintf &quot;%vd&quot;, pack(&quot;U*&quot;,1,20,300,4000),
                                       &quot;U* produces Unicode&quot; );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now we'll test that we got that space-at-the-beginning business
    right:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> is( &quot;1.20.300.4000&quot;, sprintf &quot;%vd&quot;, pack(&quot;  U*&quot;,1,20,300,4000),
                                     &quot;  with spaces at the beginning&quot; );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And finally we'll test that we don't make Unicode strings if
    <span class="Li">&quot;U&quot;</span> is <b>not</b> the first active
  format:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> isnt( v1.20.300.4000, sprintf &quot;%vd&quot;, pack(&quot;C0U*&quot;,1,20,300,4000),
                                       &quot;U* not first isn't Unicode&quot; );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Mustn't forget to change the number of tests which appears at the
    top, or else the automated tester will get confused. This will either look
    like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> print &quot;1..156\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> plan( tests =&gt; 156 );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We now compile up Perl, and run it through the test suite. Our new
    tests pass, hooray!</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Documenting_the_patch"><a class="permalink" href="#Documenting_the_patch">Documenting
  the patch</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Finally, the documentation. The job is never done until the
    paperwork is over, so let's describe the change we've just made. The
    relevant place is <i>pod/perlfunc.pod</i>; again, we make a copy, and then
    we'll insert this text in the description of
    <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> =item *
 If the pattern begins with a C&lt;U&gt;, the resulting string will be treated
 as UTF-8-encoded Unicode. You can force UTF-8 encoding on in a string
 with an initial C&lt;U0&gt;, and the bytes that follow will be interpreted as
 Unicode characters. If you don't want this to happen, you can begin
 your pattern with C&lt;C0&gt; (or anything else) to force Perl not to UTF-8
 encode your string, and then follow this with a C&lt;U*&gt; somewhere in your
 pattern.
