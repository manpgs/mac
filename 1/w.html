<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">w</code> utility prints a summary of the
    current activity on the system, including what each user is doing. The first
    line displays the current time of day, how long the system has been running,
    the number of users logged into the system, and the load averages. The load
    average numbers give the number of jobs in the run queue averaged over 1, 5
    and 15 minutes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The fields output are the user's login name, the name of the
    terminal the user is on, the host from which the user is logged in, the time
    the user logged on, the time since the user last typed anything, and the
    name and arguments of the current process.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="libxo"><a class="permalink" href="#libxo"><code class="Fl">--libxo</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Generate output via <a class="Xr" href="../3/libxo">libxo(3)</a> in a
      selection of different human and machine readable formats. See
      <a class="Xr" href="../3/xo_parse_args">xo_parse_args(3)</a> for details
      on command line arguments.</dd>

  <dd>Suppress the heading.</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><code class="Fl">-i</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Output is sorted by idle time.</dd>
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><code class="Fl">-n</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not attempt to resolve network addresses (normally
      <code class="Nm">w</code> interprets addresses and attempts to display
      them as names). When <code class="Fl">-n</code> is specified more than
      once, hostnames stored in utmp are attempted to resolve to display them as
      network addresses.</dd>

<p class="Pp">If one or more <var class="Ar">user</var> names are specified, the
    output is restricted to those users.</p>

<p class="Pp">The notion of the &#x201C;current process&#x201D; is muddy. The
    current algorithm is &#x201C;the highest numbered process on the terminal
    that is not ignoring interrupts, or, if there is none, the highest numbered
    process on the terminal&#x201D;. This fails, for example, in critical
    sections of programs like the shell and editor, or when faulty programs
    running in the background fork and fail to ignore interrupts. (In cases
    where no process can be found, <code class="Nm">w</code> prints
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">-</code>&#x2019;.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The CPU time is only an estimate, in particular, if someone leaves
    a background process running after logging out, the person currently on that
    terminal is &#x201C;charged&#x201D; with the time.</p>
<p class="Pp">Background processes are not shown, even though they account for
    much of the load on the system.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes processes, typically those in the background, are
    printed with null or garbaged arguments. In these cases, the name of the
    command is printed in parentheses.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">w</code> utility does not know about the new
    conventions for detection of background jobs. It will sometimes find a
    background job instead of the right one.</p>
<p class="Pp">Long hostnames and IPv6 addresses may be truncated.</p>
