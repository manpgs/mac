<p class="Pp">Some workflows require that one or more branches of development on
    one machine be replicated on another machine, but the two machines cannot be
    directly connected, and therefore the interactive Git protocols (git, ssh,
    http) cannot be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>git bundle</i> command packages objects and references in
    an archive at the originating machine, which can then be imported into
    another repository using <i>git fetch</i>, <i>git pull</i>, or <i>git
    clone</i>, after moving the archive by some means (e.g., by sneakernet).</p>
<p class="Pp">As no direct connection between the repositories exists, the user
    must specify a basis for the bundle that is held by the destination
    repository: the bundle assumes that all objects in the basis are already in
    the destination repository.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">create [options] &lt;file&gt; &lt;git-rev-list-args&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Used to create a bundle named <i>file</i>. This requires
  the <i>&lt;git-rev-list-args&gt;</i> arguments to define the bundle contents.
  <i>options</i> contains the options specific to the <i>git bundle create</i>
  subcommand.</div>
<p class="Pp">verify &lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Used to check that a bundle file is valid and will apply
  cleanly to the current repository. This includes checks on the bundle format
  itself as well as checking that the prerequisite commits exist and are fully
  linked in the current repository. <i>git bundle</i> prints a list of missing
  commits, if any, and exits with a non-zero status.</div>
<p class="Pp">list-heads &lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Lists the references defined in the bundle. If followed
  by a list of references, only references matching those given are printed
  out.</div>
<p class="Pp">unbundle &lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Passes the objects in the bundle to <i>git index-pack</i>
  for storage in the repository, then prints the names of all defined
  references. If a list of references is given, only references matching those
  in the list are printed. This command is really plumbing, intended to be
  called only by <i>git fetch</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;git-rev-list-args&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A list of arguments, acceptable to <i>git rev-parse</i>
  and <i>git rev-list</i> (and containing a named ref, see SPECIFYING REFERENCES
  below), that specifies the specific objects and references to transport. For
  example, <b>master~10..master</b> causes the current master reference to be
  packaged along with all objects added since its 10th ancestor commit. There is
  no explicit limit to the number of references and objects that may be
  packaged.</div>
<p class="Pp">[&lt;refname&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A list of references used to limit the references
  reported as available. This is principally of use to <i>git fetch</i>, which
  expects to receive only those references asked for and not necessarily
  everything in the pack (in this case, <i>git bundle</i> acts like <i>git
  fetch-pack</i>).</div>
<p class="Pp">--progress</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Progress status is reported on the standard error stream
  by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is specified. This
  flag forces progress status even if the standard error stream is not directed
  to a terminal.</div>
<p class="Pp">--all-progress</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When --stdout is specified then progress report is
  displayed during the object count and compression phases but inhibited during
  the write-out phase. The reason is that in some cases the output stream is
  directly linked to another command which may wish to display progress status
  of its own as it processes incoming pack data. This flag is like --progress
  except that it forces progress report for the write-out phase as well even if
  --stdout is used.</div>
<p class="Pp">--all-progress-implied</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is used to imply --all-progress whenever progress
  display is activated. Unlike --all-progress this flag doesn&#x2019;t actually
  force any progress display by itself.</div>
<p class="Pp">--version=&lt;version&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the bundle version. Version 2 is the older format
  and can only be used with SHA-1 repositories; the newer version 3 contains
  capabilities that permit extensions. The default is the oldest supported
  format, based on the hash algorithm in use.</div>
<p class="Pp">-q, --quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This flag makes the command not to report its progress on
  the standard error stream.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SPECIFYING_REFERENCES"><a class="permalink" href="#SPECIFYING_REFERENCES">SPECIFYING
  REFERENCES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>git bundle</i> will only package references that are shown by
    <i>git show-ref</i>: this includes heads, tags, and remote heads. References
    such as <b>master~1</b> cannot be packaged, but are perfectly suitable for
    defining the basis. More than one reference may be packaged, and more than
    one basis can be specified. The objects packaged are those not contained in
    the union of the given bases. Each basis can be specified explicitly (e.g.
    <b>^master~10</b>), or implicitly (e.g. <b>master~10..master</b>,
    <b>--since=10.days.ago master</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">It is very important that the basis used be held by the
    destination. It is okay to err on the side of caution, causing the bundle
    file to contain objects already in the destination, as these are ignored
    when unpacking at the destination.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git clone</b> can use any bundle created without negative
    refspecs (e.g., <b>new</b>, but not <b>old..new</b>). If you want to match
    <b>git clone --mirror</b>, which would include your refs such as
    <b>refs/remotes/*</b>, use <b>--all</b>. If you want to provide the same set
    of refs that a clone directly from the source repository would get, use
    <b>--branches --tags</b> for the <b>&lt;git-rev-list-args&gt;</b>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Assume you want to transfer the history from a repository R1 on
    machine A to another repository R2 on machine B. For whatever reason, direct
    connection between A and B is not allowed, but we can move data from A to B
    via some mechanism (CD, email, etc.). We want to update R2 with development
    made on the branch master in R1.</p>
<p class="Pp">To bootstrap the process, you can first create a bundle that does
    not have any basis. You can use a tag to remember up to what commit you last
    processed, in order to make it easy to later update the other repository
    with an incremental bundle:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
machineA$ cd R1
machineA$ git bundle create file.bundle master
machineA$ git tag -f lastR2bundle master
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Then you transfer file.bundle to the target machine B. Because
    this bundle does not require any existing object to be extracted, you can
    create a new repository on machine B by cloning from it:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
machineB$ git clone -b master /home/me/tmp/file.bundle R2
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This will define a remote called &quot;origin&quot; in the
    resulting repository that lets you fetch and pull from the bundle. The
    $GIT_DIR/config file in R2 will have an entry like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
    url = /home/me/tmp/file.bundle
    fetch = refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">To update the resulting mine.git repository, you can fetch or pull
    after replacing the bundle stored at /home/me/tmp/file.bundle with
    incremental updates.</p>
<p class="Pp">After working some more in the original repository, you can create
    an incremental bundle to update the other repository:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
machineA$ cd R1
machineA$ git bundle create file.bundle lastR2bundle..master
machineA$ git tag -f lastR2bundle master
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">You then transfer the bundle to the other machine to replace
    /home/me/tmp/file.bundle, and pull from it.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
machineB$ cd R2
machineB$ git pull
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">If you know up to what commit the intended recipient repository
    should have the necessary objects, you can use that knowledge to specify the
    basis, giving a cut-off point to limit the revisions and objects that go in
    the resulting bundle. The previous example used the lastR2bundle tag for
    this purpose, but you can use any other options that you would give to the
    <b>git-log</b>(1) command. Here are more examples:</p>
<p class="Pp">You can use a tag that is present in both:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git bundle create mybundle v1.0.0..master
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">You can use a basis based on time:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git bundle create mybundle --since=10.days master
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">You can use the number of commits:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git bundle create mybundle -10 master
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">You can run <b>git-bundle verify</b> to see if you can extract
    from a bundle that was created with a basis:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git bundle verify mybundle
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This will list what commits you must have in order to extract from
    the bundle and will error out if you do not have them.</p>
<p class="Pp">A bundle from a recipient repository&#x2019;s point of view is
    just like a regular repository which it fetches or pulls from. You can, for
    example, map references when fetching:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git fetch mybundle master:localRef
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">You can also see what references it offers:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git ls-remote mybundle
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
