<p class="Pp">The purpose of this document is to document what has been
    deprecated in Perl, and by which version the deprecated feature will
    disappear, or, for already removed features, when it was removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">This document will try to discuss what alternatives for the
    deprecated features are available.</p>
<p class="Pp">The deprecated features will be grouped by the version of Perl in
    which they will be removed.</p>

  5.32</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><i>Constants from lexical variables potentially modified
    elsewhere</i></p>
<p class="Pp">You wrote something like</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $var;
    $sub = sub () { $var };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">but <span class="Li">$var</span> is referenced elsewhere and could
    be modified after the <span class="Li">&quot;sub&quot;</span> expression is
    evaluated. Either it is explicitly modified elsewhere
    (<span class="Li">&quot;$var = 3&quot;</span>) or it is passed to a
    subroutine or to an operator like <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span>
    or <span class="Li">&quot;map&quot;</span>, which may or may not modify the
    variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Traditionally, Perl has captured the value of the variable at that
    point and turned the subroutine into a constant eligible for inlining. In
    those cases where the variable can be modified elsewhere, this breaks the
    behavior of closures, in which the subroutine captures the variable itself,
    rather than its value, so future changes to the variable are reflected in
    the subroutine's return value.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you intended for the subroutine to be eligible for inlining,
    then make sure the variable is not referenced elsewhere, possibly by copying
    it:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $var2 = $var;
    $sub = sub () { $var2 };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you do want this subroutine to be a closure that reflects
    future changes to the variable that it closes over, add an explicit
    <span class="Li">&quot;return&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $var;
    $sub = sub () { return $var };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This usage was deprecated and as of Perl 5.32 is no longer
    allowed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Use of strings with code points over 0xFF as arguments to
    </i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;vec&quot;</i></span><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;vec&quot;</span> views its string argument
    as a sequence of bits. A string containing a code point over 0xFF is
    nonsensical. This usage is deprecated in Perl 5.28, and was removed in Perl
    5.32.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Use of code points over 0xFF in string bitwise
  operators</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The string bitwise operators,
    <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;~&quot;</span>, treat their operands as strings of
    bytes. As such, values above 0xFF are nonsensical. Some instances of these
    have been deprecated since Perl 5.24, and were made fatal in 5.28, but it
    turns out that in cases where the wide characters did not affect the end
    result, no deprecation notice was raised, and so remain legal. Now, all
    occurrences either are fatal or raise a deprecation warning, so that the
    remaining legal occurrences became fatal in 5.32.</p>
<p class="Pp">An example of this is</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> &quot;&quot; &amp; &quot;\x{100}&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The wide character is not used in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span> operation because the left operand
    is shorter. This now throws an exception.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><b><i>hostname()</i></b><i> doesn't accept any
    arguments</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The function <span class="Li">&quot;hostname()&quot;</span> in the
    Sys::Hostname module has always been documented to be called with no
    arguments. Historically it has not enforced this, and has actually accepted
    and ignored any arguments. As a result, some users have got the mistaken
    impression that an argument does something useful. To avoid these bugs, the
    function is being made strict. Passing arguments was deprecated in Perl 5.28
    and became fatal in Perl 5.32.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Unescaped left braces in regular expressions</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The simple rule to remember, if you want to match a literal
    <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> character (U+007B
    <span class="Li">&quot;LEFT CURLY BRACKET&quot;</span>) in a regular
    expression pattern, is to escape each literal instance of it in some way.
    Generally easiest is to precede it with a backslash, like
    <span class="Li">&quot;\{&quot;</span> or enclose it in square brackets
    (<span class="Li">&quot;[{]&quot;</span>). If the pattern delimiters are
    also braces, any matching right brace
    (<span class="Li">&quot;}&quot;</span>) should also be escaped to avoid
    confusing the parser, for example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> qr{abc\{def\}ghi}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Forcing literal <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> characters
    to be escaped will enable the Perl language to be extended in various ways
    in future releases. To avoid needlessly breaking existing code, the
    restriction is not enforced in contexts where there are unlikely to ever be
    extensions that could conflict with the use there of
    <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> as a literal. A non-deprecation
    warning that the left brace is being taken literally is raised in contexts
    where there could be confusion about it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Literal uses of <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> were
    deprecated in Perl 5.20, and some uses of it started to give deprecation
    warnings since. These cases were made fatal in Perl 5.26. Due to an
    oversight, not all cases of a use of a literal
    <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> got a deprecation warning. Some cases
    started warning in Perl 5.26, and were made fatal in Perl 5.30. Other cases
    started in Perl 5.28, and were made fatal in 5.32.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>In XS code, use of various macros dealing with UTF-8.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The macros below now require an extra parameter than in versions
    prior to Perl 5.32. The final parameter in each one is a pointer into the
    string supplied by the first parameter beyond which the input will not be
    read. This prevents potential reading beyond the end of the buffer.
    <span class="Li">&quot;isALPHANUMERIC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isASCII_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isBLANK_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isCNTRL_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isDIGIT_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isIDFIRST_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isPSXSPC_utf8&quot;</span>,

    <span class="Li">&quot;isALPHA_LC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isASCII_LC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isBLANK_LC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isCNTRL_LC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isDIGIT_LC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isGRAPH_LC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isIDCONT_LC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isIDFIRST_LC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isLOWER_LC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isPRINT_LC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isPSXSPC_LC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isPUNCT_LC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isSPACE_LC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isUPPER_LC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isWORDCHAR_LC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;isXDIGIT_LC_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;toFOLD_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;toLOWER_utf8&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;toTITLE_utf8&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;toUPPER_utf8&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Perl 5.26, this functionality with the extra parameter has
    been available by using a corresponding macro to each one of these, and
    whose name is formed by appending <span class="Li">&quot;_safe&quot;</span>
    to the base name. There is no change to the functionality of those. For
    example, <span class="Li">&quot;isDIGIT_utf8_safe&quot;</span> corresponds
    to <span class="Li">&quot;isDIGIT_utf8&quot;</span>, and both now behave
    identically. All are documented in &quot;Character case changing&quot; in
    perlapi and &quot;Character classification&quot; in perlapi.</p>
<p class="Pp">This change was originally scheduled for 5.30, but was delayed
    until 5.32.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;File::Glob::glob()&quot;</i></span><i>
    was removed</i></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob&quot;</span> has a function
    called <span class="Li">&quot;glob&quot;</span>, which just calls
    <span class="Li">&quot;bsd_glob&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob::glob()&quot;</span> was
    deprecated in Perl 5.8. A deprecation message was issued from Perl 5.26
    onwards, and the function has now disappeared in Perl 5.30.</p>
<p class="Pp">Code using <span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob::glob()&quot;</span>

<p class="Pp"><i></i><span class="Li"><i>$*</i></span><i> is no longer
    supported</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Before Perl 5.10, setting <span class="Li">$*</span> to a true
    value globally enabled multi-line matching within a string. This relique
    from the past lost its special meaning in 5.10. Use of this variable will be
    a fatal error in Perl 5.30, freeing the variable up for a future special
    meaning.</p>
<p class="Pp">To enable multiline matching one should use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> regexp modifier (possibly in
    combination with <span class="Li">&quot;/s&quot;</span>). This can be set on
    a per match bases, or can be enabled per lexical scope (including a whole
    file) with <span class="Li">&quot;use re '/m'&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><span class="Li"><i>$#</i></span><i> is no longer
    supported</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This variable used to have a special meaning -- it could be used
    to control how numbers were formatted when printed. This seldom used
    functionality was removed in Perl 5.10. In order to free up the variable for
    a future special meaning, its use will be a fatal error in Perl 5.30.</p>
<p class="Pp">To specify how numbers are formatted when printed, one is advised
    to use <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span> instead.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Assigning non-zero to </i><span class="Li"><i>$[</i></span><i>

<p class="Pp">This variable (and the corresponding
    <span class="Li">&quot;array_base&quot;</span> feature and arybase module)
    allowed changing the base for array and string indexing operations.</p>
<p class="Pp">Setting this to a non-zero value has been deprecated since Perl
    5.12 and throws a fatal error as of Perl 5.30.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;File::Glob::glob()&quot;</i></span><i>

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob&quot;</span> has a function

    <span class="Li">&quot;bsd_glob&quot;</span>. However, its prototype is
    different from the prototype of
    <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::glob&quot;</span>, and hence,
    <span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob::glob&quot;</span> should not be used.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob::glob()&quot;</span> was
    deprecated in Perl 5.8. A deprecation message was issued from Perl 5.26
    onwards, and the function will disappear in Perl 5.30.</p>
<p class="Pp">Code using <span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob::glob()&quot;</span>
    should call <span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob()&quot;</span>
    instead.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Unescaped left braces in regular expressions (for 5.30)</i></p>
<p class="Pp">See &quot;Unescaped left braces in regular expressions&quot;
    above.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Unqualified
    </i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;dump()&quot;</i></span><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">Use of <span class="Li">&quot;dump()&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::dump()&quot;</span> was deprecated in Perl 5.8,
    and an unqualified <span class="Li">&quot;dump()&quot;</span> will no longer
    be available in Perl 5.30.</p>
<p class="Pp">See &quot;dump&quot; in perlfunc.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Using </i><b><i>my()</i></b><i> in false conditional.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">There has been a long-standing bug in Perl that causes a lexical
    variable not to be cleared at scope exit when its declaration includes a
    false conditional. Some people have exploited this bug to achieve a kind of
    static variable. To allow us to fix this bug, people should not be relying
    on this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead, it's recommended one uses
    <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span> variables to achieve the same
    effect:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use 5.10.0;
    sub count {state $counter; return ++ $counter}
    say count ();    # Prints 1
    say count ();    # Prints 2
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span> variables were
    introduced in Perl 5.10.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, you can achieve a similar static effect by
    declaring the variable in a separate block outside the function, e.g.,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    sub f { my $x if 0; return $x++ }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">becomes</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    { my $x; sub f { return $x++ } }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The use of <span class="Li">&quot;my()&quot;</span> in a false
    conditional has been deprecated in Perl 5.10, and became a fatal error in
    Perl 5.30.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Reading/writing bytes from/to :utf8 handles.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>sysread()</b>, <b>recv()</b>, <b>syswrite()</b> and
    <b>send()</b> operators are deprecated on handles that have the
    <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> layer, either explicitly, or
    implicitly, eg., with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;:encoding(UTF-16LE)&quot;</span> layer.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both <b>sysread()</b> and <b>recv()</b> currently use only the
    <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> flag for the stream, ignoring the
    actual layers. Since <b>sysread()</b> and <b>recv()</b> do no UTF-8
    validation they can end up creating invalidly encoded scalars.</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, <b>syswrite()</b> and <b>send()</b> use only the
    <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> flag, otherwise ignoring any
    layers. If the flag is set, both write the value UTF-8 encoded, even if the
    layer is some different encoding, such as the example above.</p>
<p class="Pp">Ideally, all of these operators would completely ignore the
    <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> state, working only with bytes,
    but this would result in silently breaking existing code. To avoid this a
    future version of perl will throw an exception when any of <b>sysread()</b>,
    <b>recv()</b>, <b>syswrite()</b> or <b>send()</b> are called on handle with
    the <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> layer.</p>
<p class="Pp">In Perl 5.30, it will no longer be possible to use
    <b>sysread()</b>, <b>recv()</b>, <b>syswrite()</b> or <b>send()</b> to read
    or send bytes from/to :utf8 handles.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Use of unassigned code point or non-standalone grapheme for a
    delimiter.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">A grapheme is what appears to a native-speaker of a language to be
    a character. In Unicode (and hence Perl) a grapheme may actually be several
    adjacent characters that together form a complete grapheme. For example,
    there can be a base character, like &quot;R&quot; and an accent, like a
    circumflex &quot;^&quot;, that appear to be a single character when
    displayed, with the circumflex hovering over the &quot;R&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.30, use of delimiters which are non-standalone
    graphemes is fatal, in order to move the language to be able to accept
    multi-character graphemes as delimiters.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also, as of Perl 5.30, delimiters which are unassigned code points
    but that may someday become assigned are prohibited. Otherwise, code that
    works today would fail to compile if the currently unassigned delimiter ends
    up being something that isn't a stand-alone grapheme. Because Unicode is
    never going to assign non-character code points, nor code points that are
    above the legal Unicode maximum, those can be delimiters.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Perl_5.28"><a class="permalink" href="#Perl_5.28">Perl
  5.28</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><i>Attributes
    </i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;:locked&quot;</i></span><i> and
    </i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;:unique&quot;</i></span><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">The attributes <span class="Li">&quot;:locked&quot;</span> (on
    code references) and <span class="Li">&quot;:unique&quot;</span> (on array,
    hash and scalar references) have had no effect since Perl 5.005 and Perl
    5.8.8 respectively. Their use has been deprecated since.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.28, these attributes are syntax errors. Since the
    attributes do not do anything, removing them from your code fixes the syntax
    error; and removing them will not influence the behaviour of your code.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Bare here-document terminators</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Perl has allowed you to use a bare here-document terminator to
    have the here-document end at the first empty line. This practise was
    deprecated in Perl 5.000; as of Perl 5.28, using a bare here-document
    terminator throws a fatal error.</p>
<p class="Pp">You are encouraged to use the explicitly quoted form if you wish
    to use an empty line as the terminator of the here-document:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  print &lt;&lt;&quot;&quot;;
    Print this line.
  # Previous blank line ends the here-document.
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Setting $/ to a reference to a non-positive integer</i></p>
<p class="Pp">You assigned a reference to a scalar to <span class="Li">$/</span>
    where the referenced item is not a positive integer. In older perls this
    <b>appeared</b> to work the same as setting it to
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> but was in fact internally
    different, less efficient and with very bad luck could have resulted in your
    file being split by a stringified form of the reference.</p>
<p class="Pp">In Perl 5.20.0 this was changed so that it would be <b>exactly</b>
    the same as setting <span class="Li">$/</span> to undef, with the exception
    that this warning would be thrown.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.28, setting <span class="Li">$/</span> to a reference
    of a non-positive integer throws a fatal error.</p>
<p class="Pp">You are recommended to change your code to set
    <span class="Li">$/</span> to <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>
    explicitly if you wish to slurp the file.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Limit on the value of Unicode code points.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Unicode only allows code points up to 0x10FFFF, but Perl allows
    much larger ones. Up till Perl 5.28, it was allowed to use code points
    exceeding the maximum value of an integer
    (<span class="Li">&quot;IV_MAX&quot;</span>). However, that did break the
    perl interpreter in some constructs, including causing it to hang in a few
    cases. The known problem areas were in
    <span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span>, regular expression pattern
    matching using quantifiers, as quote delimiters in
    <span class="Li">&quot;q</span><span class="Li"><i>X</i></span><span class="Li">...</span><span class="Li"><i>X</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    (where <i>X</i> is the <span class="Li">&quot;chr()&quot;</span> of a large
    code point), and as the upper limits in loops.</p>
<p class="Pp">The use of out of range code points was deprecated in Perl 5.24;
    as of Perl 5.28 using a code point exceeding
    <span class="Li">&quot;IV_MAX&quot;</span> throws a fatal error.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your code is to run on various platforms, keep in mind that the
    upper limit depends on the platform. It is much larger on 64-bit word sizes
    than 32-bit ones. For 32-bit integers,
    <span class="Li">&quot;IV_MAX&quot;</span> equals
    <span class="Li">0x7FFFFFFF</span>, for 64-bit integers,
    <span class="Li">&quot;IV_MAX&quot;</span> equals
    <span class="Li">0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Use of comma-less variable list in formats.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">It was allowed to use a list of variables in a format, without
    separating them with commas. This usage has been deprecated for a long time,
    and as of Perl 5.28, this throws a fatal error.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Use of
    </i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;\N{}&quot;</i></span><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">Use of <span class="Li">&quot;\N{}&quot;</span> with nothing
    between the braces was deprecated in Perl 5.24, and throws a fatal error as
    of Perl 5.28.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since such a construct is equivalent to using an empty string, you
    are recommended to remove such <span class="Li">&quot;\N{}&quot;</span>
    constructs.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Using the same symbol to open a filehandle and a
  dirhandle</i></p>
<p class="Pp">It used to be legal to use
    <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span> to associate both a filehandle
    and a dirhandle to the same symbol (glob or scalar). This idiom is likely to

<p class="Pp">Using the same symbol to
    <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span> a filehandle and a dirhandle

<p class="Pp">You should be using two different symbols instead.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>${^ENCODING} is no longer supported.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The special variable
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^ENCODING}&quot;</span> was used to implement the
    <span class="Li">&quot;encoding&quot;</span> pragma. Setting this variable
    to anything other than <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> was
    deprecated in Perl 5.22. Full deprecation of the variable happened in Perl
    5.25.3.</p>
<p class="Pp">Setting this variable to anything other than an undefined value
    throws a fatal error as of Perl 5.28.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;B::OP::terse&quot;</i></span><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">This method, which just calls
    <span class="Li">&quot;B::Concise::b_terse&quot;</span>, has been
    deprecated, and disappeared in Perl 5.28. Please use
    <span class="Li">&quot;B::Concise&quot;</span> instead.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Use of inherited AUTOLOAD for non-method
    </i><span class="Li"><i>%s::</i></span><i>%s() is no longer allowed</i></p>
<p class="Pp">As an (ahem) accidental feature,
    <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> subroutines were looked up as
    methods (using the <span class="Li">@ISA</span> hierarchy) even when the
    subroutines to be autoloaded were called as plain functions (e.g.
    <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::bar()&quot;</span>), not as methods (e.g.
    <span class="Li">&quot;Foo-&gt;bar()&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;$obj-&gt;bar()&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">This bug was deprecated in Perl 5.004, has been rectified in Perl
    5.28 by using method lookup only for methods'
    <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span>s.</p>
<p class="Pp">The simple rule is: Inheritance will not work when autoloading
    non-methods. The simple fix for old code is: In any module that used to
    depend on inheriting <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> for
    non-methods from a base class named
    <span class="Li">&quot;BaseClass&quot;</span>, execute
    <span class="Li">&quot;*AUTOLOAD = \&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD&quot;</span>
    during startup.</p>
<p class="Pp">In code that currently says <span class="Li">&quot;use AutoLoader;
    @ISA = qw(AutoLoader);&quot;</span> you should remove AutoLoader from
    <span class="Li">@ISA</span> and change <span class="Li">&quot;use
    AutoLoader;&quot;</span> to <span class="Li">&quot;use AutoLoader
    'AUTOLOAD';&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Use of code points over 0xFF in string bitwise
  operators</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The string bitwise operators,
    <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;~&quot;</span>, treat their operands as strings of
    bytes. As such, values above 0xFF are nonsensical. Using such code points
    with these operators was deprecated in Perl 5.24, and is fatal as of Perl
    5.28.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>In XS code, use of
    </i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;to_utf8_case()&quot;</i></span><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">This function has been removed as of Perl 5.28; instead convert to
    call the appropriate one of:

    used to be deprecated, as it allowed strange action at a distance like
    rewriting a pending exception in <span class="Li">$@</span>. Plans to
    rectify this have been scrapped, as users found that rewriting a pending
    exception is actually a useful feature, and not a bug.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl never issued a deprecation warning for this; the deprecation
    was by documentation policy only. But this deprecation has been lifted as of

<p class="Pp"><i>Malformed UTF-8 string in &quot;%s&quot;</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This message indicates a bug either in the Perl core or in XS

    or a digit. But the character was not encoded in legal UTF-8. The
    <span class="Li">%s</span> is replaced by a string that can be used by
