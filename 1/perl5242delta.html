  handling of '.' in @INC in base.pm</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The handling of (the removal of) <span class="Li">'.'</span> in
    <span class="Li">@INC</span> in base has been improved. This resolves some
    problematic behaviour in the approach taken in Perl 5.24.1, which is
    probably best described in the following two threads on the Perl 5 Porters
    mailing list:
    &lt;http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/08/msg238991.html&gt;,

  colons and relative paths in PATH</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">On Unix systems, Perl treats any relative paths in the PATH
    environment variable as tainted when starting a new process. Previously, it
    was allowing a backslash to escape a colon (unlike the OS), consequently
    allowing relative paths to be considered safe if the PATH was set to
    something like <span class="Li">&quot;/\:.&quot;</span>. The check has been
    fixed to treat <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> as tainted in that
    example.</p>

<p class="Pp">Perl 5.24.2 represents approximately 6 months of development since
    Perl 5.24.1 and contains approximately 2,500 lines of changes across 53
    files from 18 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 960 lines of changes to 17 .pm, .t, .c and .h
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.24.2:</p>
<p class="Pp">Aaron Crane, Abigail, Aristotle Pagaltzis, Chris 'BinGOs'
    Williams, Dan Collins, David Mitchell, Eric Herman, Father Chrysostomos,
    James E Keenan, Karl Williamson, Lukas Mai, Renee Baecker, Ricardo Signes,
    Sawyer X, Stevan Little, Steve Hay, Tony Cook, Yves Orton.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
    please see the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Reporting_Bugs"><a class="permalink" href="#Reporting_Bugs">Reporting
  Bugs</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
    recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
    database at &lt;https://rt.perl.org/&gt; . There may also be information at
    &lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt; , the Perl Home Page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
    &quot;SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION&quot; in perlsec for
    details of how to report the issue.</p>
