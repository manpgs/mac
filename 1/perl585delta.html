<p class="Pp">Perl's regular expression engine now contains support for matching
    on the intersection of two Unicode character classes. You can also now refer
    to user-defined character classes from within other user defined character
    classes.</p>

    inline functions -- basically, the inline functions that look like CPP
    macros. This has been introduced to deal with some of the headers of the
    newest versions of the glibc. The standard warning still applies; to quote
    <i>h2ph</i>'s documentation, <i>you may need to dicker with the files

  Bug Fixes</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The in-place sort optimisation introduced in 5.8.4 had a bug. For example,
      in code such as
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    @a = sort ($b, @a)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">the result would omit the value <span class="Li">$b</span>.
        This is now fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The optimisation for unnecessary assignments introduced in 5.8.4 could
      give spurious warnings. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>Perl should now correctly detect and read BOM-marked and (BOMless) UTF-16
      scripts of either endianness.</li>
  <li>Creating a new thread when weak references exist was buggy, and would
      often cause warnings at interpreter destruction time. The known bug is now
      fixed.</li>
  <li>Several obscure bugs involving manipulating Unicode strings with
      <span class="Li">&quot;substr&quot;</span> have been fixed.</li>
  <li>Previously if Perl's file globbing function encountered a directory that
      it did not have permission to open it would return immediately, leading to
      unexpected truncation of the list of results. This has been fixed, to be
      consistent with Unix shells' globbing behaviour.</li>
  <li>Thread creation time could vary wildly between identical runs. This was
      caused by a poor hashing algorithm in the thread cloning routines, which
      has now been fixed.</li>
  <li>The internals of the ithreads implementation were not checking if OS-level
      thread creation had failed. threads-&gt;<b>create()</b> now returns
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> in if thread creation fails
      instead of crashing perl.</li>

  <li>a trailing colon suppresses the linefeed and ';' terminator, allowing

<p class="Pp">The Unicode character class files used by the regular expression
    engine are now built at build time from the supplied Unicode consortium data
    files, instead of being shipped prebuilt. This makes the compressed Perl
    source tarball about 200K smaller. A side effect is that the layout of files
    inside lib/unicore has changed.</p>

<p class="Pp">If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
    recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
    database at http://bugs.perl.org. There may also be information at
    http://www.perl.org, the Perl Home Page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the
    <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug
    down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the
    output of <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team. You can browse and
    search the Perl 5 bugs at http://bugs.perl.org/</p>
