<p class="Pp">Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their
    histories diverged from the current branch) into the current branch. This
    command is used by <i>git pull</i> to incorporate changes from another
    repository and can be used by hand to merge changes from one branch into
    another.</p>
<p class="Pp">Assume the following history exists and the current branch is
    &quot;<b>master</b>&quot;:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          A---B---C topic
         /
    D---E---F---G master</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Then &quot;<b>git merge topic</b>&quot; will replay the changes
    made on the <b>topic</b> branch since it diverged from <b>master</b> (i.e.,
    <b>E</b>) until its current commit (<b>C</b>) on top of <b>master</b>, and
    record the result in a new commit along with the names of the two parent
    commits and a log message from the user describing the changes.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          A---B---C topic
         /         \
    D---E---F---G---H master</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The second syntax (&quot;<b>git merge --abort</b>&quot;) can only
    be run after the merge has resulted in conflicts. <i>git merge --abort</i>
    will abort the merge process and try to reconstruct the pre-merge state.
    However, if there were uncommitted changes when the merge started (and
    especially if those changes were further modified after the merge was
    started), <i>git merge --abort</i> will in some cases be unable to
    reconstruct the original (pre-merge) changes. Therefore:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Warning</b>: Running <i>git merge</i> with non-trivial
    uncommitted changes is discouraged: while possible, it may leave you in a
    state that is hard to back out of in the case of a conflict.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third syntax (&quot;<b>git merge --continue</b>&quot;) can
    only be run after the merge has resulted in conflicts.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">--commit, --no-commit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Perform the merge and commit the result. This option can
  be used to override --no-commit.
<p class="Pp">With --no-commit perform the merge and stop just before creating a
    merge commit, to give the user a chance to inspect and further tweak the
    merge result before committing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that fast-forward updates do not create a merge commit and
    therefore there is no way to stop those merges with --no-commit. Thus, if
    you want to ensure your branch is not changed or updated by the merge
    command, use --no-ff with --no-commit.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--edit, -e, --no-edit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Invoke an editor before committing successful mechanical
  merge to further edit the auto-generated merge message, so that the user can
  explain and justify the merge. The <b>--no-edit</b> option can be used to
  accept the auto-generated message (this is generally discouraged). The
  <b>--edit</b> (or <b>-e</b>) option is still useful if you are giving a draft
  message with the <b>-m</b> option from the command line and want to edit it in
  the editor.
<p class="Pp">Older scripts may depend on the historical behaviour of not
    allowing the user to edit the merge log message. They will see an editor
    opened when they run <b>git merge</b>. To make it easier to adjust such
    scripts to the updated behaviour, the environment variable
    <b>GIT_MERGE_AUTOEDIT</b> can be set to <b>no</b> at the beginning of
  them.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--cleanup=&lt;mode&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option determines how the merge message will be
  cleaned up before committing. See <b>git-commit</b>(1) for more details. In
  addition, if the <i>&lt;mode&gt;</i> is given a value of <b>scissors</b>,
  scissors will be appended to <b>MERGE_MSG</b> before being passed on to the
  commit machinery in the case of a merge conflict.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ff, --no-ff, --ff-only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies how a merge is handled when the merged-in
  history is already a descendant of the current history. <b>--ff</b> is the
  default unless merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag that is not
  stored in its natural place in the <b>refs/tags/</b> hierarchy, in which case
  <b>--no-ff</b> is assumed.
<p class="Pp">With <b>--ff</b>, when possible resolve the merge as a
    fast-forward (only update the branch pointer to match the merged branch; do
    not create a merge commit). When not possible (when the merged-in history is
    not a descendant of the current history), create a merge commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">With <b>--no-ff</b>, create a merge commit in all cases, even when
    the merge could instead be resolved as a fast-forward.</p>
<p class="Pp">With <b>--ff-only</b>, resolve the merge as a fast-forward when
    possible. When not possible, refuse to merge and exit with a non-zero
    status.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-S[&lt;keyid&gt;], --gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;], --no-gpg-sign</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">GPG-sign the resulting merge commit. The <b>keyid</b>
  argument is optional and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it
  must be stuck to the option without a space. <b>--no-gpg-sign</b> is useful to
  countermand both <b>commit.gpgSign</b> configuration variable, and earlier
  <b>--gpg-sign</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--log[=&lt;n&gt;], --no-log</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to branch names, populate the log message
  with one-line descriptions from at most &lt;n&gt; actual commits that are
  being merged. See also <b>git-fmt-merge-msg</b>(1).
<p class="Pp">With --no-log do not list one-line descriptions from the actual
    commits being merged.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--signoff, --no-signoff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Add a <b>Signed-off-by</b> trailer by the committer at
  the end of the commit log message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the
  project to which you&#x2019;re committing. For example, it may certify that
  the committer has the rights to submit the work under the project&#x2019;s
  license or agrees to some contributor representation, such as a Developer
  Certificate of Origin. (See <b>http://developercertificate.org</b> for the one
  used by the Linux kernel and Git projects.) Consult the documentation or
  leadership of the project to which you&#x2019;re contributing to understand
  how the signoffs are used in that project.
<p class="Pp">The --no-signoff option can be used to countermand an earlier
    --signoff option on the command line.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--stat, -n, --no-stat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show a diffstat at the end of the merge. The diffstat is
  also controlled by the configuration option merge.stat.
<p class="Pp">With -n or --no-stat do not show a diffstat at the end of the
    merge.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--squash, --no-squash</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Produce the working tree and index state as if a real
  merge happened (except for the merge information), but do not actually make a
  commit, move the <b>HEAD</b>, or record <b>$GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD</b> (to cause
  the next <b>git commit</b> command to create a merge commit). This allows you
  to create a single commit on top of the current branch whose effect is the
  same as merging another branch (or more in case of an octopus).
<p class="Pp">With --no-squash perform the merge and commit the result. This
    option can be used to override --squash.</p>
<p class="Pp">With --squash, --commit is not allowed, and will fail.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]verify</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, the pre-merge and commit-msg hooks are run.
  When <b>--no-verify</b> is given, these are bypassed. See also
  <b>githooks</b>(5).</div>
<p class="Pp">-s &lt;strategy&gt;, --strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use the given merge strategy; can be supplied more than
  once to specify them in the order they should be tried. If there is no
  <b>-s</b> option, a built-in list of strategies is used instead (<b>ort</b>
  when merging a single head, <b>octopus</b> otherwise).</div>
<p class="Pp">-X &lt;option&gt;, --strategy-option=&lt;option&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pass merge strategy specific option through to the merge
  strategy.</div>
<p class="Pp">--verify-signatures, --no-verify-signatures</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Verify that the tip commit of the side branch being
  merged is signed with a valid key, i.e. a key that has a valid uid: in the
  default trust model, this means the signing key has been signed by a trusted
  key. If the tip commit of the side branch is not signed with a valid key, the
  merge is aborted.</div>
<p class="Pp">--summary, --no-summary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonyms to --stat and --no-stat; these are deprecated
  and will be removed in the future.</div>
<p class="Pp">-q, --quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Operate quietly. Implies --no-progress.</div>
<p class="Pp">-v, --verbose</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Be verbose.</div>
<p class="Pp">--progress, --no-progress</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn progress on/off explicitly. If neither is specified,
  progress is shown if standard error is connected to a terminal. Note that not
  all merge strategies may support progress reporting.</div>
<p class="Pp">--autostash, --no-autostash</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Automatically create a temporary stash entry before the
  operation begins, record it in the special ref <b>MERGE_AUTOSTASH</b> and
  apply it after the operation ends. This means that you can run the operation
  on a dirty worktree. However, use with care: the final stash application after
  a successful merge might result in non-trivial conflicts.</div>
<p class="Pp">--allow-unrelated-histories</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, <b>git merge</b> command refuses to merge
  histories that do not share a common ancestor. This option can be used to
  override this safety when merging histories of two projects that started their
  lives independently. As that is a very rare occasion, no configuration
  variable to enable this by default exists and will not be added.</div>
<p class="Pp">-m &lt;msg&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the commit message to be used for the merge commit
  (in case one is created).
<p class="Pp">If <b>--log</b> is specified, a shortlog of the commits being
    merged will be appended to the specified message.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>git fmt-merge-msg</i> command can be used to give a good
    default for automated <i>git merge</i> invocations. The automated message
    can include the branch description.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--into-name &lt;branch&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prepare the default merge message as if merging to the
  branch <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>, instead of the name of the real branch to which
  the merge is made.</div>
<p class="Pp">-F &lt;file&gt;, --file=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Read the commit message to be used for the merge commit
  (in case one is created).
<p class="Pp">If <b>--log</b> is specified, a shortlog of the commits being
    merged will be appended to the specified message.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--rerere-autoupdate, --no-rerere-autoupdate</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">After the rerere mechanism reuses a recorded resolution
  on the current conflict to update the files in the working tree, allow it to
  also update the index with the result of resolution.
  <b>--no-rerere-autoupdate</b> is a good way to double-check what <b>rerere</b>
  did and catch potential mismerges, before committing the result to the index
  with a separate <b>git add</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--overwrite-ignore, --no-overwrite-ignore</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Silently overwrite ignored files from the merge result.
  This is the default behavior. Use <b>--no-overwrite-ignore</b> to abort.</div>
<p class="Pp">--abort</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Abort the current conflict resolution process, and try to
  reconstruct the pre-merge state. If an autostash entry is present, apply it to
  the worktree.
<p class="Pp">If there were uncommitted worktree changes present when the merge
    started, <i>git merge --abort</i> will in some cases be unable to
    reconstruct these changes. It is therefore recommended to always commit or
    stash your changes before running <i>git merge</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>git merge --abort</i> is equivalent to <i>git reset --merge</i>
    when <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> is present unless <b>MERGE_AUTOSTASH</b> is also
    present in which case <i>git merge --abort</i> applies the stash entry to
    the worktree whereas <i>git reset --merge</i> will save the stashed changes
    in the stash list.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--quit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Forget about the current merge in progress. Leave the
  index and the working tree as-is. If <b>MERGE_AUTOSTASH</b> is present, the
  stash entry will be saved to the stash list.</div>
<p class="Pp">--continue</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">After a <i>git merge</i> stops due to conflicts you can
  conclude the merge by running <i>git merge --continue</i> (see &quot;HOW TO
  RESOLVE CONFLICTS&quot; section below).</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;commit&gt;...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commits, usually other branch heads, to merge into our
  branch. Specifying more than one commit will create a merge with more than two
  parents (affectionately called an Octopus merge).
<p class="Pp">If no commit is given from the command line, merge the
    remote-tracking branches that the current branch is configured to use as its
    upstream. See also the configuration section of this manual page.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>FETCH_HEAD</b> (and no other commit) is specified, the
    branches recorded in the <b>.git/FETCH_HEAD</b> file by the previous
    invocation of <b>git fetch</b> for merging are merged to the current
  branch.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PRE"><a class="permalink" href="#PRE">PRE-MERGE
  CHECKS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Before applying outside changes, you should get your own work in
    good shape and committed locally, so it will not be clobbered if there are
    conflicts. See also <b>git-stash</b>(1). <i>git pull</i> and <i>git
    merge</i> will stop without doing anything when local uncommitted changes
    overlap with files that <i>git pull</i>/<i>git merge</i> may need to
  update.</p>
<p class="Pp">To avoid recording unrelated changes in the merge commit, <i>git
    pull</i> and <i>git merge</i> will also abort if there are any changes
    registered in the index relative to the <b>HEAD</b> commit. (Special narrow
    exceptions to this rule may exist depending on which merge strategy is in
    use, but generally, the index must match HEAD.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If all named commits are already ancestors of <b>HEAD</b>, <i>git
    merge</i> will exit early with the message &quot;Already up to
  date.&quot;</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FAST"><a class="permalink" href="#FAST">FAST-FORWARD
  MERGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Often the current branch head is an ancestor of the named commit.
    This is the most common case especially when invoked from <i>git pull</i>:
    you are tracking an upstream repository, you have committed no local
    changes, and now you want to update to a newer upstream revision. In this
    case, a new commit is not needed to store the combined history; instead, the
    <b>HEAD</b> (along with the index) is updated to point at the named commit,
    without creating an extra merge commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">This behavior can be suppressed with the <b>--no-ff</b>
  option.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TRUE_MERGE"><a class="permalink" href="#TRUE_MERGE">TRUE
  MERGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Except in a fast-forward merge (see above), the branches to be
    merged must be tied together by a merge commit that has both of them as its
    parents.</p>
<p class="Pp">A merged version reconciling the changes from all branches to be
    merged is committed, and your <b>HEAD</b>, index, and working tree are
    updated to it. It is possible to have modifications in the working tree as
    long as they do not overlap; the update will preserve them.</p>
<p class="Pp">When it is not obvious how to reconcile the changes, the following
    happens:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.The <b>HEAD</b> pointer stays the same.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.The <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> ref is set to point to the other
  branch head.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Paths that merged cleanly are updated both in the
  index file and in your working tree.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.For conflicting paths, the index file records up to
  three versions: stage 1 stores the version from the common ancestor, stage 2
  from <b>HEAD</b>, and stage 3 from <b>MERGE_HEAD</b> (you can inspect the
  stages with <b>git ls-files -u</b>). The working tree files contain the result
  of the &quot;merge&quot; program; i.e. 3-way merge results with familiar
  conflict markers <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;</b> <b>===</b> <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 5.No other changes are made. In particular, the local
  modifications you had before you started merge will stay the same and the
  index entries for them stay as they were, i.e. matching <b>HEAD</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">If you tried a merge which resulted in complex conflicts and want
    to start over, you can recover with <b>git merge --abort</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MERGING_TAG"><a class="permalink" href="#MERGING_TAG">MERGING
  TAG</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When merging an annotated (and possibly signed) tag, Git always
    creates a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge is possible, and the
    commit message template is prepared with the tag message. Additionally, if
    the tag is signed, the signature check is reported as a comment in the
    message template. See also <b>git-tag</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">When you want to just integrate with the work leading to the
    commit that happens to be tagged, e.g. synchronizing with an upstream
    release point, you may not want to make an unnecessary merge commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">In such a case, you can &quot;unwrap&quot; the tag yourself before
    feeding it to <b>git merge</b>, or pass <b>--ff-only</b> when you do not
    have any work on your own. e.g.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>git fetch origin
git merge v1.2.3^0
git merge --ff-only v1.2.3</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="HOW_CONFLICTS_ARE_PRESENTED"><a class="permalink" href="#HOW_CONFLICTS_ARE_PRESENTED">HOW
  CONFLICTS ARE PRESENTED</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">During a merge, the working tree files are updated to reflect the
    result of the merge. Among the changes made to the common ancestor&#x2019;s
    version, non-overlapping ones (that is, you changed an area of the file
    while the other side left that area intact, or vice versa) are incorporated
    in the final result verbatim. When both sides made changes to the same area,
    however, Git cannot randomly pick one side over the other, and asks you to
    resolve it by leaving what both sides did to that area.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, Git uses the same style as the one used by the
    &quot;merge&quot; program from the RCS suite to present such a conflicted
    hunk, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed,
or cleanly resolved because both sides changed the same way.
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt
Conflict resolution is hard;
let's go shopping.
=======
Git makes conflict resolution easy.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs:sample.txt
And here is another line that is cleanly resolved or unmodified.</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The area where a pair of conflicting changes happened is marked
    with markers <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</b>, <b>=======</b>, and
    <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</b>. The part before the <b>=======</b> is
    typically your side, and the part afterwards is typically their side.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default format does not show what the original said in the
    conflicting area. You cannot tell how many lines are deleted and replaced
    with Barbie&#x2019;s remark on your side. The only thing you can tell is
    that your side wants to say it is hard and you&#x2019;d prefer to go
    shopping, while the other side wants to claim it is easy.</p>
<p class="Pp">An alternative style can be used by setting the
    &quot;merge.conflictStyle&quot; configuration variable to either
    &quot;diff3&quot; or &quot;zdiff3&quot;. In &quot;diff3&quot; style, the
    above conflict may look like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>Here are lines that are either unchanged from the common
ancestor, or cleanly resolved because only one side changed,
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; yours:sample.txt

    another <b>|||||||</b> marker that is followed by the original text. You can
    tell that the original just stated a fact, and your side simply gave in to
    that statement and gave up, while the other side tried to have a more
    positive attitude. You can sometimes come up with a better resolution by

<p class="Pp">After seeing a conflict, you can do two things:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Decide not to merge. The only clean-ups you need
  are to reset the index file to the <b>HEAD</b> commit to reverse 2. and to

  be used for this.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Resolve the conflicts. Git will mark the
  conflicts in the working tree. Edit the files into shape and <i>git add</i>
  them to the index. Use <i>git commit</i> or <i>git merge --continue</i> to

<h1 class="Sh" id="MERGE_STRATEGIES"><a class="permalink" href="#MERGE_STRATEGIES">MERGE
  STRATEGIES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The merge mechanism (<b>git merge</b> and <b>git pull</b>
    commands) allows the backend <i>merge strategies</i> to be chosen with
    <b>-s</b> option. Some strategies can also take their own options, which can
    be passed by giving <b>-X&lt;option&gt;</b> arguments to <b>git merge</b>
    and/or <b>git pull</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">ort</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the default merge strategy when pulling or
  merging one branch. This strategy can only resolve two heads using a 3-way
  merge algorithm. When there is more than one common ancestor that can be used
  for 3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses
  that as the reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has been reported to
  result in fewer merge conflicts without causing mismerges by tests done on
  actual merge commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history.
  Additionally this strategy can detect and handle merges involving renames. It
  does not make use of detected copies. The name for this algorithm is an
  acronym (&quot;Ostensibly Recursive&#x2019;s Twin&quot;) and came from the
  fact that it was written as a replacement for the previous default algorithm,
  <b>recursive</b>.
<p class="Pp">The <i>ort</i> strategy can take the following options:</p>
<p class="Pp">ours</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option forces conflicting hunks to be auto-resolved
  cleanly by favoring <i>our</i> version. Changes from the other tree that do
  not conflict with our side are reflected in the merge result. For a binary
  file, the entire contents are taken from our side.
<p class="Pp">This should not be confused with the <i>ours</i> merge strategy,
    which does not even look at what the other tree contains at all. It discards
    everything the other tree did, declaring <i>our</i> history contains all
    that happened in it.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">theirs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the opposite of <i>ours</i>; note that, unlike
  <i>ours</i>, there is no <i>theirs</i> merge strategy to confuse this merge
  option with.</div>
<p class="Pp">ignore-space-change, ignore-all-space, ignore-space-at-eol,
    ignore-cr-at-eol</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Treats lines with the indicated type of whitespace change
  as unchanged for the sake of a three-way merge. Whitespace changes mixed with
  other changes to a line are not ignored. See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  <b>-b</b>, <b>-w</b>, <b>--ignore-space-at-eol</b>, and
  <b>--ignore-cr-at-eol</b>.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If <i>their</i> version only introduces
  whitespace changes to a line, <i>our</i> version is used;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If <i>our</i> version introduces whitespace
  changes but <i>their</i> version includes a substantial change, <i>their</i>
  version is used;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Otherwise, the merge proceeds in the usual
  way.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">renormalize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This runs a virtual check-out and check-in of all three
  stages of a file when resolving a three-way merge. This option is meant to be
  used when merging branches with different clean filters or end-of-line
  normalization rules. See &quot;Merging branches with differing
  checkin/checkout attributes&quot; in <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for
  details.</div>
<p class="Pp">no-renormalize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disables the <b>renormalize</b> option. This overrides
  the <b>merge.renormalize</b> configuration variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn on rename detection, optionally setting the
  similarity threshold. This is the default. This overrides the
  <i>merge.renames</i> configuration variable. See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  <b>--find-renames</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">rename-threshold=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deprecated synonym for
  <b>find-renames=&lt;n&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">subtree[=&lt;path&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is a more advanced form of <i>subtree</i>
  strategy, where the strategy makes a guess on how two trees must be shifted to
  match with each other when merging. Instead, the specified path is prefixed
  (or stripped from the beginning) to make the shape of two trees to
  match.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">recursive</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This can only resolve two heads using a 3-way merge
  algorithm. When there is more than one common ancestor that can be used for
  3-way merge, it creates a merged tree of the common ancestors and uses that as
  the reference tree for the 3-way merge. This has been reported to result in
  fewer merge conflicts without causing mismerges by tests done on actual merge
  commits taken from Linux 2.6 kernel development history. Additionally this can
  detect and handle merges involving renames. It does not make use of detected
  copies. This was the default strategy for resolving two heads from Git
  v0.99.9k until v2.33.0.
<p class="Pp">The <i>recursive</i> strategy takes the same options as
    <i>ort</i>. However, there are three additional options that <i>ort</i>
    ignores (not documented above) that are potentially useful with the
    <i>recursive</i> strategy:</p>
<p class="Pp">patience</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deprecated synonym for
  <b>diff-algorithm=patience</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff-algorithm=[patience|minimal|histogram|myers]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use a different diff algorithm while merging, which can
  help avoid mismerges that occur due to unimportant matching lines (such as
  braces from distinct functions). See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  <b>--diff-algorithm</b>. Note that <b>ort</b> specifically uses
  <b>diff-algorithm=histogram</b>, while <b>recursive</b> defaults to the
  <b>diff.algorithm</b> config setting.</div>
<p class="Pp">no-renames</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn off rename detection. This overrides the
  <b>merge.renames</b> configuration variable. See also <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  <b>--no-renames</b>.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">resolve</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This can only resolve two heads (i.e. the current branch
  and another branch you pulled from) using a 3-way merge algorithm. It tries to
  carefully detect criss-cross merge ambiguities. It does not handle
  renames.</div>
<p class="Pp">octopus</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This resolves cases with more than two heads, but refuses
  to do a complex merge that needs manual resolution. It is primarily meant to
  be used for bundling topic branch heads together. This is the default merge
  strategy when pulling or merging more than one branch.</div>
<p class="Pp">ours</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This resolves any number of heads, but the resulting tree
  of the merge is always that of the current branch head, effectively ignoring
  all changes from all other branches. It is meant to be used to supersede old
  development history of side branches. Note that this is different from the
  -Xours option to the <i>recursive</i> merge strategy.</div>
<p class="Pp">subtree</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is a modified <b>ort</b> strategy. When merging
  trees A and B, if B corresponds to a subtree of A, B is first adjusted to
  match the tree structure of A, instead of reading the trees at the same level.
  This adjustment is also done to the common ancestor tree.</div>
<p class="Pp">With the strategies that use 3-way merge (including the default,
    <i>ort</i>), if a change is made on both branches, but later reverted on one
    of the branches, that change will be present in the merged result; some
    people find this behavior confusing. It occurs because only the heads and
    the merge base are considered when performing a merge, not the individual
    commits. The merge algorithm therefore considers the reverted change as no
    change at all, and substitutes the changed version instead.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">branch.&lt;name&gt;.mergeOptions</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sets default options for merging into branch
  &lt;name&gt;. The syntax and supported options are the same as those of <i>git
  merge</i>, but option values containing whitespace characters are currently
  not supported.</div>
<p class="Pp">Everything above this line in this section isn&#x2019;t included
    from the <b>git-config</b>(1) documentation. The content that follows is the
    same as what&#x2019;s found there:</p>
<p class="Pp">merge.conflictStyle</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the style in which conflicted hunks are written
  out to working tree files upon merge. The default is &quot;merge&quot;, which
  shows a <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</b> conflict marker, changes made by
  one side, a <b>=======</b> marker, changes made by the other side, and then a
  <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</b> marker. An alternate style,
  &quot;diff3&quot;, adds a <b>|||||||</b> marker and the original text before
  the <b>=======</b> marker. The &quot;merge&quot; style tends to produce
  smaller conflict regions than diff3, both because of the exclusion of the
  original text, and because when a subset of lines match on the two sides they
  are just pulled out of the conflict region. Another alternate style,
  &quot;zdiff3&quot;, is similar to diff3 but removes matching lines on the two
  sides from the conflict region when those matching lines appear near either
  the beginning or end of a conflict region.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.defaultToUpstream</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If merge is called without any commit argument, merge the
  upstream branches configured for the current branch by using their last
  observed values stored in their remote-tracking branches. The values of the
  <b>branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.merge</b> that name the branches at the
  remote named by <b>branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.remote</b> are consulted, and
  then they are mapped via <b>remote.&lt;remote&gt;.fetch</b> to their
  corresponding remote-tracking branches, and the tips of these tracking
  branches are merged. Defaults to true.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.ff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit
  when merging a commit that is a descendant of the current commit. Instead, the
  tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded. When set to <b>false</b>, this
  variable tells Git to create an extra merge commit in such a case (equivalent
  to giving the <b>--no-ff</b> option from the command line). When set to
  <b>only</b>, only such fast-forward merges are allowed (equivalent to giving
  the <b>--ff-only</b> option from the command line).</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.verifySignatures</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, this is equivalent to the --verify-signatures
  command line option. See <b>git-merge</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.branchdesc</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to branch names, populate the log message
  with the branch description text associated with them. Defaults to
  false.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.log</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to branch names, populate the log message
  with at most the specified number of one-line descriptions from the actual
  commits that are being merged. Defaults to false, and true is a synonym for
  20.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.suppressDest</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By adding a glob that matches the names of integration
  branches to this multi-valued configuration variable, the default merge
  message computed for merges into these integration branches will omit
  &quot;into &lt;branch name&gt;&quot; from its title.
<p class="Pp">An element with an empty value can be used to clear the list of
    globs accumulated from previous configuration entries. When there is no
    <b>merge.suppressDest</b> variable defined, the default value of
    <b>master</b> is used for backward compatibility.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.renameLimit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The number of files to consider in the exhaustive portion
  of rename detection during a merge. If not specified, defaults to the value of
  diff.renameLimit. If neither merge.renameLimit nor diff.renameLimit are
  specified, currently defaults to 7000. This setting has no effect if rename
  detection is turned off.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.renames</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether Git detects renames. If set to &quot;false&quot;,
  rename detection is disabled. If set to &quot;true&quot;, basic rename
  detection is enabled. Defaults to the value of diff.renames.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.directoryRenames</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether Git detects directory renames, affecting what
  happens at merge time to new files added to a directory on one side of history
  when that directory was renamed on the other side of history. If
  merge.directoryRenames is set to &quot;false&quot;, directory rename detection
  is disabled, meaning that such new files will be left behind in the old
  directory. If set to &quot;true&quot;, directory rename detection is enabled,
  meaning that such new files will be moved into the new directory. If set to
  &quot;conflict&quot;, a conflict will be reported for such paths. If
  merge.renames is false, merge.directoryRenames is ignored and treated as
  false. Defaults to &quot;conflict&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.renormalize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Tell Git that canonical representation of files in the
  repository has changed over time (e.g. earlier commits record text files with
  CRLF line endings, but recent ones use LF line endings). In such a repository,
  Git can convert the data recorded in commits to a canonical form before
  performing a merge to reduce unnecessary conflicts. For more information, see
  section &quot;Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout
  attributes&quot; in <b>gitattributes</b>(5).</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.stat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether to print the diffstat between ORIG_HEAD and the
  merge result at the end of the merge. True by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.autoStash</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When set to true, automatically create a temporary stash
  entry before the operation begins, and apply it after the operation ends. This
  means that you can run merge on a dirty worktree. However, use with care: the
  final stash application after a successful merge might result in non-trivial
  conflicts. This option can be overridden by the <b>--no-autostash</b> and
  <b>--autostash</b> options of <b>git-merge</b>(1). Defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.tool</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Controls which merge tool is used by
  <b>git-mergetool</b>(1). The list below shows the valid built-in values. Any
  other value is treated as a custom merge tool and requires that a
  corresponding mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd variable is defined.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.guitool</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Controls which merge tool is used by
  <b>git-mergetool</b>(1) when the -g/--gui flag is specified. The list below
  shows the valid built-in values. Any other value is treated as a custom merge
  tool and requires that a corresponding mergetool.&lt;guitool&gt;.cmd variable
  is defined.
