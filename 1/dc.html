<p class="Pp">dc(1) is an arbitrary-precision calculator. It uses a stack
    (reverse Polish notation) to store numbers and results of computations.
    Arithmetic operations pop arguments off of the stack and push the
  results.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no files are given on the command-line as extra arguments
    (i.e., not as <b>-f</b> or <b>--file</b> arguments), then dc(1) reads from
    <b>stdin</b>. Otherwise, those files are processed, and dc(1) will then
    exit.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is different from the dc(1) on OpenBSD and possibly other
    dc(1) implementations, where <b>-e</b> (<b>--expression</b>) and <b>-f</b>
    (<b>--file</b>) arguments cause dc(1) to execute them and exit. The reason
    for this is that this dc(1) allows users to set arguments in the environment
    variable <b>DC_ENV_ARGS</b> (see the <b>ENVIRONMENT</b> <b>VARIABLES</b>
    section). Any expressions given on the command-line should be used to set up
    a standard environment. For example, if a user wants the <b>scale</b> always
    set to <b>10</b>, they can set <b>DC_ENV_ARGS</b> to <b>-e 10k</b>, and this
    dc(1) will always start with a <b>scale</b> of <b>10</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If users want to have dc(1) exit after processing all input from
    <b>-e</b> and <b>-f</b> arguments (and their equivalents), then they can
    just simply add <b>-e q</b> as the last command-line argument or define the
    environment variable <b>DC_EXPR_EXIT</b>.</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>ibase</b> is a register (see the <b>REGISTERS</b> section) that
    determines how to interpret constant numbers. It is the &quot;input&quot;

    <b>16</b>. The min allowable value for <b>ibase</b> is <b>2</b>. The max

<p class="Pp"><b>obase</b> is a register (see the <b>REGISTERS</b> section) that
    determines how to output results. It is the &quot;output&quot; base, or the
    number base used for outputting numbers. <b>obase</b> is initially
    <b>10</b>. The max allowable value for <b>obase</b> is <b>DC_BASE_MAX</b>
    and can be queried with the <b>U</b> command. The min allowable value for
    <b>obase</b> is <b>0</b>. If <b>obase</b> is <b>0</b>, values are output in
    scientific notation, and if <b>obase</b> is <b>1</b>, values are output in
    engineering notation. Otherwise, values are output in the specified
  base.</p>
<p class="Pp">Outputting in scientific and engineering notations are
    <b>non-portable</b> <b>extensions</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>scale</i> of an expression is the number of digits in the
    result of the expression right of the decimal point, and <b>scale</b> is a
    register (see the <b>REGISTERS</b> section) that sets the precision of any
    operations (with exceptions). <b>scale</b> is initially <b>0</b>.
    <b>scale</b> cannot be negative. The max allowable value for <b>scale</b>
    can be queried in dc(1) programs with the <b>V</b> command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>seed</b> is a register containing the current seed for the
    pseudo-random number generator. If the current value of <b>seed</b> is
    queried and stored, then if it is assigned to <b>seed</b> later, the
    pseudo-random number generator is guaranteed to produce the same sequence of
    pseudo-random numbers that were generated after the value of <b>seed</b> was
    first queried.</p>
<p class="Pp">Multiple values assigned to <b>seed</b> can produce the same
    sequence of pseudo-random numbers. Likewise, when a value is assigned to
    <b>seed</b>, it is not guaranteed that querying <b>seed</b> immediately
    after will return the same value. In addition, the value of <b>seed</b> will
    change after any call to the <b>'</b> command or the <b>&quot;</b> command
    that does not get receive a value of <b>0</b> or <b>1</b>. The maximum
    integer returned by the <b>'</b> command can be queried with the <b>W</b>
    command.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note</b>: The values returned by the pseudo-random number
    generator with the <b>'</b> and <b>&quot;</b> commands are guaranteed to
    <b>NOT</b> be cryptographically secure. This is a consequence of using a
    seeded pseudo-random number generator. However, they <i>are</i> guaranteed
    to be reproducible with identical <b>seed</b> values. This means that the
    pseudo-random values from dc(1) should only be used where a reproducible
    stream of pseudo-random numbers is <i>ESSENTIAL</i>. In any other case, use
    a non-seeded pseudo-random number generator.</p>

<p class="Pp">Numbers are strings made up of digits, uppercase letters up to
    <b>F</b>, and at most <b>1</b> period for a radix. Numbers can have up to
    <b>DC_NUM_MAX</b> digits. Uppercase letters are equal to <b>9</b> + their
    position in the alphabet (i.e., <b>A</b> equals <b>10</b>, or <b>9+1</b>).
    If a digit or letter makes no sense with the current value of <b>ibase</b>,
    they are set to the value of the highest valid digit in <b>ibase</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Single-character numbers (i.e., <b>A</b> alone) take the value
    that they would have if they were valid digits, regardless of the value of
    <b>ibase</b>. This means that <b>A</b> alone always equals decimal <b>10</b>
    and <b>F</b> alone always equals decimal <b>15</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, dc(1) accepts numbers in scientific notation. These
    have the form <b>&lt;number&gt;e&lt;integer&gt;</b>. The exponent (the
    portion after the <b>e</b>) must be an integer. An example is
    <b>1.89237e9</b>, which is equal to <b>1892370000</b>. Negative exponents
    are also allowed, so <b>4.2890e_3</b> is equal to <b>0.0042890</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>: Both the number and the exponent in scientific
    notation are interpreted according to the current <b>ibase</b>, but the
    number is still multiplied by <b>10^exponent</b> regardless of the current
    <b>ibase</b>. For example, if <b>ibase</b> is <b>16</b> and dc(1) is given
    the number string <b>FFeA</b>, the resulting decimal number will be
    <b>2550000000000</b>, and if dc(1) is given the number string <b>10e_4</b>,
    the resulting decimal number will be <b>0.0016</b>.</p>

If it is a string, then a new string is made. If the original string is

<p class="Pp">In non-extended register mode, a register name is just the single

<p class="Pp">In that case, the register name is found according to the regex

<p class="Pp">When dc(1) encounters an error or a signal that it has a

  happen.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, any macros that are executing are stopped and popped off
    the stack. The behavior is not unlike that of exceptions in programming
    languages. Then the execution point is set so that any code waiting to
    execute (after all macros returned) is skipped.</p>
<p class="Pp">Thus, when dc(1) resets, it skips any remaining code waiting to be
    executed. Then, if it is interactive mode, and the error was not a fatal
    error (see the <b>EXIT STATUS</b> section), it asks for more input;
    otherwise, it exits with the appropriate return code.</p>

<p class="Pp">Most dc(1) implementations use <b>char</b> types to calculate the
    value of <b>1</b> decimal digit at a time, but that can be slow. This dc(1)
    does something different.</p>
<p class="Pp">It uses large integers to calculate more than <b>1</b> decimal
    digit at a time. If built in a environment where <b>DC_LONG_BIT</b> (see the
    <b>LIMITS</b> section) is <b>64</b>, then each integer has <b>9</b> decimal
    digits. If built in an environment where <b>DC_LONG_BIT</b> is <b>32</b>
    then each integer has <b>4</b> decimal digits. This value (the number of
    decimal digits per large integer) is called <b>DC_BASE_DIGS</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, this dc(1) uses an even larger integer for overflow
    checking. This integer type depends on the value of <b>DC_LONG_BIT</b>, but
    is always at least twice as large as the integer type used to store
  digits.</p>

<p class="Pp">The following are the limits on dc(1):</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>DC_LONG_BIT</b></p>
<p class="Pp">: The number of bits in the <b>long</b> type in the environment
    where dc(1) was built. This determines how many decimal digits can be stored
    in a single large integer (see the <b>PERFORMANCE</b> section).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>DC_BASE_DIGS</b></p>
<p class="Pp">: The number of decimal digits per large integer (see the

<p class="Pp"><b>DC_BASE_POW</b></p>
<p class="Pp">: The max decimal number that each large integer can store (see
    <b>DC_BASE_DIGS</b>) plus <b>1</b>. Depends on <b>DC_BASE_DIGS</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>DC_OVERFLOW_MAX</b></p>
<p class="Pp">: The max number that the overflow type (see the

<p class="Pp"><b>DC_BASE_MAX</b></p>
<p class="Pp">: The maximum output base. Set at <b>DC_BASE_POW</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>DC_DIM_MAX</b></p>
<p class="Pp">: The maximum size of arrays. Set at <b>SIZE_MAX-1</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>DC_SCALE_MAX</b></p>
<p class="Pp">: The maximum <b>scale</b>. Set at <b>DC_OVERFLOW_MAX-1</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>DC_STRING_MAX</b></p>
<p class="Pp">: The maximum length of strings. Set at

<p class="Pp"><b>DC_RAND_MAX</b></p>
<p class="Pp">: The maximum integer (inclusive) returned by the <b>'</b>
    command, if dc(1). Set at <b>2^DC_LONG_BIT-1</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Exponent</p>
<p class="Pp">: The maximum allowable exponent (positive or negative). Set at

<p class="Pp">Number of vars</p>
<p class="Pp">: The maximum number of vars/arrays. Set at <b>SIZE_MAX-1</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">These limits are meant to be effectively non-existent; the limits
    are so large (at least on 64-bit machines) that there should not be any
    point at which they become a problem. In fact, memory should be exhausted

</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES"><a class="permalink" href="#ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES">ENVIRONMENT
  VARIABLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">dc(1) recognizes the following environment variables:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>DC_ENV_ARGS</b></p>
<p class="Pp">: This is another way to give command-line arguments to dc(1).
    They should be in the same format as all other command-line arguments. These
    are always processed first, so any files given in <b>DC_ENV_ARGS</b> will be
    processed before arguments and files given on the command-line. This gives
    the user the ability to set up &quot;standard&quot; options and files to be
    used at every invocation. The most useful thing for such files to contain
    would be useful functions that the user might want every time dc(1) runs.
    Another use would be to use the <b>-e</b> option to set <b>scale</b> to a
    value other than <b>0</b>.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
The code that parses **DC_ENV_ARGS** will correctly handle quoted arguments,
but it does not understand escape sequences. For example, the string
**&quot;/home/gavin/some dc file.dc&quot;** will be correctly parsed, but the string
**&quot;/home/gavin/some \&quot;dc\&quot; file.dc&quot;** will include the backslashes.
The quote parsing will handle either kind of quotes, **'** or **&quot;**. Thus,
if you have a file with any number of single quotes in the name, you can use
double quotes as the outside quotes, as in **&quot;some 'dc' file.dc&quot;**, and vice
versa if you have a file with double quotes. However, handling a file with
both kinds of quotes in **DC_ENV_ARGS** is not supported due to the
complexity of the parsing, though such files are still supported on the
command-line where the parsing is done by the shell.
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><b>DC_LINE_LENGTH</b></p>
<p class="Pp">: If this environment variable exists and contains an integer that
    is greater than <b>1</b> and is less than <b>UINT16_MAX</b> (<b>2^16-1</b>),
    dc(1) will output lines to that length, including the backslash newline
    combo. The default line length is <b>70</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>DC_EXPR_EXIT</b></p>
<p class="Pp">: If this variable exists (no matter the contents), dc(1) will
    exit immediately after executing expressions and files given by the
    <b>-e</b> and/or <b>-f</b> command-line options (and any equivalents).</p>

<p class="Pp"><b>0</b></p>
<p class="Pp">: No error.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>1</b></p>
<p class="Pp">: A math error occurred. This follows standard practice of using

    of normal execution.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>

Math errors include divide by **0**, taking the square root of a negative
number, using a negative number as a bound for the pseudo-random number
generator, attempting to convert a negative number to a hardware integer,
overflow when converting a number to a hardware integer, and attempting to
use a non-integer where an integer is required.
Converting to a hardware integer happens for the second operand of the power

operators.

Fatal errors include memory allocation errors, I/O errors, failing to open

only accepts ASCII characters), attempting to open a directory as a file,
and giving invalid command-line options.
    </pre>

</dl>
<p class="Pp">The exit status <b>4</b> is special; when a fatal error occurs,
    dc(1) always exits and returns <b>4</b>, no matter what mode dc(1) is
  in.</p>
<p class="Pp">The other statuses will only be returned when dc(1) is not in
    interactive mode (see the <b>INTERACTIVE MODE</b> section), since dc(1)
    resets its state (see the <b>RESET</b> section) and accepts more input when
    one of those errors occurs in interactive mode. This is also the case when
    interactive mode is forced by the <b>-i</b> flag or <b>--interactive</b>
    option.</p>
<p class="Pp">These exit statuses allow dc(1) to be used in shell scripting with
    error checking, and its normal behavior can be forced by using the <b>-i</b>
    flag or <b>--interactive</b> option.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INTERACTIVE_MODE"><a class="permalink" href="#INTERACTIVE_MODE">INTERACTIVE
  MODE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Like bc(1), dc(1) has an interactive mode and a non-interactive
    mode. Interactive mode is turned on automatically when both <b>stdin</b> and
    <b>stdout</b> are hooked to a terminal, but the <b>-i</b> flag and
    <b>--interactive</b> option can turn it on in other cases.</p>
<p class="Pp">In interactive mode, dc(1) attempts to recover from errors (see
    the <b>RESET</b> section), and in normal execution, flushes <b>stdout</b> as
    soon as execution is done for the current input.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TTY_MODE"><a class="permalink" href="#TTY_MODE">TTY
  MODE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If <b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout</b>, and <b>stderr</b> are all
    connected to a TTY, dc(1) turns on &quot;TTY mode.&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">TTY mode is required for history to be enabled (see the
    <b>COMMAND</b> <b>LINE HISTORY</b> section). It is also required to enable
    special handling for <b>SIGINT</b> signals.</p>
<p class="Pp">The prompt is enabled in TTY mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">TTY mode is different from interactive mode because interactive
    mode is required in the bc(1) specification
    (https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/bc.html), and
    interactive mode requires only <b>stdin</b> and <b>stdout</b> to be
    connected to a terminal.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SIGNAL_HANDLING"><a class="permalink" href="#SIGNAL_HANDLING">SIGNAL
  HANDLING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Sending a <b>SIGINT</b> will cause dc(1) to stop execution of the
    current input. If dc(1) is in TTY mode (see the <b>TTY MODE</b> section), it
    will reset (see the <b>RESET</b> section). Otherwise, it will clean up and
    exit.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that &quot;current input&quot; can mean one of two things. If
    dc(1) is processing input from <b>stdin</b> in TTY mode, it will ask for
    more input. If dc(1) is processing input from a file in TTY mode, it will
    stop processing the file and start processing the next file, if one exists,
    or ask for input from <b>stdin</b> if no other file exists.</p>
<p class="Pp">This means that if a <b>SIGINT</b> is sent to dc(1) as it is
    executing a file, it can seem as though dc(1) did not respond to the signal
    since it will immediately start executing the next file. This is by design;
    most files that users execute when interacting with dc(1) have function
    definitions, which are quick to parse. If a file takes a long time to
    execute, there may be a bug in that file. The rest of the files could still
    be executed without problem, allowing the user to continue.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>SIGTERM</b> and <b>SIGQUIT</b> cause dc(1) to clean up and
    exit, and it uses the default handler for all other signals. The one
    exception is <b>SIGHUP</b>; in that case, when dc(1) is in TTY mode, a
    <b>SIGHUP</b> will cause dc(1) to clean up and exit.</p>
