<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">mnthome</code> command unmounts the AFP
    (AppleShare) home directory that was automounted as guest, and remounts it
    with the correct privileges by logging into the AFP server using the current
    username and password. This command also allows you to have guest access
    turned off on your AFP server too and still have AFP home directories work
    with &quot;su&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you ssh into another computer using an account that has an
    AFP home directory or you &quot;su &lt;netuser&gt;&quot; where
    &lt;netuser&gt; is an AFP home directory user, then the resulting home
    directory will not have the correct access privileges.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is because automount is assuming NFS behavior which assumes
    that all computers share the same user/group privileges and mounts volumes
    using &quot;no security&quot; and lets the client enforce privileges based
    on the current user.</p>
<p class="Pp">AFP is different since the privileges are based on the user that
    logged into the server. Since automount does not put up an authentication
    dialog asking for an user name and password, automount mounts the fileserver
    using guest login. Thus you end up with getting the world access privileges
    and the privileges are shown via &quot;mapping&quot;. You also would have to
    allow guest access to the server to that sharepoint.</p>
<p class="Pp">Mapping makes all the files/folders appear like they are owned by
    the current user. Even those items not really owned by the current user show
    up as being owned by the current user. The server provides user access
    rights (UARights) which is a summary of what the access rights are
    regardless of the category (owner, group, world) from which they were
    obtained. When doing &quot;mapping&quot;, the AppleShare client will take
    these UARights and show them as the owner rights. So, everything looks like
    it is owned by the current user and the owner rights are set to the
    UARights. Thus if you had access to that file/folder before, then you still
    do.</p>

<p class="Pp">I get the mounting url from the &quot;home_loc&quot; attribute and
    the mountpath from the &quot;home&quot; attribute (with the path from
    home_loc subtracted out). If your AFP home directory automounts in a
    different location, then you need to use the -m option to specify an
    alternative mount point.</p>
<p class="Pp">I cant figure out how to cd out of the current home dir so I can
    do the unmount and then restore the user back into the new home dir. If you
    are in the AFP home directory when you use mnthome, you automatically get
    put back into that same directory when mnthome leaves. If mnthome works,
    then your current directory is a dead directory and you need to &quot;cd
    ~&quot; to get to your new home directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the server with the home directory was already mounted by
    another user, you will not be able to replace it with a mount made by your
    user id. The original mount must be first unmounted by the mounting user or
    root.</p>
