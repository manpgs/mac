<p class="Pp">These are general guidelines for how to write POD documentation
    for Perl scripts and modules, based on general guidelines for writing good
    UNIX man pages. All of these guidelines are, of course, optional, but
    following them will make your documentation more consistent with other
    documentation on the system.</p>
<p class="Pp">The name of the program being documented is conventionally written
    in bold (using B&lt;&gt;) wherever it occurs, as are all program options.
    Arguments should be written in italics (I&lt;&gt;). Function names are
    traditionally written in italics; if you write a function as
    <b>function()</b>, Pod::Man will take care of this for you. Literal code or
    commands should be in C&lt;&gt;. References to other man pages should be in
    the form <span class="Li">&quot;manpage(section)&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;L&lt;manpage(section)&gt;&quot;</span>, and Pod::Man
    will automatically format those appropriately. The second form, with
    L&lt;&gt;, is used to request that a POD formatter make a link to the man
    page if possible. As an exception, one normally omits the section when
    referring to module documentation since it's not clear what section module
    documentation will be in; use
    <span class="Li">&quot;L&lt;Module::Name&gt;&quot;</span> for module
    references instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">References to other programs or functions are normally in the form
    of man page references so that cross-referencing tools can provide the user
    with links and the like. It's possible to overdo this, though, so be careful
    not to clutter your documentation with too much markup. References to other
    programs that are not given as man page references should be enclosed in
    B&lt;&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The major headers should be set out using a
    <span class="Li">&quot;=head1&quot;</span> directive, and are historically
    written in the rather startling ALL UPPER CASE format; this is not
    mandatory, but it's strongly recommended so that sections have consistent
    naming across different software packages. Minor headers may be included
    using <span class="Li">&quot;=head2&quot;</span>, and are typically in mixed
    case.</p>
<p class="Pp">The standard sections of a manual page are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>NAME</dt>
  <dd>Mandatory section; should be a comma-separated list of programs or
      functions documented by this POD page, such as:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    foo, bar - programs to do something
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Manual page indexers are often extremely picky about the
        format of this section, so don't put anything in it except this line.
        Every program or function documented by this POD page should be listed,
        separated by a comma and a space. For a Perl module, just give the
        module name. A single dash, and only a single dash, should separate the
        list of programs or functions from the description. Do not use any
        markup such as C&lt;&gt; or B&lt;&gt; anywhere in this line. Functions
        should not be qualified with <span class="Li">&quot;()&quot;</span> or
        the like. The description should ideally fit on a single line, even if a
        man program replaces the dash with a few tabs.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="permalink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></dt>
  <dd>A short usage summary for programs and functions. This section is
      mandatory for section 3 pages. For Perl module documentation, it's usually
      convenient to have the contents of this section be a verbatim block
      showing some (brief) examples of typical ways the module is used.</dd>
  <dt>DESCRIPTION</dt>
  <dd>Extended description and discussion of the program or functions, or the
      body of the documentation for man pages that document something else. If
      particularly long, it's a good idea to break this up into subsections
      <span class="Li">&quot;=head2&quot;</span> directives like:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    =head2 Normal Usage
    =head2 Advanced Features
    =head2 Writing Configuration Files
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or whatever is appropriate for your documentation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For a module, this is generally where the documentation of the
        interfaces provided by the module goes, usually in the form of a list
        with an <span class="Li">&quot;=item&quot;</span> for each interface.
        Depending on how many interfaces there are, you may want to put that
        documentation in separate METHODS, FUNCTIONS, CLASS METHODS, or INSTANCE
        METHODS sections instead and save the DESCRIPTION section for an
        overview.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></dt>
  <dd>Detailed description of each of the command-line options taken by the
      program. This should be separate from the description for the use of
      parsers like Pod::Usage. This is normally presented as a list, with each
      option as a separate <span class="Li">&quot;=item&quot;</span>. The
      specific option string should be enclosed in B&lt;&gt;. Any values that
      the option takes should be enclosed in I&lt;&gt;. For example, the section
      for the option <b>--section</b>=<i>manext</i> would be introduced with:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    =item B&lt;--section&gt;=I&lt;manext&gt;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Synonymous options (like both the short and long forms) are
        separated by a comma and a space on the same
        <span class="Li">&quot;=item&quot;</span> line, or optionally listed as
        their own item with a reference to the canonical name. For example,
        since <b>--section</b> can also be written as <b>-s</b>, the above would
        be:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    =item B&lt;-s&gt; I&lt;manext&gt;, B&lt;--section&gt;=I&lt;manext&gt;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Writing the short option first is recommended because it's
        easier to read. The long option is long enough to draw the eye to it
        anyway and the short option can otherwise get lost in visual noise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="RETURN"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN">RETURN VALUE</a></dt>
  <dd>What the program or function returns, if successful. This section can be
      omitted for programs whose precise exit codes aren't important, provided
      they return 0 on success and non-zero on failure as is standard. It should
      always be present for functions. For modules, it may be useful to
      summarize return values from the module interface here, or it may be more
      useful to discuss return values separately in the documentation of each
      function or method the module provides.</dd>
  <dt id="ERRORS"><a class="permalink" href="#ERRORS">ERRORS</a></dt>
  <dd>Exceptions, error return codes, exit statuses, and errno settings.
      Typically used for function or module documentation; program documentation
      uses DIAGNOSTICS instead. The general rule of thumb is that errors printed
      to <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;STDERR&quot;</span> and intended for the end user
      are documented in DIAGNOSTICS while errors passed internal to the calling
      program and intended for other programmers are documented in ERRORS. When
      documenting a function that sets errno, a full list of the possible errno
      values should be given here.</dd>
  <dt id="DIAGNOSTICS"><a class="permalink" href="#DIAGNOSTICS">DIAGNOSTICS</a></dt>
  <dd>All possible messages the program can print out and what they mean. You
      may wish to follow the same documentation style as the Perl documentation;
      see <b>perldiag</b>(1) for more details (and look at the POD source as
      well).
    <p class="Pp">If applicable, please include details on what the user should
        do to correct the error; documenting an error as indicating &quot;the
        input buffer is too small&quot; without telling the user how to increase
        the size of the input buffer (or at least telling them that it isn't
        possible) aren't very useful.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></dt>
  <dd>Give some example uses of the program or function. Don't skimp; users
      often find this the most useful part of the documentation. The examples
      are generally given as verbatim paragraphs.
    <p class="Pp">Don't just present an example without explaining what it does.
        Adding a short paragraph saying what the example will do can increase
        the value of the example immensely.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></dt>
  <dd>Environment variables that the program cares about, normally presented as
      a list using <span class="Li">&quot;=over&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;=item&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;=back&quot;</span>. For example:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    =over 6
    =item HOME
    Used to determine the user's home directory.  F&lt;.foorc&gt; in this
    directory is read for configuration details, if it exists.
    =back
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Since environment variables are normally in all uppercase, no
        additional special formatting is generally needed; they're glaring
        enough as it is.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="FILES"><a class="permalink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></dt>
  <dd>All files used by the program or function, normally presented as a list,
      and what it uses them for. File names should be enclosed in F&lt;&gt;.
      It's particularly important to document files that will be potentially
      modified.</dd>
  <dt id="CAVEATS"><a class="permalink" href="#CAVEATS">CAVEATS</a></dt>
  <dd>Things to take special care with, sometimes called WARNINGS.</dd>
  <dt id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></dt>
  <dd>Things that are broken or just don't work quite right.</dd>
  <dt id="RESTRICTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#RESTRICTIONS">RESTRICTIONS</a></dt>
  <dd>Bugs you don't plan to fix. :-)</dd>
  <dt id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></dt>
  <dd>Miscellaneous commentary.</dd>
  <dt>AUTHOR</dt>
  <dd>Who wrote it (use AUTHORS for multiple people). It's a good idea to
      include your current e-mail address (or some e-mail address to which bug
      reports should be sent) or some other contact information so that users
      have a way of contacting you. Remember that program documentation tends to
      roam the wild for far longer than you expect and pick a contact method
      that's likely to last.</dd>
  <dt id="HISTORY"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></dt>
  <dd>Programs derived from other sources sometimes have this. Some people keep
      a modification log here, but that usually gets long and is normally better
      maintained in a separate file.</dd>
  <dt id="COPYRIGHT"><a class="permalink" href="#COPYRIGHT">COPYRIGHT AND
    LICENSE</a></dt>
  <dd>For copyright
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    Copyright YEAR(s) YOUR NAME(s)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(No, (C) is not needed. No, &quot;all rights reserved&quot; is
        not needed.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">For licensing the easiest way is to use the same licensing as
        Perl itself:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    This library is free software; you may redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the same terms as Perl itself.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This makes it easy for people to use your module with Perl.
        Note that this licensing example is neither an endorsement or a
        requirement, you are of course free to choose any licensing.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="SEE"><a class="permalink" href="#SEE">SEE ALSO</a></dt>
  <dd>Other man pages to check out, like <b>man</b>(1), <b>man</b>(7),
      <b>makewhatis</b>(8), or <b>catman</b>(8). Normally a simple list of man
      pages separated by commas, or a paragraph giving the name of a reference
      work. Man page references, if they use the standard
      <span class="Li">&quot;name(section)&quot;</span> form, don't have to be
      enclosed in L&lt;&gt; (although it's recommended), but other things in
      this section probably should be when appropriate.
    <p class="Pp">If the package has a mailing list, include a URL or
        subscription instructions here.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the package has a web site, include a URL here.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Documentation of object-oriented libraries or modules may want to
    use CONSTRUCTORS and METHODS sections, or CLASS METHODS and INSTANCE METHODS
    sections, for detailed documentation of the parts of the library and save
    the DESCRIPTION section for an overview. Large modules with a function
    interface may want to use FUNCTIONS for similar reasons. Some people use
    OVERVIEW to summarize the description if it's quite long.</p>
<p class="Pp">Section ordering varies, although NAME must always be the first
    section (you'll break some man page systems otherwise), and NAME, SYNOPSIS,
    DESCRIPTION, and OPTIONS generally always occur first and in that order if
    present. In general, SEE ALSO, AUTHOR, and similar material should be left
    for last. Some systems also move WARNINGS and NOTES to last. The order given
    above should be reasonable for most purposes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some systems use CONFORMING TO to note conformance to relevant
    standards and MT-LEVEL to note safeness for use in threaded programs or
    signal handlers. These headings are primarily useful when documenting parts
    of a C library.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, as a general note, try not to use an excessive amount of
    markup. As documented here and in Pod::Man, you can safely leave Perl
    variables, function names, man page references, and the like unadorned by
    markup and the POD translators will figure it out for you. This makes it
    much easier to later edit the documentation. Note that many existing
    translators will do the wrong thing with e-mail addresses when wrapped in
    L&lt;&gt;, so don't do that.</p>
