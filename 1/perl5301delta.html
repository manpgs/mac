  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;ECHO&quot;</span> macro is now defined. This is
      used in a <span class="Li">&quot;dtrace&quot;</span> rule that was
      originally changed for FreeBSD, and the FreeBSD make apparently predefines
      it. The Solaris make does not predefine
      <span class="Li">&quot;ECHO&quot;</span> which broke this rule on Solaris.

  <dd>The locale tests could crash on Win32 due to a Windows bug, and separately

  <li>Setting <span class="Li">$)</span> now properly sets supplementary group
      ids, if you have the necessary privileges. [perl #17031]
      &lt;https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/17031&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;readline @foo&quot;</span> now evaluates
      <span class="Li">@foo</span> in scalar context. Previously, it would be
      evaluated in list context, and since <b>readline()</b> pops only one
      argument from the stack, the stack could underflow, or be left with
      unexpected values on it. [perl #16929]
      &lt;https://github.com/perl/perl5/issues/16929&gt;</li>
  <li><b>sv_gets()</b> now recovers better if the target SV is modified by a
      signal handler. [perl #16960]

  <li>Matching a non-<span class="Li">&quot;SVf_UTF8&quot;</span> string against
      a regular expression containing Unicode literals could leak an SV on each
      match attempt. [perl #17140]

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;sprintf(&quot;%.*a&quot;, -10000, $x)&quot;</span>

<p class="Pp">Perl 5.30.1 represents approximately 6 months of development since
    Perl 5.30.0 and contains approximately 4,700 lines of changes across 67
    files from 14 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 910 lines of changes to 20 .pm, .t, .c and .h
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.30.1:</p>
<p class="Pp">Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dan Book, David Mitchell, Hugo van der
    Sanden, James E Keenan, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Manuel Mausz, Max
    Maischein, Nicolas R., Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Tom Hukins, Tony Cook.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,

<p class="Pp">If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug
    database at &lt;https://rt.perl.org/&gt;. There may also be information at
    &lt;http://www.perl.org/&gt;, the Perl Home Page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
    &quot;SECURITY VULNERABILITY CONTACT INFORMATION&quot; in perlsec for
