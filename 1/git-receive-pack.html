<p class="Pp">Invoked by <i>git send-pack</i> and updates the repository with
    the information fed from the remote end.</p>
<p class="Pp">This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user. The
    UI for the protocol is on the <i>git send-pack</i> side, and the program
    pair is meant to be used to push updates to remote repository. For pull
    operations, see <b>git-fetch-pack</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">The command allows for creation and fast-forwarding of sha1 refs
    (heads/tags) on the remote end (strictly speaking, it is the local end
    <i>git-receive-pack</i> runs, but to the user who is sitting at the
    send-pack end, it is updating the remote. Confused?)</p>
<p class="Pp">There are other real-world examples of using update and
    post-update hooks found in the Documentation/howto directory.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>git-receive-pack</i> honours the receive.denyNonFastForwards
    config option, which tells it if updates to a ref should be denied if they
    are not fast-forwards.</p>
<p class="Pp">A number of other receive.* config options are available to tweak
    its behavior, see <b>git-config</b>(1).</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PRE"><a class="permalink" href="#PRE">PRE-RECEIVE
  HOOK</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Before any ref is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-receive file
    exists and is executable, it will be invoked once with no parameters. The
    standard input of the hook will be one line per ref to be updated:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>sha1-old SP sha1-new SP refname LF</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The refname value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master
    head this is &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two sha1 values before each
    refname are the object names for the refname before and after the update.
    Refs to be created will have sha1-old equal to 0{40}, while refs to be
    deleted will have sha1-new equal to 0{40}, otherwise sha1-old and sha1-new
    should be valid objects in the repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">When accepting a signed push (see <b>git-push</b>(1)), the signed
    push certificate is stored in a blob and an environment variable
    <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT</b> can be consulted for its object name. See the
    description of <b>post-receive</b> hook for an example. In addition, the
    certificate is verified using GPG and the result is exported with the
    following environment variables:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_SIGNER</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The name and the e-mail address of the owner of the key
  that signed the push certificate.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_KEY</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The GPG key ID of the key that signed the push
  certificate.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_STATUS</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The status of GPG verification of the push certificate,
  using the same mnemonic as used in <b>%G?</b> format of <b>git log</b> family
  of commands (see <b>git-log</b>(1)).</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The nonce string the process asked the signer to include
  in the push certificate. If this does not match the value recorded on the
  &quot;nonce&quot; header in the push certificate, it may indicate that the
  certificate is a valid one that is being replayed from a separate &quot;git
  push&quot; session.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_STATUS</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"><b>UNSOLICITED</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&quot;git push --signed&quot; sent a nonce when we did
  not ask it to send one.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>MISSING</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&quot;git push --signed&quot; did not send any nonce
  header.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>BAD</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&quot;git push --signed&quot; sent a bogus nonce.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>OK</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&quot;git push --signed&quot; sent the nonce we asked it
  to send.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>SLOP</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&quot;git push --signed&quot; sent a nonce different from
  what we asked it to send now, but in a previous session. See
  <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_SLOP</b> environment variable.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_SLOP</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&quot;git push --signed&quot; sent a nonce different from
  what we asked it to send now, but in a different session whose starting time
  is different by this many seconds from the current session. Only meaningful
  when <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_STATUS</b> says <b>SLOP</b>. Also read about
  <b>receive.certNonceSlop</b> variable in <b>git-config</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">This hook is called before any refname is updated and before any
    fast-forward checks are performed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the pre-receive hook exits with a non-zero exit status no
    updates will be performed, and the update, post-receive and post-update
    hooks will not be invoked either. This can be useful to quickly bail out if
    the update is not to be supported.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the notes on the quarantine environment below.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="UPDATE_HOOK"><a class="permalink" href="#UPDATE_HOOK">UPDATE
  HOOK</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Before each ref is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/update file exists
    and is executable, it is invoked once per ref, with three parameters:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$GIT_DIR/hooks/update refname sha1-old sha1-new</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The refname parameter is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master
    head this is &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two sha1 arguments are the
    object names for the refname before and after the update. Note that the hook
    is called before the refname is updated, so either sha1-old is 0{40}
    (meaning there is no such ref yet), or it should match what is recorded in
    refname.</p>
<p class="Pp">The hook should exit with non-zero status if it wants to disallow
    updating the named ref. Otherwise it should exit with zero.</p>
<p class="Pp">Successful execution (a zero exit status) of this hook does not
    ensure the ref will actually be updated, it is only a prerequisite. As such
    it is not a good idea to send notices (e.g. email) from this hook. Consider
    using the post-receive hook instead.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh">POST-RECEIVE HOOK</h1>
<p class="Pp">After all refs were updated (or attempted to be updated), if any
    ref update was successful, and if $GIT_DIR/hooks/post-receive file exists
    and is executable, it will be invoked once with no parameters. The standard
    input of the hook will be one line for each successfully updated ref:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>sha1-old SP sha1-new SP refname LF</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The refname value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master
    head this is &quot;refs/heads/master&quot;. The two sha1 values before each
    refname are the object names for the refname before and after the update.
    Refs that were created will have sha1-old equal to 0{40}, while refs that
    were deleted will have sha1-new equal to 0{40}, otherwise sha1-old and
    sha1-new should be valid objects in the repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT*</b> environment variables can be inspected,
    just as in <b>pre-receive</b> hook, after accepting a signed push.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using this hook, it is easy to generate mails describing the
    updates to the repository. This example script sends one mail message per
    ref listing the commits pushed to the repository, and logs the push
    certificates of signed pushes with good signatures to a logger service:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>#!/bin/sh
# mail out commit update information.
while read oval nval ref
do
        if expr &quot;$oval&quot; : '0*$' &gt;/dev/null
        then
                echo &quot;Created a new ref, with the following commits:&quot;
                git rev-list --pretty &quot;$nval&quot;
        else
                echo &quot;New commits:&quot;
                git rev-list --pretty &quot;$nval&quot; &quot;^$oval&quot;
        fi |
        mail -s &quot;Changes to ref $ref&quot; commit-list@mydomain
done
# log signed push certificate, if any
if test -n &quot;${GIT_PUSH_CERT-}&quot; &amp;&amp; test ${GIT_PUSH_CERT_STATUS} = G
then
        (
                echo expected nonce is ${GIT_PUSH_NONCE}
                git cat-file blob ${GIT_PUSH_CERT}
        ) | mail -s &quot;push certificate from $GIT_PUSH_CERT_SIGNER&quot; push-log@mydomain
fi
exit 0</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The exit code from this hook invocation is ignored, however a
    non-zero exit code will generate an error message.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that it is possible for refname to not have sha1-new when
    this hook runs. This can easily occur if another user modifies the ref after
    it was updated by <i>git-receive-pack</i>, but before the hook was able to
    evaluate it. It is recommended that hooks rely on sha1-new rather than the
    current value of refname.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh">POST-UPDATE HOOK</h1>
<p class="Pp">After all other processing, if at least one ref was updated, and
    if $GIT_DIR/hooks/post-update file exists and is executable, then
    post-update will be called with the list of refs that have been updated.
    This can be used to implement any repository wide cleanup tasks.</p>
<p class="Pp">The exit code from this hook invocation is ignored; the only thing
    left for <i>git-receive-pack</i> to do at that point is to exit itself
    anyway.</p>
<p class="Pp">This hook can be used, for example, to run <b>git
    update-server-info</b> if the repository is packed and is served via a dumb
    transport.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>#!/bin/sh
exec git update-server-info</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="QUARANTINE_ENVIRONMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#QUARANTINE_ENVIRONMENT">QUARANTINE
  ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When <b>receive-pack</b> takes in objects, they are placed into a
    temporary &quot;quarantine&quot; directory within the
    <b>$GIT_DIR/objects</b> directory and migrated into the main object store
    only after the <b>pre-receive</b> hook has completed. If the push fails
    before then, the temporary directory is removed entirely.</p>
<p class="Pp">This has a few user-visible effects and caveats:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.Pushes which fail due to problems with the incoming
  pack, missing objects, or due to the <b>pre-receive</b> hook will not leave
  any on-disk data. This is usually helpful to prevent repeated failed pushes
  from filling up your disk, but can make debugging more challenging.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Any objects created by the <b>pre-receive</b> hook
  will be created in the quarantine directory (and migrated only if it
  succeeds).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.The <b>pre-receive</b> hook MUST NOT update any refs
  to point to quarantined objects. Other programs accessing the repository will
  not be able to see the objects (and if the pre-receive hook fails, those refs
  would become corrupted). For safety, any ref updates from within
  <b>pre-receive</b> are automatically rejected.</div>
