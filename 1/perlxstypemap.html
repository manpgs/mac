<p class="Pp">The more you think about interfacing between two languages, the
    more you'll realize that the majority of programmer effort has to go into
    converting between the data structures that are native to either of the
    languages involved. This trumps other matter such as differing calling
    conventions because the problem space is so much greater. There are simply
    more ways to shove data into memory than there are ways to implement a
    function call.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl XS' attempt at a solution to this is the concept of typemaps.
    At an abstract level, a Perl XS typemap is nothing but a recipe for
    converting from a certain Perl data structure to a certain C data structure
    and vice versa. Since there can be C types that are sufficiently similar to
    one another to warrant converting with the same logic, XS typemaps are
    represented by a unique identifier, henceforth called an <b>XS type</b> in
    this document. You can then tell the XS compiler that multiple C types are
    to be mapped with the same XS typemap.</p>
<p class="Pp">In your XS code, when you define an argument with a C type or when
    you are using a <span class="Li">&quot;CODE:&quot;</span> and an
    <span class="Li">&quot;OUTPUT:&quot;</span> section together with a C return
    type of your XSUB, it'll be the typemapping mechanism that makes this
  easy.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Anatomy_of_a_typemap"><a class="permalink" href="#Anatomy_of_a_typemap">Anatomy
  of a typemap</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In more practical terms, the typemap is a collection of code
    fragments which are used by the <b>xsubpp</b> compiler to map C function
    parameters and values to Perl values. The typemap file may consist of three
    sections labelled <span class="Li">&quot;TYPEMAP&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;INPUT&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</span>. An unlabelled initial section is
    assumed to be a <span class="Li">&quot;TYPEMAP&quot;</span> section. The
    INPUT section tells the compiler how to translate Perl values into variables
    of certain C types. The OUTPUT section tells the compiler how to translate
    the values from certain C types into values Perl can understand. The TYPEMAP
    section tells the compiler which of the INPUT and OUTPUT code fragments
    should be used to map a given C type to a Perl value. The section labels
    <span class="Li">&quot;TYPEMAP&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;INPUT&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</span> must begin in the first column on
    a line by themselves, and must be in uppercase.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each type of section can appear an arbitrary number of times and
    does not have to appear at all. For example, a typemap may commonly lack
    <span class="Li">&quot;INPUT&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</span> sections if all it needs to do is
    associate additional C types with core XS types like T_PTROBJ. Lines that
    start with a hash <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> are considered
    comments and ignored in the <span class="Li">&quot;TYPEMAP&quot;</span>
    section, but are considered significant in
    <span class="Li">&quot;INPUT&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</span>. Blank lines are generally
    ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">Traditionally, typemaps needed to be written to a separate file,
    conventionally called <span class="Li">&quot;typemap&quot;</span> in a CPAN
    distribution. With ExtUtils::ParseXS (the XS compiler) version 3.12 or
    better which comes with perl 5.16, typemaps can also be embedded directly
    into XS code using a HERE-doc like syntax:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  TYPEMAP: &lt;&lt;HERE
  ...
  HERE
</pre>
<p class="Pp">where <span class="Li">&quot;HERE&quot;</span> can be replaced by
    other identifiers like with normal Perl HERE-docs. All details below about
    the typemap textual format remain valid.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;TYPEMAP&quot;</span> section should
    contain one pair of C type and XS type per line as follows. An example from
    the core typemap file:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  TYPEMAP
  # all variants of char* is handled by the T_PV typemap
  char *          T_PV
  const char *    T_PV
  unsigned char * T_PV
  ...
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;INPUT&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</span> sections have identical formats,
    that is, each unindented line starts a new in- or output map respectively. A
    new in- or output map must start with the name of the XS type to map on a
    line by itself, followed by the code that implements it indented on the
    following lines. Example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  INPUT
  T_PV
    $var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg)
  T_PTR
    $var = INT2PTR($type,SvIV($arg))
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We'll get to the meaning of those Perlish-looking variables in a
    little bit.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, here's an example of the full typemap file for mapping C
    strings of the <span class="Li">&quot;char *&quot;</span> type to Perl
    scalars/strings:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  TYPEMAP
  char *  T_PV

  INPUT
  T_PV
    $var = ($type)SvPV_nolen($arg)

  OUTPUT
  T_PV
    sv_setpv((SV*)$arg, $var);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here's a more complicated example: suppose that you wanted
    <span class="Li">&quot;struct netconfig&quot;</span> to be blessed into the
    class <span class="Li">&quot;Net::Config&quot;</span>. One way to do this is
    to use underscores (_) to separate package names, as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  typedef struct netconfig * Net_Config;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And then provide a typemap entry
    <span class="Li">&quot;T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL&quot;</span> that maps underscores
    to double-colons (::), and declare
    <span class="Li">&quot;Net_Config&quot;</span> to be of that type:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  TYPEMAP
  Net_Config      T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL

  INPUT
  T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
    if (sv_derived_from($arg, \&quot;${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\&quot;)){
      IV tmp = SvIV((SV*)SvRV($arg));
      $var = INT2PTR($type, tmp);
    }
    else
      croak(\&quot;$var is not of type ${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\&quot;)

  OUTPUT
  T_PTROBJ_SPECIAL
    sv_setref_pv($arg, \&quot;${(my $ntt=$ntype)=~s/_/::/g;\$ntt}\&quot;,
                 (void*)$var);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The INPUT and OUTPUT sections substitute underscores for
    double-colons on the fly, giving the desired effect. This example
    demonstrates some of the power and versatility of the typemap facility.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;INT2PTR&quot;</span> macro (defined in
    perl.h) casts an integer to a pointer of a given type, taking care of the
    possible different size of integers and pointers. There are also
    <span class="Li">&quot;PTR2IV&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;PTR2UV&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;PTR2NV&quot;</span> macros, to map the other way,
    which may be useful in OUTPUT sections.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Role_of_the_typemap_File_in_Your_Distribution"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Role_of_the_typemap_File_in_Your_Distribution">The
  Role of the typemap File in Your Distribution</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The default typemap in the <i>lib/ExtUtils</i> directory of the
    Perl source contains many useful types which can be used by Perl extensions.
    Some extensions define additional typemaps which they keep in their own
    directory. These additional typemaps may reference INPUT and OUTPUT maps in
    the main typemap. The <b>xsubpp</b> compiler will allow the extension's own
    typemap to override any mappings which are in the default typemap. Instead
    of using an additional <i>typemap</i> file, typemaps may be embedded
    verbatim in XS with a heredoc-like syntax. See the documentation on the
    <span class="Li">&quot;TYPEMAP:&quot;</span> XS keyword.</p>
<p class="Pp">For CPAN distributions, you can assume that the XS types defined
    by the perl core are already available. Additionally, the core typemap has
    default XS types for a large number of C types. For example, if you simply
    return a <span class="Li">&quot;char *&quot;</span> from your XSUB, the core
    typemap will have this C type associated with the T_PV XS type. That means
    your C string will be copied into the PV (pointer value) slot of a new
    scalar that will be returned from your XSUB to Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you're developing a CPAN distribution using XS, you may add
    your own file called <i>typemap</i> to the distribution. That file may
    contain typemaps that either map types that are specific to your code or
    that override the core typemap file's mappings for common C types.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Sharing_typemaps_Between_"><a class="permalink" href="#Sharing_typemaps_Between_">Sharing
  typemaps Between CPAN Distributions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Starting with ExtUtils::ParseXS version 3.13_01 (comes with perl
    5.16 and better), it is rather easy to share typemap code between multiple
    CPAN distributions. The general idea is to share it as a module that offers
    a certain API and have the dependent modules declare that as a built-time
    requirement and import the typemap into the XS. An example of such a
    typemap-sharing module on CPAN is
    <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic&quot;</span>. Two steps to
    getting that module's typemaps available in your code:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Declare <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::Typemaps::Basic&quot;</span> as a
      build-time dependency in <span class="Li">&quot;Makefile.PL&quot;</span>
      (use <span class="Li">&quot;BUILD_REQUIRES&quot;</span>), or in your
      <span class="Li">&quot;Build.PL&quot;</span> (use
      <span class="Li">&quot;build_requires&quot;</span>).</li>
  <li>Include the following line in the XS section of your XS file: (don't break
      the line)
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  INCLUDE_COMMAND: $^X -MExtUtils::Typemaps::Cmd
                   -e &quot;print embeddable_typemap(q{Basic})&quot;
    </pre>
  </li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Writing_typemap_Entries"><a class="permalink" href="#Writing_typemap_Entries">Writing
  typemap Entries</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Each INPUT or OUTPUT typemap entry is a double-quoted Perl string
    that will be evaluated in the presence of certain variables to get the final
    C code for mapping a certain C type.</p>
<p class="Pp">This means that you can embed Perl code in your typemap (C) code
    using constructs such as <span class="Li">&quot;${ perl code that evaluates
    to scalar reference here }&quot;</span>. A common use case is to generate
    error messages that refer to the true function name even when using the
    ALIAS XS feature:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  ${ $ALIAS ? \q[GvNAME(CvGV(cv))] : \qq[\&quot;$pname\&quot;] }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For many typemap examples, refer to the core typemap file that can
    be found in the perl source tree at <i>lib/ExtUtils/typemap</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Perl variables that are available for interpolation into
    typemaps are the following:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><i></i><i>$var</i><i></i> - the name of the input or output variable, eg.
      RETVAL for return values.</li>
  <li><i></i><i>$type</i><i></i> - the raw C type of the parameter, any
      <span class="Li">&quot;:&quot;</span> replaced with
      <span class="Li">&quot;_&quot;</span>. e.g. for a type of
      <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::Bar&quot;</span>, <i></i><i>$type</i><i></i>
      is <span class="Li">&quot;Foo__Bar&quot;</span></li>
  <li><i></i><i>$ntype</i><i></i> - the supplied type with
      <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> replaced with
      <span class="Li">&quot;Ptr&quot;</span>. e.g. for a type of
      <span class="Li">&quot;Foo*&quot;</span>, <i></i><i>$ntype</i><i></i> is
      <span class="Li">&quot;FooPtr&quot;</span></li>
  <li><i></i><i>$arg</i><i></i> - the stack entry, that the parameter is input
      from or output to, e.g. <span class="Li">ST(0)</span></li>
  <li><i></i><i>$argoff</i><i></i> - the argument stack offset of the argument.
      ie. 0 for the first argument, etc.</li>
  <li><i></i><i>$pname</i><i></i> - the full name of the XSUB, with including
      the <span class="Li">&quot;PACKAGE&quot;</span> name, with any
      <span class="Li">&quot;PREFIX&quot;</span> stripped. This is the non-ALIAS
      name.</li>
  <li><i></i><i>$Package</i><i></i> - the package specified by the most recent
      <span class="Li">&quot;PACKAGE&quot;</span> keyword.</li>
  <li><i></i><i>$ALIAS</i><i></i> - non-zero if the current XSUB has any aliases
      declared with <span class="Li">&quot;ALIAS&quot;</span>.</li>

  <dd>Similar to T_PTRREF except that the reference is blessed into a class.
      This allows the pointer to be used as an object. Most commonly used to
      deal with C structs. The typemap checks that the perl object passed into
      the XS routine is of the correct class (or part of a subclass).
    <p class="Pp">The pointer is blessed into a class that is derived from the
        name of type of the pointer but with all '*' in the name replaced with
        'Ptr'.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For <span class="Li">&quot;DESTROY&quot;</span> XSUBs only, a
        T_PTROBJ is optimized to a T_PTRREF. This means the class check is

  <dd>Similar to T_PTROBJ in that the pointer is blessed into a scalar object.
      The difference is that when the object is passed back into XS it must be
      of the correct type (inheritance is not supported) while T_PTROBJ supports
      inheritance.

  <dd>Similar to T_PTRREF, except the pointer stored in the referenced scalar is

      is to T_PTRREF as T_OPAQUE is to T_OPAQUEPTR. All clear?

  <dt id="T_OPAQUEPTR"><a class="permalink" href="#T_OPAQUEPTR">T_OPAQUEPTR</a></dt>
  <dd>This can be used to store bytes in the string component of the SV. Here
      the representation of the data is irrelevant to perl and the bytes
      themselves are just stored in the SV. It is assumed that the C variable is
      a pointer (the bytes are copied from that memory location). If the pointer
      is pointing to something that is represented by 8 bytes then those 8 bytes
      are stored in the SV (and <b>length()</b> will report a value of 8). This
      entry is similar to T_OPAQUE.
    <p class="Pp">In principle the <b>unpack()</b> command can be used to
        convert the bytes back to a number (if the underlying type is known to
        be a number).</p>
    <p class="Pp">This entry can be used to store a C structure (the number of
        bytes to be copied is calculated using the C
        <span class="Li">&quot;sizeof&quot;</span> function) and can be used as
        an alternative to T_PTRREF without having to worry about a memory leak
        (since Perl will clean up the SV).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="T_OPAQUE"><a class="permalink" href="#T_OPAQUE">T_OPAQUE</a></dt>
  <dd>This can be used to store data from non-pointer types in the string part
      of an SV. It is similar to T_OPAQUEPTR except that the typemap retrieves
      the pointer directly rather than assuming it is being supplied. For
      example, if an integer is imported into Perl using T_OPAQUE rather than
      T_IV the underlying bytes representing the integer will be stored in the
      SV but the actual integer value will not be available. i.e. The data is
      opaque to perl.
    <p class="Pp">The data may be retrieved using the
        <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span> function if the underlying
        type of the byte stream is known.</p>
    <p class="Pp">T_OPAQUE supports input and output of simple types.
        T_OPAQUEPTR can be used to pass these bytes back into C if a pointer is
        acceptable.</p>

  <dd>xsubpp supports a special syntax for returning packed C arrays to perl. If
      the XS return type is given as
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  array(type, nelem)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">xsubpp will copy the contents of <span class="Li">&quot;nelem
        * sizeof(type)&quot;</span> bytes from RETVAL to an SV and push it onto
        the stack. This is only really useful if the number of items to be
        returned is known at compile time and you don't mind having a string of
        bytes in your SV. Use T_ARRAY to push a variable number of arguments
        onto the return stack (they won't be packed as a single string
      though).</p>
    <p class="Pp">This is similar to using T_OPAQUEPTR but can be used to
        process more than one element.</p>

  <dd>Calls user-supplied functions for conversion. For
      <span class="Li">&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</span> (XSUB to Perl), a function
      named <span class="Li">&quot;XS_pack_$ntype&quot;</span> is called with
      the output Perl scalar and the C variable to convert from.
      <span class="Li">$ntype</span> is the normalized C type that is to be
      mapped to Perl. Normalized means that all
      <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> are replaced by the string
      <span class="Li">&quot;Ptr&quot;</span>. The return value of the function
      is ignored.
    <p class="Pp">Conversely for <span class="Li">&quot;INPUT&quot;</span> (Perl
        to XSUB) mapping, the function named
        <span class="Li">&quot;XS_unpack_$ntype&quot;</span> is called with the
        input Perl scalar as argument and the return value is cast to the mapped
        C type and assigned to the output C variable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An example conversion function for a typemapped struct
        <span class="Li">&quot;foo_t *&quot;</span> might be:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  static void
  XS_pack_foo_tPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in)
  {
    dTHX; /* alas, signature does not include pTHX_ */
    HV* hash = newHV();
    hv_stores(hash, &quot;int_member&quot;, newSViv(in-&gt;int_member));
    hv_stores(hash, &quot;float_member&quot;, newSVnv(in-&gt;float_member));
    /* ... */

    /* mortalize as thy stack is not refcounted */
    sv_setsv(out, sv_2mortal(newRV_noinc((SV*)hash)));
  }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The conversion from Perl to C is left as an exercise to the
        reader, but the prototype would be:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  static foo_t *
  XS_unpack_foo_tPtr(SV *in);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Instead of an actual C function that has to fetch the thread
        context using <span class="Li">&quot;dTHX&quot;</span>, you can define
        macros of the same name and avoid the overhead. Also, keep in mind to
        possibly free the memory allocated by
        <span class="Li">&quot;XS_unpack_foo_tPtr&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="T_PACKEDARRAY"><a class="permalink" href="#T_PACKEDARRAY">T_PACKEDARRAY</a></dt>
  <dd>T_PACKEDARRAY is similar to T_PACKED. In fact, the
      <span class="Li">&quot;INPUT&quot;</span> (Perl to XSUB) typemap is
      identical, but the <span class="Li">&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</span> typemap
      passes an additional argument to the
      <span class="Li">&quot;XS_pack_$ntype&quot;</span> function. This third
      parameter indicates the number of elements in the output so that the
      function can handle C arrays sanely. The variable needs to be declared by
      the user and must have the name
      <span class="Li">&quot;count_$ntype&quot;</span> where
      <span class="Li">$ntype</span> is the normalized C type name as explained
      above. The signature of the function would be for the example above and
      <span class="Li">&quot;foo_t **&quot;</span>:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  static void
  XS_pack_foo_tPtrPtr(SV *out, foo_t *in, UV count_foo_tPtrPtr);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The type of the third parameter is arbitrary as far as the
        typemap is concerned. It just has to be in line with the declared
        variable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Of course, unless you know the number of elements in the
        <span class="Li">&quot;sometype **&quot;</span> C array, within your
        XSUB, the return value from <span class="Li">&quot;foo_t **
        XS_unpack_foo_tPtrPtr(...)&quot;</span> will be hard to decipher. Since
        the details are all up to the XS author (the typemap user), there are
        several solutions, none of which particularly elegant. The most commonly
        seen solution has been to allocate memory for N+1 pointers and assign
        <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span> to the (N+1)th to facilitate
        iteration.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Alternatively, using a customized typemap for your purposes in
        the first place is probably preferable.</p>

  <dd>This is used to convert the perl argument list to a C array and for
      pushing the contents of a C array onto the perl argument stack.
    <p class="Pp">The usual calling signature is</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  @out = array_func( @in );
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Any number of arguments can occur in the list before the array
        but the input and output arrays must be the last elements in the
      list.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When used to pass a perl list to C the XS writer must provide
        a function (named after the array type but with 'Ptr' substituted for
        '*') to allocate the memory required to hold the list. A pointer should
        be returned. It is up to the XS writer to free the memory on exit from
        the function. The variable <span class="Li">&quot;ix_$var&quot;</span>
        is set to the number of elements in the new array.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When returning a C array to Perl the XS writer must provide an
        integer variable called <span class="Li">&quot;size_$var&quot;</span>
        containing the number of elements in the array. This is used to
        determine how many elements should be pushed onto the return argument
        stack. This is not required on input since Perl knows how many arguments
        are on the stack when the routine is called. Ordinarily this variable
        would be called <span class="Li">&quot;size_RETVAL&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Additionally, the type of each element is determined from the
        type of the array. If the array uses type
        <span class="Li">&quot;intArray *&quot;</span> xsubpp will automatically
        work out that it contains variables of type
        <span class="Li">&quot;int&quot;</span> and use that typemap entry to
        perform the copy of each element. All pointer '*' and 'Array' tags are
        removed from the name to determine the subtype.</p>
