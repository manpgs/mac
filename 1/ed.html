<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">ed</code> utility is a line-oriented text
    editor. It is used to create, display, modify and otherwise manipulate text
    files. When invoked as <code class="Nm">red</code>, the editor runs in
    &quot;restricted&quot; mode, in which the only difference is that the editor
    restricts the use of filenames which start with
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">!</code>&#x2019; (interpreted as shell commands by
    <code class="Nm">ed</code>) or contain a
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">/</code>&#x2019;. Note that editing outside of the
    current directory is only prohibited if the user does not have write access
    to the current directory. If a user has write access to the current
    directory, then symbolic links can be created in the current directory, in
    which case <code class="Nm">red</code> will not stop the user from editing
    the file that the symbolic link points to.</p>
<p class="Pp">If invoked with a <var class="Ar">file</var> argument, then a copy
    of <var class="Ar">file</var> is read into the editor's buffer. Changes are
    made to this copy and not directly to <var class="Ar">file</var> itself.
    Upon quitting <code class="Nm">ed</code>, any changes not explicitly saved
    with a <i class="Em">w</i> command are lost.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="command">Editing is done in two distinct modes:
    <a class="permalink" href="#command"><i class="Em">command</i></a> and
    <a class="permalink" href="#input"><i class="Em" id="input">input</i></a>.
    When first invoked, <code class="Nm">ed</code> is in command mode. In this
    mode commands are read from the standard input and executed to manipulate
    the contents of the editor buffer. A typical command might look like:</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Cm">,s</code><span class="No">/</span><i class="Em">old</i><span class="No">/</span><i class="Em">new</i><span class="No">/</span><code class="Cm">g</code></p>
<p class="Pp">which replaces all occurrences of the string <i class="Em">old</i>
    with <i class="Em">new</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="a">When an input command, such as
    <a class="permalink" href="#a"><i class="Em">a</i></a> (append),
    <a class="permalink" href="#i"><i class="Em" id="i">i</i></a> (insert) or
    <i class="Em">c</i> (change), is given, <code class="Nm">ed</code> enters
    input mode. This is the primary means of adding text to a file. In this
    mode, no commands are available; instead, the standard input is written
    directly to the editor buffer. Lines consist of text up to and including a
    <a class="permalink" href="#newline"><i class="Em" id="newline">newline</i></a>
    character. Input mode is terminated by entering a single period
    (<a class="permalink" href="#."><i class="Em" id=".">.</i></a>) on a
  line.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="d">All <code class="Nm">ed</code> commands operate on whole
    lines or ranges of lines; e.g., the
    <a class="permalink" href="#d"><i class="Em">d</i></a> command deletes
    lines; the <i class="Em">m</i> command moves lines, and so on. It is
    possible to modify only a portion of a line by means of replacement, as in
    the example above. However even here, the <i class="Em">s</i> command is
    applied to whole lines at a time.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, <code class="Nm">ed</code> commands consist of zero or
    more line addresses, followed by a single character command and possibly
    additional parameters; i.e., commands have the structure:</p>
<p class="Pp">[<var class="Ar">address</var>[,<var class="Ar">address</var>]]<var class="Ar">command</var>[<var class="Ar">parameters</var>]</p>
<p class="Pp">The address(es) indicate the line or range of lines to be affected
    by the command. If fewer addresses are given than the command accepts, then
    default addresses are supplied.</p>

<p class="Pp">The following options are available:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><code class="Fl">-s</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Suppress diagnostics. This should be used if <code class="Nm">ed</code>'s

  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><code class="Fl">-p</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">string</var></dt>
  <dd>Specify a command prompt. This may be toggled on and off with the
      <a class="permalink" href="#P"><i class="Em" id="P">P</i></a>
    command.</dd>
  <dt><var class="Ar">file</var></dt>
  <dd>Specify the name of a file to read. If <var class="Ar">file</var> is
      prefixed with a bang (!), then it is interpreted as a shell command. In
      this case, what is read is the standard output of
      <var class="Ar">file</var> executed via
      <a class="Xr" href="../1/sh">sh(1)</a>. To read a file whose name begins
      with a bang, prefix the name with a backslash (\). The default filename is
      set to <var class="Ar">file</var> only if it is not prefixed with a
    bang.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="LINE_ADDRESSING"><a class="permalink" href="#LINE_ADDRESSING">LINE
  ADDRESSING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">An address represents the number of a line in the buffer. The
    <code class="Nm">ed</code> utility maintains a
    <a class="permalink" href="#current"><i class="Em" id="current">current
    address</i></a> which is typically supplied to commands as the default
    address when none is specified. When a file is first read, the current
    address is set to the last line of the file. In general, the current address
    is set to the last line affected by a command.</p>
<p class="Pp" id="+">A line address is constructed from one of the bases in the
    list below, optionally followed by a numeric offset. The offset may include
    any combination of digits, operators (i.e.,
    <a class="permalink" href="#+"><i class="Em">+</i></a>, <i class="Em">-</i>
    and <i class="Em">^</i>) and whitespace. Addresses are read from left to
    right, and their values are computed relative to the current address.</p>
<p class="Pp">One exception to the rule that addresses represent line numbers is
    the address <i class="Em">0</i> (zero). This means &quot;before the first
    line,&quot; and is legal wherever it makes sense.</p>
<p class="Pp">An address range is two addresses separated either by a comma or
    semi-colon. The value of the first address in a range cannot exceed the
    value of the second. If only one address is given in a range, then the
    second address is set to the given address. If an <i class="Em">n</i>-tuple
    of addresses is given where <i class="Em">n&#x00A0;&gt;&#x00A0;2</i>, then
    the corresponding range is determined by the last two addresses in the
    <i class="Em">n</i>-tuple. If only one address is expected, then the last
    address is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each address in a comma-delimited range is interpreted relative to
    the current address. In a semi-colon-delimited range, the first address is
    used to set the current address, and the second address is interpreted
    relative to the first.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following address symbols are recognized:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>.</dt>
  <dd>The current line (address) in the buffer.</dd>
  <dt>$</dt>
  <dd>The last line in the buffer.</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="REGULAR_EXPRESSIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#REGULAR_EXPRESSIONS">REGULAR
  EXPRESSIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Regular expressions are patterns used in selecting text. For
    example, the command:</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Cm">g</code><span class="No">/</span><i class="Em">string</i><span class="No">/</span></p>
<p class="Pp">prints all lines containing <i class="Em">string</i>. Regular
    expressions are also used by the <i class="Em">s</i> command for selecting
    old text to be replaced with new.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to a specifying string literals, regular expressions
    can represent classes of strings. Strings thus represented are said to be
    matched by the corresponding regular expression. If it is possible for a
    regular expression to match several strings in a line, then the left-most
    longest match is the one selected.</p>

      results. For example, the regular expression
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">b*</code>&#x2019; matches the beginning of the

      <a class="permalink" href="#'lc"><i class="Em">'lc</i></a> (i.e., a single
      quote followed by <i class="Em">lc</i>) in subsequent commands. The mark
      is not cleared until the line is deleted or otherwise modified.</dd>
  <dt>(.,.)l</dt>
  <dd>Print the addressed lines unambiguously. If a single line fills more than
      one screen (as might be the case when viewing a binary file, for
      instance), a &#x201C;<code class="Li">--More--</code>&#x201D; prompt is
      printed on the last line. The <code class="Nm">ed</code> utility waits
      until the RETURN key is pressed before displaying the next screen. The
      current address is set to the last line printed.</dd>
  <dt>(.,.)m(.)</dt>
  <dd>Move lines in the buffer. The addressed lines are moved to after the
      right-hand destination address, which may be the address
      <i class="Em">0</i> (zero). The current address is set to the last line
      moved.</dd>

      without warning.</dd>
  <dt>($)r <var class="Ar">file</var></dt>
  <dd>Read <var class="Ar">file</var> to after the addressed line. If
      <var class="Ar">file</var> is not specified, then the default filename is
      used. If there was no default filename prior to the command, then the
      default filename is set to <var class="Ar">file</var>. Otherwise, the
      default filename is unchanged. The current address is set to the last line
      read.</dd>
  <dt>($)r <var class="Ar">!command</var></dt>
  <dd>Read to after the addressed line the standard output of
      <var class="Ar">!command</var>, (see the <var class="Ar">!command</var>
      below). The default filename is unchanged. The current address is set to
      the last line read.</dd>

  <dd>Replace text in the addressed lines matching a regular expression
      <var class="Ar">re</var> with <var class="Ar">replacement</var>. By
      default, only the first match in each line is replaced. If the
      <i class="Em">g</i> (global) suffix is given, then every match to be
      replaced. The <i class="Em">n</i> suffix, where <i class="Em">n</i> is a
      positive number, causes only the <i class="Em">n</i>th match to be
      replaced. It is an error if no substitutions are performed on any of the
      addressed lines. The current address is set the last line affected.
    <p class="Pp"><var class="Ar">Re</var> and <var class="Ar">replacement</var>
        may be delimited by any character other than space and newline (see the
        <i class="Em">s</i> command below). If one or two of the last delimiters
        is omitted, then the last line affected is printed as though the print
        suffix <i class="Em">p</i> were specified.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An unescaped &#x2018;<code class="Li">&amp;</code>&#x2019; in

        text. The character sequence <i class="Em">\m</i>, where
        <i class="Em">m</i> is a number in the range [1,9], is replaced by the
        <i class="Em">m th</i> backreference expression of the matched text. If
        <var class="Ar">replacement</var> consists of a single
        &#x2018;<code class="Li">%</code>&#x2019;, then
        <var class="Ar">replacement</var> from the last substitution is used.
        Newlines may be embedded in <var class="Ar">replacement</var> if they
        are escaped with a backslash (\).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>(.,.)s</dt>
  <dd>Repeat the last substitution. This form of the <i class="Em">s</i> command
      accepts a count suffix <i class="Em">n</i>, or any combination of the
      characters <i class="Em">r</i>, <i class="Em">g</i>, and
      <i class="Em">p</i>. If a count suffix <i class="Em">n</i> is given, then
      only the <i class="Em">n</i>th match is replaced. The <i class="Em">r</i>
      suffix causes the regular expression of the last search to be used instead
      of the that of the last substitution. The <i class="Em">g</i> suffix
      toggles the global suffix of the last substitution. The
      <i class="Em">p</i> suffix toggles the print suffix of the last
      substitution The current address is set to the last line affected.</dd>
  <dt>(.,.)t(.)</dt>
  <dd>Copy (i.e., transfer) the addressed lines to after the right-hand

      The current address is set to the last line copied.</dd>
  <dt>u</dt>
  <dd>Undo the last command and restores the current address to what it was
      before the command. The global commands <i class="Em">g</i>,
      <i class="Em">G</i>, <i class="Em">v</i>, and <i class="Em">V</i>. are
      treated as a single command by undo. <i class="Em">u</i> is its own

  <dd>Apply <var class="Ar">command-list</var> to each of the addressed lines
      not matching a regular expression <var class="Ar">re</var>. This is

  <dt>(1,$)V/re/</dt>
  <dd>Interactively edit the addressed lines not matching a regular expression
      <var class="Ar">re</var>. This is similar to the <i class="Em">G</i>
      command.</dd>
  <dt>(1,$)w <var class="Ar">file</var></dt>
  <dd>Write the addressed lines to <var class="Ar">file</var>. Any previous
      contents of <var class="Ar">file</var> is lost without warning. If there
      is no default filename, then the default filename is set to
      <var class="Ar">file</var>, otherwise it is unchanged. If no filename is
      specified, then the default filename is used. The current address is

  <dt>(.+1)zn</dt>
  <dd>Scroll <var class="Ar">n</var> lines at a time starting at addressed line.
      If <var class="Ar">n</var> is not specified, then the current window size
      is used. The current address is set to the last line printed.</dd>
  <dt id="_">!command</dt>
  <dd>Execute <var class="Ar">command</var> via

      &#x2018;<code class="Li">!</code>&#x2019;, then it is replaced by text of
      the previous <var class="Ar">!command</var>. The

      <var class="Ar">command</var> for backslash (\) escapes. However, an
      unescaped <a class="permalink" href="#_"><i class="Em">%</i></a> is
      replaced by the default filename. When the shell returns from execution, a
      &#x2018;<code class="Li">!</code>&#x2019; is printed to the standard
      output. The current line is unchanged.</dd>

<p class="Pp">When an error occurs, <code class="Nm">ed</code> prints a
