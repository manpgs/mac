  and Access of Arrays of Arrays</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The simplest two-level data structure to build in Perl is an array
    of arrays, sometimes casually called a list of lists. It's reasonably easy
    to understand, and almost everything that applies here will also be
    applicable later on with the fancier data structures.</p>
<p class="Pp">An array of an array is just a regular old array
    <span class="Li">@AoA</span> that you can get at with two subscripts, like
    <span class="Li">$AoA[3][2]</span>. Here's a declaration of the array:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use 5.010;  # so we can use say()

    # assign to our array, an array of array references
    @AoA = (
           [ &quot;fred&quot;, &quot;barney&quot;, &quot;pebbles&quot;, &quot;bambam&quot;, &quot;dino&quot;, ],
           [ &quot;george&quot;, &quot;jane&quot;, &quot;elroy&quot;, &quot;judy&quot;, ],
           [ &quot;homer&quot;, &quot;bart&quot;, &quot;marge&quot;, &quot;maggie&quot;, ],
    );
    say $AoA[2][1];
  bart
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now you should be very careful that the outer bracket type is a
    round one, that is, a parenthesis. That's because you're assigning to an
    <span class="Li">@array</span>, so you need parentheses. If you wanted there
    <i>not</i> to be an <span class="Li">@AoA</span>, but rather just a
    reference to it, you could do something more like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    # assign a reference to array of array references
    $ref_to_AoA = [
        [ &quot;fred&quot;, &quot;barney&quot;, &quot;pebbles&quot;, &quot;bambam&quot;, &quot;dino&quot;, ],
        [ &quot;george&quot;, &quot;jane&quot;, &quot;elroy&quot;, &quot;judy&quot;, ],
        [ &quot;homer&quot;, &quot;bart&quot;, &quot;marge&quot;, &quot;maggie&quot;, ],
    ];
    say $ref_to_AoA-&gt;[2][1];
  bart
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Notice that the outer bracket type has changed, and so our access
    syntax has also changed. That's because unlike C, in perl you can't freely
    interchange arrays and references thereto.
    <span class="Li">$ref_to_AoA</span> is a reference to an array, whereas
    <span class="Li">@AoA</span> is an array proper. Likewise,
    <span class="Li">$AoA[2]</span> is not an array, but an array ref. So how
    come you can write these:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $AoA[2][2]
    $ref_to_AoA-&gt;[2][2]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">instead of having to write these:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $AoA[2]-&gt;[2]
    $ref_to_AoA-&gt;[2]-&gt;[2]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Well, that's because the rule is that on adjacent brackets only
    (whether square or curly), you are free to omit the pointer dereferencing
    arrow. But you cannot do so for the very first one if it's a scalar
    containing a reference, which means that <span class="Li">$ref_to_AoA</span>
    always needs it.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Growing_Your_Own"><a class="permalink" href="#Growing_Your_Own">Growing
  Your Own</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">That's all well and good for declaration of a fixed data
    structure, but what if you wanted to add new elements on the fly, or build
    it up entirely from scratch?</p>
<p class="Pp">First, let's look at reading it in from a file. This is something
    like adding a row at a time. We'll assume that there's a flat file in which
    each line is a row and each word an element. If you're trying to develop an
    <span class="Li">@AoA</span> array containing all these, here's the right
    way to do that:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        @tmp = split;
        push @AoA, [ @tmp ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You might also have loaded that from a function:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for $i ( 1 .. 10 ) {
        $AoA[$i] = [ somefunc($i) ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or you might have had a temporary variable sitting around with the
    array in it.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for $i ( 1 .. 10 ) {
        @tmp = somefunc($i);
        $AoA[$i] = [ @tmp ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It's important you make sure to use the <span class="Li">&quot;[
    ]&quot;</span> array reference constructor. That's because this wouldn't
    work:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $AoA[$i] = @tmp;   # WRONG!
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The reason that doesn't do what you want is because assigning a
    named array like that to a scalar is taking an array in scalar context,
    which means just counts the number of elements in
    <span class="Li">@tmp</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are running under <span class="Li">&quot;use
    strict&quot;</span> (and if you aren't, why in the world aren't you?),
    you'll have to add some declarations to make it happy:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use strict;
    my(@AoA, @tmp);
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        @tmp = split;
        push @AoA, [ @tmp ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Of course, you don't need the temporary array to have a name at
    all:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        push @AoA, [ split ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You also don't have to use <i>push()</i>. You could just make a
    direct assignment if you knew where you wanted to put it:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    my (@AoA, $i, $line);
    for $i ( 0 .. 10 ) {
        $line = &lt;&gt;;
        $AoA[$i] = [ split &quot; &quot;, $line ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or even just</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    my (@AoA, $i);
    for $i ( 0 .. 10 ) {
        $AoA[$i] = [ split &quot; &quot;, &lt;&gt; ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You should in general be leery of using functions that could
    potentially return lists in scalar context without explicitly stating such.
    This would be clearer to the casual reader:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    my (@AoA, $i);
    for $i ( 0 .. 10 ) {
        $AoA[$i] = [ split &quot; &quot;, scalar(&lt;&gt;) ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you wanted to have a <span class="Li">$ref_to_AoA</span>
    variable as a reference to an array, you'd have to do something like
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        push @$ref_to_AoA, [ split ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now you can add new rows. What about adding new columns? If you're
    dealing with just matrices, it's often easiest to use simple assignment:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for $x (1 .. 10) {
        for $y (1 .. 10) {
            $AoA[$x][$y] = func($x, $y);
        }
    }

    for $x ( 3, 7, 9 ) {
        $AoA[$x][20] += func2($x);
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It doesn't matter whether those elements are already there or not:
    it'll gladly create them for you, setting intervening elements to
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> as need be.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you wanted just to append to a row, you'd have to do something
    a bit funnier looking:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    # add new columns to an existing row
    push @{ $AoA[0] }, &quot;wilma&quot;, &quot;betty&quot;;   # explicit deref
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Prior to Perl 5.14, this wouldn't even compile:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    push $AoA[0], &quot;wilma&quot;, &quot;betty&quot;;        # implicit deref
</pre>
<p class="Pp">How come? Because once upon a time, the argument to <i>push()</i>
    had to be a real array, not just a reference to one. That's no longer true.
    In fact, the line marked &quot;implicit deref&quot; above works just
    fine--in this instance--to do what the one that says explicit deref did.</p>
<p class="Pp">The reason I said &quot;in this instance&quot; is because that
    <i>only</i> works because <span class="Li">$AoA[0]</span> already held an
    array reference. If you try that on an undefined variable, you'll take an
    exception. That's because the implicit derefererence will never autovivify
    an undefined variable the way <span class="Li">&quot;@{ }&quot;</span>
    always will:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    my $aref = undef;
    push $aref,  qw(some more values);  # WRONG!
    push @$aref, qw(a few more);        # ok
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you want to take advantage of this new implicit dereferencing
    behavior, go right ahead: it makes code easier on the eye and wrist. Just
    understand that older releases will choke on it during compilation. Whenever
    you make use of something that works only in some given release of Perl and
    later, but not earlier, you should place a prominent</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use v5.14;   # needed for implicit deref of array refs by array ops
</pre>
<p class="Pp">directive at the top of the file that needs it. That way when
    somebody tries to run the new code under an old perl, rather than getting an
    error like</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    Type of arg 1 to push must be array (not array element) at /tmp/a line 8, near &quot;&quot;betty&quot;;&quot;
    Execution of /tmp/a aborted due to compilation errors.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">they'll be politely informed that</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    Perl v5.14.0 required--this is only v5.12.3, stopped at /tmp/a line 1.
    BEGIN failed--compilation aborted at /tmp/a line 1.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Access_and_Printing"><a class="permalink" href="#Access_and_Printing">Access
  and Printing</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Now it's time to print your data structure out. How are you going
    to do that? Well, if you want only one of the elements, it's trivial:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    print $AoA[0][0];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you want to print the whole thing, though, you can't say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    print @AoA;         # WRONG
</pre>
<p class="Pp">because you'll get just references listed, and perl will never
    automatically dereference things for you. Instead, you have to roll yourself
    a loop or two. This prints the whole structure, using the shell-style
    <i>for()</i> construct to loop across the outer set of subscripts.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for $aref ( @AoA ) {
        say &quot;\t [ @$aref ],&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you wanted to keep track of subscripts, you might do this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for $i ( 0 .. $#AoA ) {
        say &quot;\t elt $i is [ @{$AoA[$i]} ],&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or maybe even this. Notice the inner loop.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for $i ( 0 .. $#AoA ) {
        for $j ( 0 .. $#{$AoA[$i]} ) {
            say &quot;elt $i $j is $AoA[$i][$j]&quot;;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As you can see, it's getting a bit complicated. That's why
    sometimes is easier to take a temporary on your way through:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for $i ( 0 .. $#AoA ) {
        $aref = $AoA[$i];
        for $j ( 0 .. $#{$aref} ) {
            say &quot;elt $i $j is $AoA[$i][$j]&quot;;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Hmm... that's still a bit ugly. How about this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for $i ( 0 .. $#AoA ) {
        $aref = $AoA[$i];
        $n = @$aref - 1;
        for $j ( 0 .. $n ) {
            say &quot;elt $i $j is $AoA[$i][$j]&quot;;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When you get tired of writing a custom print for your data
    structures, you might look at the standard Dumpvalue or Data::Dumper
    modules. The former is what the Perl debugger uses, while the latter
    generates parsable Perl code. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use v5.14;     # using the + prototype, new to v5.14

    sub show(+) {
        require Dumpvalue;
        state $prettily = new Dumpvalue::
                            tick        =&gt; q(&quot;),
                            compactDump =&gt; 1,  # comment these two lines out
                            veryCompact =&gt; 1,  # if you want a bigger dump
                        ;
        dumpValue $prettily @_;
    }

    # Assign a list of array references to an array.
    my @AoA = (
           [ &quot;fred&quot;, &quot;barney&quot; ],
           [ &quot;george&quot;, &quot;jane&quot;, &quot;elroy&quot; ],
           [ &quot;homer&quot;, &quot;marge&quot;, &quot;bart&quot; ],
    );
    push $AoA[0], &quot;wilma&quot;, &quot;betty&quot;;
    show @AoA;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will print out:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    0  0..3  &quot;fred&quot; &quot;barney&quot; &quot;wilma&quot; &quot;betty&quot;
    1  0..2  &quot;george&quot; &quot;jane&quot; &quot;elroy&quot;
    2  0..2  &quot;homer&quot; &quot;marge&quot; &quot;bart&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Whereas if you comment out the two lines I said you might wish to,
    then it shows it to you this way instead:</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Slices"><a class="permalink" href="#Slices">Slices</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If you want to get at a slice (part of a row) in a
    multidimensional array, you're going to have to do some fancy subscripting.
    That's because while we have a nice synonym for single elements via the
    pointer arrow for dereferencing, no such convenience exists for slices.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's how to do one operation using a loop. We'll assume an
    <span class="Li">@AoA</span> variable as before.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @part = ();
    $x = 4;
    for ($y = 7; $y &lt; 13; $y++) {
        push @part, $AoA[$x][$y];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That same loop could be replaced with a slice operation:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @part = @{$AoA[4]}[7..12];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or spaced out a bit:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @part = @{ $AoA[4] } [ 7..12 ];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But as you might well imagine, this can get pretty rough on the
    reader.</p>
<p class="Pp">Ah, but what if you wanted a <i>two-dimensional slice</i>, such as
    having <span class="Li">$x</span> run from 4..8 and
    <span class="Li">$y</span> run from 7 to 12? Hmm... here's the simple
  way:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @newAoA = ();
    for ($startx = $x = 4; $x &lt;= 8; $x++) {
        for ($starty = $y = 7; $y &lt;= 12; $y++) {
            $newAoA[$x - $startx][$y - $starty] = $AoA[$x][$y];
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We can reduce some of the looping through slices</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    for ($x = 4; $x &lt;= 8; $x++) {
        push @newAoA, [ @{ $AoA[$x] } [ 7..12 ] ];
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you were into Schwartzian Transforms, you would probably have
    selected map for that</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @newAoA = map { [ @{ $AoA[$_] } [ 7..12 ] ] } 4 .. 8;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Although if your manager accused you of seeking job security (or
    rapid insecurity) through inscrutable code, it would be hard to argue. :-)
    If I were you, I'd put that in a function:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @newAoA = splice_2D( \@AoA, 4 =&gt; 8, 7 =&gt; 12 );
    sub splice_2D {

        my ($x_lo, $x_hi,
            $y_lo, $y_hi) = @_;

        return map {
            [ @{ $lrr-&gt;[$_] } [ $y_lo .. $y_hi ] ]
        } $x_lo .. $x_hi;
