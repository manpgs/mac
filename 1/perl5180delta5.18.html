<h2 class="Ss" id="New_mechanism_for_experimental_features"><a class="permalink" href="#New_mechanism_for_experimental_features">New
  mechanism for experimental features</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Newly-added experimental features will now require this
    incantation:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    no warnings &quot;experimental::feature_name&quot;;
    use feature &quot;feature_name&quot;;  # would warn without the prev line
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There is a new warnings category, called &quot;experimental&quot;,
    containing warnings that the feature pragma emits when enabling experimental
    features.</p>
<p class="Pp">Newly-added experimental features will also be given special
    warning IDs, which consist of &quot;experimental::&quot; followed by the
    name of the feature. (The plan is to extend this mechanism eventually to all
    warnings, to allow them to be enabled or disabled individually, and not just
    by category.)</p>
<p class="Pp">By saying</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    no warnings &quot;experimental::feature_name&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">you are taking responsibility for any breakage that future changes
    to, or removal of, the feature may cause.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since some features (like <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span>
    or <span class="Li">&quot;my $_&quot;</span>) now emit experimental
    warnings, and you may want to disable them in code that is also run on perls
    that do not recognize these warning categories, consider using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span> pragma like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    no if $] &gt;= 5.018, warnings =&gt; &quot;experimental::feature_name&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Existing experimental features may begin emitting these warnings,
    too. Please consult perlexperiment for information on which features are

<h2 class="Ss" id="Hash_overhaul"><a class="permalink" href="#Hash_overhaul">Hash
  overhaul</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Changes to the implementation of hashes in perl v5.18.0 will be
    one of the most visible changes to the behavior of existing code.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, two distinct hash variables with identical keys and
    values may now provide their contents in a different order where it was
    previously identical.</p>
<p class="Pp">When encountering these changes, the key to cleaning up from them
    is to accept that <b>hashes are unordered collections</b> and to act
    accordingly.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Hash randomization</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The seed used by Perl's hash function is now random. This means
    that the order which keys/values will be returned from functions like
    <span class="Li">&quot;keys()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;values()&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;each()&quot;</span> will differ from run to run.</p>
<p class="Pp">This change was introduced to make Perl's hashes more robust to
    algorithmic complexity attacks, and also because we discovered that it
    exposes hash ordering dependency bugs and makes them easier to track
  down.</p>
<p class="Pp">Toolchain maintainers might want to invest in additional
    infrastructure to test for things like this. Running tests several times in
    a row and then comparing results will make it easier to spot hash order
    dependencies in code. Authors are strongly encouraged not to expose the key
    order of Perl's hashes to insecure audiences.</p>
<p class="Pp">Further, every hash has its own iteration order, which should make
    it much more difficult to determine what the current hash seed is.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>New hash functions</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Perl v5.18 includes support for multiple hash functions, and
    changed the default (to ONE_AT_A_TIME_HARD), you can choose a different
    algorithm by defining a symbol at compile time. For a current list, consult
    the <i>INSTALL</i> document. Note that as of Perl v5.18 we can only
    recommend use of the default or SIPHASH. All the others are known to have
    security issues and are for research purposes only.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>PERL_HASH_SEED environment variable now takes a hex
  value</i></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;PERL_HASH_SEED&quot;</span> no longer
    accepts an integer as a parameter; instead the value is expected to be a
    binary value encoded in a hex string, such as
    &quot;0xf5867c55039dc724&quot;. This is to make the infrastructure support
    hash seeds of arbitrary lengths, which might exceed that of an integer.
    (SipHash uses a 16 byte seed.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>PERL_PERTURB_KEYS environment variable added</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot;</span>
    environment variable allows one to control the level of randomization
    applied to <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span> and friends.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot;</span> is 0,
    perl will not randomize the key order at all. The chance that
    <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span> changes due to an insert will be
    the same as in previous perls, basically only when the bucket size is
    changed.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot;</span> is 1,
    perl will randomize keys in a non-repeatable way. The chance that
    <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span> changes due to an insert will be
    very high. This is the most secure and default mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot;</span> is 2,
    perl will randomize keys in a repeatable way. Repeated runs of the same
    program should produce the same output every time.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;PERL_HASH_SEED&quot;</span> implies a
    non-default <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot;</span> setting.
    Setting <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_HASH_SEED=0&quot;</span> (exactly one 0)
    implies <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS=0&quot;</span> (hash key
    randomization disabled); settng
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_HASH_SEED&quot;</span> to any other value
    implies <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS=2&quot;</span>
    (deterministic and repeatable hash key randomization). Specifying
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_PERTURB_KEYS&quot;</span> explicitly to a
    different level overrides this behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>Hash::Util::hash_seed()</i><i> now returns a
  string</i></p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Hash::Util::hash_seed()</i> now returns a string instead of an
    integer. This is to make the infrastructure support hash seeds of arbitrary
    lengths which might exceed that of an integer. (SipHash uses a 16 byte
    seed.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Output of PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG has been changed</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The environment variable PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG now makes perl show
    both the hash function perl was built with, <i>and</i> the seed, in hex, in
    use for that process. Code parsing this output, should it exist, must change
    to accommodate the new format. Example of the new format:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $ PERL_HASH_SEED_DEBUG=1 ./perl -e1
    HASH_FUNCTION = MURMUR3 HASH_SEED = 0x1476bb9f

  Restrictions in Multi-Character Case-Insensitive Matching in Regular
  Expression Bracketed Character Classes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Unicode has now withdrawn their previous recommendation for
    regular expressions to automatically handle cases where a single character
    can match multiple characters case-insensitively, for example, the letter
    LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S and the sequence
    <span class="Li">&quot;ss&quot;</span>. This is because it turns out to be
    impracticable to do this correctly in all circumstances. Because Perl has
    tried to do this as best it can, it will continue to do so. (We are
    considering an option to turn it off.) However, a new restriction is being
    added on such matches when they occur in [bracketed] character classes.
    People were specifying things such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;/[\0-\xff]/i&quot;</span>, and being surprised that
    it matches the two character sequence <span class="Li">&quot;ss&quot;</span>
    (since LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S occurs in this range). This behavior is
    also inconsistent with using a property instead of a range:
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Block=Latin1}&quot;</span> also includes LATIN
    SMALL LETTER SHARP S, but
    <span class="Li">&quot;/[\p{Block=Latin1}]/i&quot;</span> does not match
    <span class="Li">&quot;ss&quot;</span>. The new rule is that for there to be
    a multi-character case-insensitive match within a bracketed character class,
    the character must be explicitly listed, and not as an end point of a range.
    This more closely obeys the Principle of Least Astonishment. See
    &quot;Bracketed Character Classes&quot; in perlrecharclass. Note that a bug
    [perl #89774], now fixed as part of this change, prevented the previous
    behavior from working fully.</p>

  rules for variable names and identifiers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Due to an oversight, single character variable names in v5.16 were
    completely unrestricted. This opened the door to several kinds of insanity.
    As of v5.18, these now follow the rules of other identifiers, in addition to
    accepting characters that match the
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{POSIX_Punct}&quot;</span> property.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is no longer any difference in the parsing of identifiers
    specified by using braces versus without braces. For instance, perl used to
    allow <span class="Li">&quot;${foo:bar}&quot;</span> (with a single colon)
    but not <span class="Li">$foo:bar</span>. Now that both are handled by a
    single code path, they are both treated the same way: both are forbidden.

<p class="Pp">Literal vertical tabs in a regex literal are ignored when the

  smartmatch family of features are now experimental</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Smart match, added in v5.10.0 and significantly revised in
    v5.10.1, has been a regular point of complaint. Although there are a number
    of ways in which it is useful, it has also proven problematic and confusing
    for both users and implementors of Perl. There have been a number of
    proposals on how to best address the problem. It is clear that smartmatch is
    almost certainly either going to change or go away in the future. Relying on
    its current behavior is not recommended.</p>
<p class="Pp">Warnings will now be issued when the parser sees
    <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span>. To disable these warnings, you can
    add this line to the appropriate scope:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  no if $] &gt;= 5.018, warnings =&gt; &quot;experimental::smartmatch&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Consider, though, replacing the use of these features, as they may
    change behavior again before becoming stable.</p>

  $_ is now experimental</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Since it was introduced in Perl v5.10, it has caused much
    confusion with no obvious solution:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Various modules (e.g., List::Util) expect callback routines to use the
      global <span class="Li">$_</span>. <span class="Li">&quot;use List::Util
      'first'; my $_; first { $_ == 1 } @list&quot;</span> does not work as one
      would expect.</li>
  <li>A <span class="Li">&quot;my $_&quot;</span> declaration earlier in the
      same file can cause confusing closure warnings.</li>
  <li>The &quot;_&quot; subroutine prototype character allows called subroutines
      to access your lexical <span class="Li">$_</span>, so it is not really
      private after all.</li>
  <li>Nevertheless, subroutines with a &quot;(@)&quot; prototype and methods
      cannot access the caller's lexical <span class="Li">$_</span>, unless they
      are written in XS.</li>
  <li>But even XS routines cannot access a lexical <span class="Li">$_</span>
      declared, not in the calling subroutine, but in an outer scope, iff that
      subroutine happened not to mention <span class="Li">$_</span> or use any
      operators that default to <span class="Li">$_</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">It is our hope that lexical <span class="Li">$_</span> can be
    rehabilitated, but this may cause changes in its behavior. Please use it
    with caution until it becomes stable.</p>

<p class="Pp">Usages like this, where they are interpreted as metacharacters,

    change the behavior in future Perl versions so that the backslashes do have
    an effect, and without fear that we are silently breaking any existing

<p class="Pp">In theory, you can currently build perl without PerlIO. Instead,
    you'd use a wrapper around stdio or sfio. In practice, this isn't very
    useful. It's not well tested, and without any support for IO layers or
    (thus) Unicode, it's not much of a perl. Building without PerlIO will most
    likely be removed in the next version of perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">PerlIO supports a <span class="Li">&quot;stdio&quot;</span> layer
    if stdio use is desired. Similarly a sfio layer could be produced in the
    future, if needed.</p>

  <dd>Platforms without support infrastructure
    <p class="Pp">Both Windows CE and z/OS have been historically
        under-maintained, and are currently neither successfully building nor
        regularly being smoke tested. Efforts are underway to change this
        situation, but it should not be taken for granted that the platforms are
        safe and supported. If they do not become buildable and regularly
        smoked, support for them may be actively removed in future releases. If
        you have an interest in these platforms and you can lend your time,
        expertise, or hardware to help support these platforms, please let the
        perl development effort know by emailing
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl5-porters@perl.org&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Some platforms that appear otherwise entirely dead are also on
        the short list for removal between now and v5.20.0:</p>

<p class="Pp">We also think it likely that current versions of Perl will no
    longer build AmigaOS, DJGPP, NetWare (natively), OS/2 and Plan 9. If you are
    using Perl on such a platform and have an interest in ensuring Perl's future
    on them, please contact us.</p>
<p class="Pp">We believe that Perl has long been unable to build on mixed endian
    architectures (such as PDP-11s), and intend to remove any remaining support
    code. Similarly, code supporting the long umaintained GNU dld will be
    removed soon if no-one makes themselves known as an active user.</p>

  <li>Swapping of $&lt; and $&gt;
    <p class="Pp">Perl has supported the idiom of swapping $&lt; and $&gt; (and
        likewise $( and $)) to temporarily drop permissions since 5.0, like
        this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    ($&lt;, $&gt;) = ($&gt;, $&lt;);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">However, this idiom modifies the real user/group id, which can
        have undesirable side-effects, is no longer useful on any platform perl
        supports and complicates the implementation of these variables and list
        assignment in general.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As an alternative, assignment only to
        <span class="Li">$&gt;</span> is recommended:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    local $&gt; = $&lt;;

  <li>Revamping <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span> semantics in
      double-quotish strings when combined with other escapes.
    <p class="Pp">There are several bugs and inconsistencies involving
        combinations of <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span> and escapes like
        <span class="Li">&quot;\x&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;\L&quot;</span>, etc., within a
        <span class="Li">&quot;\Q...\E&quot;</span> pair. These need to be
        fixed, and doing so will necessarily change current behavior. The
        changes have not yet been settled.</p>

  <li>Use of <span class="Li">$x</span>, where
      <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span> stands for any actual (non-printing)
      C0 control character will be disallowed in a future Perl version. Use
      <span class="Li">&quot;${x}&quot;</span> instead (where again
      <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span> stands for a control character), or
      better, <span class="Li">$^A</span> , where
      <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span> is a caret (CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT), and

  <li>Lists of lexical variable declarations (<span class="Li">&quot;my($x,
      $y)&quot;</span>) are now optimised down to a single op and are hence
      faster than before.</li>
  <li>A new C preprocessor define
      <span class="Li">&quot;NO_TAINT_SUPPORT&quot;</span> was added that, if
      set, disables Perl's taint support altogether. Using the -T or -t command
      line flags will cause a fatal error. Beware that both core tests as well
      as many a CPAN distribution's tests will fail with this change. On the
      upside, it provides a small performance benefit due to reduced branching.
    <p class="Pp"><b>Do not enable this unless you know exactly what you are
        getting yourself</b> <b>into.</b></p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span> with constant arguments is now

  <li>Speed up in regular expression matching against Unicode properties. The
      largest gain is for <span class="Li">&quot;\X&quot;</span>, the Unicode
      &quot;extended grapheme cluster.&quot; The gain for it is about 35% - 40%.
      Bracketed character classes, e.g.,
      <span class="Li">&quot;[0-9\x{100}]&quot;</span> containing code points
      above 255 are also now faster.</li>
  <li>On platforms supporting it, several former macros are now implemented as
      static inline functions. This should speed things up slightly on non-GCC
      platforms.</li>
  <li>The optimisation of hashes in boolean context has been extended to affect
      <span class="Li">&quot;scalar(%hash)&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;%hash ? ... : ...&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;sub { %hash || ... }&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Filetest operators manage the stack in a fractionally more efficient
      manner.</li>
  <li>Globs used in a numeric context are now numified directly in most cases,
      rather than being numified via stringification.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span> repetition operator is now
      folded to a single constant at compile time if called in scalar context
      with constant operands and no parentheses around the left operand.</li>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Formerly, whichever of <span class="Li">&quot;use bigint&quot;</span> or

  <li>Using any of these three pragmata would cause
      <span class="Li">&quot;hex&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;oct&quot;</span> anywhere else in the program to
      evalute their arguments in list context and prevent them from inferring
      <span class="Li">$_</span> when called without arguments.</li>

  <li>The global overrides that facilitate lexical use of
      <span class="Li">&quot;hex&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;oct&quot;</span> now respect any existing overrides

    <p class="Pp">File::Glob has had exactly the same fix as File::DosGlob.
        Since it is what Perl's own <span class="Li">&quot;glob&quot;</span>
        operator itself uses (except on VMS), this means
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval 'scalar &lt;*&gt;'&quot;</span> no longer
        leaks.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A space-separated list of patterns return long lists of
        results no longer results in memory corruption or crashes. This bug was
        introduced in Perl 5.16.0. [perl #114984]</p>
  </li>
  <li>File::Spec::Unix has been upgraded to 3.40.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;abs2rel&quot;</span> could produce
        incorrect results when given two relative paths or the root directory
        twice [perl #111510].</p>
  </li>
  <li>File::stat has been upgraded to 1.07.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;File::stat&quot;</span> ignores the
        filetest pragma, and warns when used in combination therewith. But it
        was not warning for <span class="Li">&quot;-r&quot;</span>. This has
        been fixed [perl #111640].</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;-p&quot;</span> now works, and does not
        return false for pipes [perl #111638].</p>
    <p class="Pp">Previously <span class="Li">&quot;File::stat&quot;</span>'s
        overloaded <span class="Li">&quot;-x&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-X&quot;</span> operators did not give the
        correct results for directories or executable files when running as
        root. They had been treating executable permissions for root just like
        for any other user, performing group membership tests <i>etc</i> for
        files not owned by root. They now follow the correct Unix behaviour -
        for a directory they are always true, and for a file if any of the three
        execute permission bits are set then they report that root can execute
        the file. Perl's builtin <span class="Li">&quot;-x&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-X&quot;</span> operators have always been
        correct.</p>
  </li>
  <li>File::Temp has been upgraded to 0.23
    <p class="Pp">Fixes various bugs involving directory removal. Defers
        unlinking tempfiles if the initial unlink fails, which fixes problems on
        NFS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>GDBM_File has been upgraded to 1.15.
    <p class="Pp">The undocumented optional fifth parameter to
        <span class="Li">&quot;TIEHASH&quot;</span> has been removed. This was
        intended to provide control of the callback used by
        <span class="Li">&quot;gdbm*&quot;</span> functions in case of fatal
        errors (such as filesystem problems), but did not work (and could never
        have worked). No code on CPAN even attempted to use it. The callback is
        now always the previous default,
        <span class="Li">&quot;croak&quot;</span>. Problems on some platforms
        with how the <span class="Li">&quot;C&quot;</span>
        <span class="Li">&quot;croak&quot;</span> function is called have also
        been resolved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Hash::Util has been upgraded to 0.15.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;hash_unlocked&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;hashref_unlocked&quot;</span> now returns true if
        the hash is unlocked, instead of always returning false [perl
      #112126].</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;hash_unlocked&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;hashref_unlocked&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;lock_hash_recurse&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;unlock_hash_recurse&quot;</span> are now
        exportable [perl #112126].</p>
    <p class="Pp">Two new functions,
        <span class="Li">&quot;hash_locked&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;hashref_locked&quot;</span>, have been added.
        Oddly enough, these two functions were already exported, even though
        they did not exist [perl #112126].</p>
  </li>
  <li>HTTP::Tiny has been upgraded to 0.025.
    <p class="Pp">Add SSL verification features [github #6], [github #9].</p>
    <p class="Pp">Include the final URL in the response hashref.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Add <span class="Li">&quot;local_address&quot;</span>
      option.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This improves SSL support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>IO has been upgraded to 1.28.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;sync()&quot;</span> can now be called
        on read-only file handles [perl #64772].</p>
    <p class="Pp">IO::Socket tries harder to cache or otherwise fetch socket
        information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>IPC::Cmd has been upgraded to 0.80.
    <p class="Pp">Use <span class="Li">&quot;POSIX::_exit&quot;</span> instead
        of <span class="Li">&quot;exit&quot;</span> in
        <span class="Li">&quot;run_forked&quot;</span> [rt.cpan.org #76901].</p>
  </li>
  <li>IPC::Open3 has been upgraded to 1.13.
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;open3()&quot;</span> function no
        longer uses <span class="Li">&quot;POSIX::close()&quot;</span> to close
        file descriptors since that breaks the ref-counting of file descriptors
        done by PerlIO in cases where the file descriptors are shared by PerlIO
        streams, leading to attempts to close the file descriptors a second time
        when any such PerlIO streams are closed later on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Locale::Codes has been upgraded to 3.25.
    <p class="Pp">It includes some new codes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Memoize has been upgraded to 1.03.
    <p class="Pp">Fix the <span class="Li">&quot;MERGE&quot;</span> cache
        option.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Module::Build has been upgraded to 0.4003.
    <p class="Pp">Fixed bug where modules without
        <span class="Li">$VERSION</span> might have a version of '0' listed in
        'provides' metadata, which will be rejected by PAUSE.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Fixed bug in PodParser to allow numerals in module names.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Fixed bug where giving arguments twice led to them becoming
        arrays, resulting in install paths like
        <i></i><i>ARRAY</i><i>(0xdeadbeef)/lib/Foo.pm</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A minor bug fix allows markup to be used around the leading
        &quot;Name&quot; in a POD &quot;abstract&quot; line, and some
        documentation improvements have been made.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Module::CoreList has been upgraded to 2.90
    <p class="Pp">Version information is now stored as a delta, which greatly
        reduces the size of the <i>CoreList.pm</i> file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This restores compatibility with older versions of perl and
        cleans up the corelist data for various modules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Module::Load::Conditional has been upgraded to 0.54.
    <p class="Pp">Fix use of <span class="Li">&quot;requires&quot;</span> on
        perls installed to a path with spaces.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Various enhancements include the new use of
      Module::Metadata.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Module::Metadata has been upgraded to 1.000011.
    <p class="Pp">The creation of a Module::Metadata object for a typical module
        file has been sped up by about 40%, and some spurious warnings about
        <span class="Li">$VERSION</span>s have been suppressed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Module::Pluggable has been upgraded to 4.7.
    <p class="Pp">Amongst other changes, triggers are now allowed on events,
        which gives a powerful way to modify behaviour.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Net::Ping has been upgraded to 2.41.
    <p class="Pp">This fixes some test failures on Windows.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Opcode has been upgraded to 1.25.
    <p class="Pp">Reflect the removal of the boolkeys opcode and the addition of
        the clonecv, introcv and padcv opcodes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>overload has been upgraded to 1.22.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;no overload&quot;</span> now warns for
        invalid arguments, just like <span class="Li">&quot;use
        overload&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>PerlIO::encoding has been upgraded to 0.16.
    <p class="Pp">This is the module implementing the &quot;:encoding(...)&quot;
        I/O layer. It no longer corrupts memory or crashes when the encoding
        back-end reallocates the buffer or gives it a typeglob or shared hash
        key scalar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>PerlIO::scalar has been upgraded to 0.16.
    <p class="Pp">The buffer scalar supplied may now only contain code pounts
        0xFF or lower. [perl #109828]</p>
  </li>
  <li>Perl::OSType has been upgraded to 1.003.
    <p class="Pp">This fixes a bug detecting the VOS operating system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Pod::Html has been upgraded to 1.18.
    <p class="Pp">The option <span class="Li">&quot;--libpods&quot;</span> has
        been reinstated. It is deprecated, and its use does nothing other than
        issue a warning that it is no longer supported.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Since the HTML files generated by pod2html claim to have a
        UTF-8 charset, actually write the files out using UTF-8 [perl
      #111446].</p>
  </li>
  <li>Pod::Simple has been upgraded to 3.28.
    <p class="Pp">Numerous improvements have been made, mostly to
        Pod::Simple::XHTML, which also has a compatibility change: the
        <span class="Li">&quot;codes_in_verbatim&quot;</span> option is now
        disabled by default. See <i>cpan/Pod-Simple/ChangeLog</i> for the full
        details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>re has been upgraded to 0.23
    <p class="Pp">Single character [class]es like
        <span class="Li">&quot;/[s]/&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;/[s]/i&quot;</span> are now optimized as if they
        did not have the brackets, i.e. <span class="Li">&quot;/s/&quot;</span>
        or <span class="Li">&quot;/s/i&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See note about <span class="Li">&quot;op_comp&quot;</span> in
        the &quot;Internal Changes&quot; section below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Safe has been upgraded to 2.35.
    <p class="Pp">Fix interactions with
        <span class="Li">&quot;Devel::Cover&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Don't eval code under <span class="Li">&quot;no
        strict&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Scalar::Util has been upgraded to version 1.27.
    <p class="Pp">Fix an overloading issue with
        <span class="Li">&quot;sum&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;first&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;reduce&quot;</span> now check the callback first
        (so <span class="Li">&amp;first(1)</span> is disallowed).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Fix <span class="Li">&quot;tainted&quot;</span> on magical
        values [rt.cpan.org #55763].</p>
    <p class="Pp">Fix <span class="Li">&quot;sum&quot;</span> on previously
        magical values [rt.cpan.org #61118].</p>
    <p class="Pp">Fix reading past the end of a fixed buffer [rt.cpan.org
        #72700].</p>
  </li>
  <li>Search::Dict has been upgraded to 1.07.
    <p class="Pp">No longer require <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span> on
        filehandles.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Use <span class="Li">&quot;fc&quot;</span> for
      casefolding.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Socket has been upgraded to 2.009.
    <p class="Pp">Constants and functions required for IP multicast source group
        membership have been added.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;unpack_sockaddr_in()&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;unpack_sockaddr_in6()&quot;</span> now return
        just the IP address in scalar context, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;inet_ntop()&quot;</span> now guards against
        incorrect length scalars being passed in.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This fixes an uninitialized memory read.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Storable has been upgraded to 2.41.
    <p class="Pp">Modifying <span class="Li">$_[0]</span> within
        <span class="Li">&quot;STORABLE_freeze&quot;</span> no longer results in
        crashes [perl #112358].</p>
    <p class="Pp">An object whose class implements
        <span class="Li">&quot;STORABLE_attach&quot;</span> is now thawed only
        once when there are multiple references to it in the structure being
        thawed [perl #111918].</p>
    <p class="Pp">Restricted hashes were not always thawed correctly [perl
        #73972].</p>
    <p class="Pp">Storable would croak when freezing a blessed REF object with a
        <span class="Li">&quot;STORABLE_freeze()&quot;</span> method [perl
        #113880].</p>
    <p class="Pp">It can now freeze and thaw vstrings correctly. This causes a
        slight incompatible change in the storage format, so the format version
        has increased to 2.9.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This contains various bugfixes, including compatibility fixes
        for older versions of Perl and vstring handling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Sys::Syslog has been upgraded to 0.32.
    <p class="Pp">This contains several bug fixes relating to
        <span class="Li">&quot;getservbyname()&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;setlogsock()&quot;</span>and log levels in
        <span class="Li">&quot;syslog()&quot;</span>, together with fixes for
        Windows, Haiku-OS and GNU/kFreeBSD. See <i>cpan/Sys-Syslog/Changes</i>
        for the full details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Term::ANSIColor has been upgraded to 4.02.
    <p class="Pp">Add support for italics.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Improve error handling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Term::ReadLine has been upgraded to 1.10. This fixes the use of the
      <b>cpan</b> and <b>cpanp</b> shells on Windows in the event that the
      current drive happens to contain a <i>\dev\tty</i> file.</li>
  <li>Test::Harness has been upgraded to 3.26.
    <p class="Pp">Fix glob semantics on Win32 [rt.cpan.org #49732].</p>
    <p class="Pp">Don't use
        <span class="Li">&quot;Win32::GetShortPathName&quot;</span> when calling
        perl [rt.cpan.org #47890].</p>
    <p class="Pp">Ignore -T when reading shebang [rt.cpan.org #64404].</p>
    <p class="Pp">Handle the case where we don't know the wait status of the
        test more gracefully.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Make the test summary 'ok' line overridable so that it can be
        changed to a plugin to make the output of prove idempotent.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Don't run world-writable files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Text::Tabs and Text::Wrap have been upgraded to 2012.0818. Support for
      Unicode combining characters has been added to them both.</li>
  <li>threads::shared has been upgraded to 1.31.
    <p class="Pp">This adds the option to warn about or ignore attempts to clone
        structures that can't be cloned, as opposed to just unconditionally
        dying in that case.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This adds support for dual-valued values as created by
        Scalar::Util::dualvar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Tie::StdHandle has been upgraded to 4.3.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;READ&quot;</span> now respects the
        offset argument to <span class="Li">&quot;read&quot;</span> [perl
        #112826].</p>
  </li>
  <li>Time::Local has been upgraded to 1.2300.
    <p class="Pp">Seconds values greater than 59 but less than 60 no longer
        cause <span class="Li">&quot;timegm()&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;timelocal()&quot;</span> to croak.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Unicode::UCD has been upgraded to 0.53.
    <p class="Pp">This adds a function <i>all_casefolds()</i> that returns all
        the casefolds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Win32 has been upgraded to 0.47.
    <p class="Pp">New APIs have been added for getting and setting the current

  <li>Subroutine &quot;&amp;%s&quot; is not available
    <p class="Pp">(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or
        eval is attempting to capture an outer lexical subroutine that is not
        currently available. This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the
        lexical subroutine may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that
        has not yet been created. (Remember that named subs are created at
        compile time, while anonymous subs are created at run-time.) For
        example,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    sub { my sub a {...} sub f { \&amp;a } }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current
        the &quot;a&quot; sub, since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been
        created yet. Conversely, the following won't give a warning since the
        anonymous subroutine has by now been created and is live:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>

      Previously, quotes on the verb were passed through to DCL, which would

      In 2005 the documentation was updated to specify a void return value, but
      <i>SvUPGRADE()</i> was left always returning 1 for backwards

  <li>Perl has a new copy-on-write mechanism that allows any SvPOK scalar to be
      upgraded to a copy-on-write scalar. A reference count on the string buffer
      is stored in the string buffer itself. This feature is <b>not enabled
      by</b> <b>default</b>.
    <p class="Pp">It can be enabled in a perl build by running <i>Configure</i>
        with <b>-Accflags=-DPERL_NEW_COPY_ON_WRITE</b>, and we would encourage
        XS authors to try their code with such an enabled perl, and provide

        code to cope with COW. Until such a document is available, consult the
        perl5-porters mailing list.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It breaks a few XS modules by allowing copy-on-write scalars
        to go through code paths that never encountered them before.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Copy-on-write no longer uses the SvFAKE and SvREADONLY flags. Hence,
      SvREADONLY indicates a true read-only SV.
    <p class="Pp">Use the SvIsCOW macro (as before) to identify a copy-on-write
        scalar.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;PL_glob_index&quot;</span> is gone.</li>
  <li>The private Perl_croak_no_modify has had its context parameter removed. It

      remain unaffected.</li>
  <li>Copy-on-write (shared hash key) scalars are no longer marked read-only.
      <span class="Li">&quot;SvREADONLY&quot;</span> returns false on such an
      SV, but <span class="Li">&quot;SvIsCOW&quot;</span> still returns
    true.</li>
  <li>A new op type, <span class="Li">&quot;OP_PADRANGE&quot;</span> has been
      introduced. The perl peephole optimiser will, where possible, substitute a
      single padrange op for a pushmark followed by one or more pad ops, and
      possibly also skipping list and nextstate ops. In addition, the op can
      carry out the tasks associated with the RHS of a
      <span class="Li">&quot;my(...) = @_&quot;</span> assignment, so those ops
      may be optimised away too.</li>
  <li>Case-insensitive matching inside a [bracketed] character class with a

      circumstances that it used to. [perl #89774].</li>

  <li>The regular expression engine no longer reads one byte past the end of the

      never have been a problem, this change facilitates clever tricks with
      string buffers in CPAN modules. [perl #73542]</li>
  <li>Inside a BEGIN block, <span class="Li">&quot;PL_compcv&quot;</span> now
      points to the currently-compiling subroutine, rather than the BEGIN block

      <span class="Li">&quot;sv_len_utf8&quot;</span> were both buggy and would
      sometimes returns bytes and sometimes characters.
      <span class="Li">&quot;sv_len_utf8&quot;</span> no longer assumes that its
      argument is in UTF-8. Neither of these creates UTF-8 caches for tied or
      overloaded values or for non-PVs any more.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;sv_mortalcopy&quot;</span> now copies string
      buffers of shared hash key scalars when called from XS modules [perl
      #79824].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;RXf_SPLIT&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;RXf_SKIPWHITE&quot;</span> are no longer used. They
      are now #defined as 0.</li>
  <li>The new <span class="Li">&quot;RXf_MODIFIES_VARS&quot;</span> flag can be
      set by custom regular expression engines to indicate that the execution of
      the regular expression may cause variables to be modified. This lets
      <span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span> know to skip certain
      optimisations. Perl's own regular expression engine sets this flag for the
      special backtracking verbs that set <span class="Li">$REGMARK</span> and
      <span class="Li">$REGERROR</span>.</li>
  <li>The APIs for accessing lexical pads have changed considerably.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;PADLIST&quot;</span>s are now longer
        <span class="Li">&quot;AV&quot;</span>s, but their own type instead.
        <span class="Li">&quot;PADLIST&quot;</span>s now contain a
        <span class="Li">&quot;PAD&quot;</span> and a
        <span class="Li">&quot;PADNAMELIST&quot;</span> of
        <span class="Li">&quot;PADNAME&quot;</span>s, rather than
        <span class="Li">&quot;AV&quot;</span>s for the pad and the list of pad
        names. <span class="Li">&quot;PAD&quot;</span>s,
        <span class="Li">&quot;PADNAMELIST&quot;</span>s, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;PADNAME&quot;</span>s are to be accessed as such
        through the newly added pad API instead of the plain
        <span class="Li">&quot;AV&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;SV&quot;</span> APIs. See perlapi for
      details.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In the regex API, the numbered capture callbacks are passed an index
      indicating what match variable is being accessed. There are special index
      values for the <span class="Li">&quot;$`, $&amp;, $&amp;&quot;</span>
      variables. Previously the same three values were used to retrieve
      <span class="Li">&quot;${^PREMATCH}, ${^MATCH}, ${^POSTMATCH}&quot;</span>
      too, but these have now been assigned three separate values. See
      &quot;Numbered capture callbacks&quot; in perlreapi.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;PL_sawampersand&quot;</span> was previously a
      boolean indicating that any of <span class="Li">&quot;$`, $&amp;,
      $&amp;&quot;</span> had been seen; it now contains three one-bit flags
      indicating the presence of each of the variables individually.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;CV *&quot;</span> typemap entry now supports
      <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;{}&quot;</span> overloading and typeglobs,
      just like <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;{...}&quot;</span> [perl
    #96872].</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;SVf_AMAGIC&quot;</span> flag to indicate
      overloading is now on the stash, not the object. It is now set
      automatically whenever a method or <span class="Li">@ISA</span> changes,
      so its meaning has changed, too. It now means &quot;potentially
      overloaded&quot;. When the overload table is calculated, the flag is
      automatically turned off if there is no overloading, so there should be no
      noticeable slowdown.
    <p class="Pp">The staleness of the overload tables is now checked when
        overload methods are invoked, rather than during
        <span class="Li">&quot;bless&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">&quot;A&quot; magic is gone. The changes to the handling of
        the <span class="Li">&quot;SVf_AMAGIC&quot;</span> flag eliminate the
        need for it.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;PL_amagic_generation&quot;</span> has
        been removed as no longer necessary. For XS modules, it is now a macro
        alias to <span class="Li">&quot;PL_na&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The fallback overload setting is now stored in a stash entry
        separate from overloadedness itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The character-processing code has been cleaned up in places. The changes
      should be operationally invisible.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;study&quot;</span> function was made a no-op in
      v5.16. It was simply disabled via a
      <span class="Li">&quot;return&quot;</span> statement; the code was left in
      place. Now the code supporting what
      <span class="Li">&quot;study&quot;</span> used to do has been
    removed.</li>
  <li>Under threaded perls, there is no longer a separate PV allocated for every
      COP to store its package name
      (<span class="Li">&quot;cop-&gt;stashpv&quot;</span>). Instead, there is
      an offset (<span class="Li">&quot;cop-&gt;stashoff&quot;</span>) into the
      new <span class="Li">&quot;PL_stashpad&quot;</span> array, which holds
      stash pointers.</li>
  <li>In the pluggable regex API, the
      <span class="Li">&quot;regexp_engine&quot;</span> struct has acquired a
      new field <span class="Li">&quot;op_comp&quot;</span>, which is currently
      just for perl's internal use, and should be initialized to NULL by other
      regex plugin modules.</li>
  <li>A new function <span class="Li">&quot;alloccopstash&quot;</span> has been
      added to the API, but is considered experimental. See perlapi.</li>
  <li>Perl used to implement get magic in a way that would sometimes hide bugs
      in code that could call <i>mg_get()</i> too many times on magical values.
      This hiding of errors no longer occurs, so long-standing bugs may become
      visible now. If you see magic-related errors in XS code, check to make
      sure it, together with the Perl API functions it uses, calls
      <i>mg_get()</i> only once on <i>SvGMAGICAL()</i> values.</li>
  <li>OP allocation for CVs now uses a slab allocator. This simplifies memory
      management for OPs allocated to a CV, so cleaning up after a compilation
      error is simpler and safer [perl #111462][perl #112312].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;PERL_DEBUG_READONLY_OPS&quot;</span> has been
      rewritten to work with the new slab allocator, allowing it to catch more
      violations than before.</li>
  <li>The old slab allocator for ops, which was only enabled for
      <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_IMPLICIT_SYS&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_DEBUG_READONLY_OPS&quot;</span>, has been
      retired.</li>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Here document terminators no longer require a terminating newline
      character when they occur at the end of a file. This was already the case
      at the end of a string eval [perl #65838].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT&quot;</span> builds now free
      the global struct <b>after</b> they've finished using it.</li>
  <li>A trailing '/' on a path in <span class="Li">@INC</span> will no longer
      have an additional '/' appended.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;:crlf&quot;</span> layer now works when unread
      data doesn't fit into its own buffer. [perl #112244].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;ungetc()&quot;</span> now handles UTF-8 encoded
      data. [perl #116322].</li>
  <li>A bug in the core typemap caused any C types that map to the T_BOOL core
      typemap entry to not be set, updated, or modified when the T_BOOL variable
      was used in an OUTPUT: section with an exception for RETVAL. T_BOOL in an
      INPUT: section was not affected. Using a T_BOOL return type for an XSUB
      (RETVAL) was not affected. A side effect of fixing this bug is, if a
      T_BOOL is specified in the OUTPUT: section (which previous did nothing to
      the SV), and a read only SV (literal) is passed to the XSUB, croaks like
      &quot;Modification of a read-only value attempted&quot; will happen. [perl
      #115796]</li>
  <li>On many platforms, providing a directory name as the script name caused
      perl to do nothing and report success. It should now universally report an
      error and exit nonzero. [perl #61362]</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;sort {undef} ...&quot;</span> under fatal warnings
      no longer crashes. It had begun crashing in Perl v5.16.</li>
  <li>Stashes blessed into each other (<span class="Li">&quot;bless \%Foo::,
      'Bar'; bless \%Bar::, 'Foo'&quot;</span>) no longer result in double
      frees. This bug started happening in Perl v5.16.</li>
  <li>Numerous memory leaks have been fixed, mostly involving fatal warnings and
      syntax errors.</li>
  <li>Some failed regular expression matches such as <span class="Li">&quot;'f'
      =~ /../g&quot;</span> were not resetting
      <span class="Li">&quot;pos&quot;</span>. Also, &quot;match-once&quot;
      patterns (<span class="Li">&quot;m?...?g&quot;</span>) failed to reset it,
      too, when invoked a second time [perl #23180].</li>
  <li>Several bugs involving <span class="Li">&quot;local *ISA&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;local *Foo::&quot;</span> causing stale MRO caches
      have been fixed.</li>
  <li>Defining a subroutine when its typeglob has been aliased no longer results
      in stale method caches. This bug was introduced in Perl v5.10.</li>
  <li>Localising a typeglob containing a subroutine when the typeglob's package
      has been deleted from its parent stash no longer produces an error. This
      bug was introduced in Perl v5.14.</li>
  <li>Under some circumstances, <span class="Li">&quot;local
      *method=...&quot;</span> would fail to reset method caches upon scope
      exit.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;/[.foo.]/&quot;</span> is no longer an error, but
      produces a warning (as before) and is treated as
      <span class="Li">&quot;/[.fo]/&quot;</span> [perl #115818].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;goto $tied_var&quot;</span> now calls FETCH before
      deciding what type of goto (subroutine or label) this is.</li>
  <li>Renaming packages through glob assignment (<span class="Li">&quot;*Foo:: =
      *Bar::; *Bar:: = *Baz::&quot;</span>) in combination with
      <span class="Li">&quot;m?...?&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;reset&quot;</span> no longer makes threaded builds
      crash.</li>
  <li>A number of bugs related to assigning a list to hash have been fixed. Many
      of these involve lists with repeated keys like <span class="Li">&quot;(1,
      1, 1, 1)&quot;</span>.</li>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The expression <span class="Li">&quot;scalar(%h = (1, 1, 1,
      1))&quot;</span> now returns <span class="Li">4</span>, not
      <span class="Li">2</span>.</li>
  <li>The return value of <span class="Li">&quot;%h = (1, 1, 1)&quot;</span> in
      list context was wrong. Previously this would return
      <span class="Li">&quot;(1, undef, 1)&quot;</span>, now it returns
      <span class="Li">&quot;(1, undef)&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Perl now issues the same warning on <span class="Li">&quot;($s, %h) = (1,

      ({})&quot;</span>, &quot;Reference found where even-sized list
      expected&quot;.</li>
  <li>A number of additional edge cases in list assignment to hashes were

      a term is expected. [perl #105924]</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;require a::b . 1&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;require a::b + 1&quot;</span> no longer produce

  <li>Freeing a tied hash during iteration no longer results in a memory
    leak.</li>
  <li>List assignment to a tied array or hash that dies on STORE no longer
      results in a memory leak.</li>
  <li>If the hint hash (<span class="Li">&quot;%^H&quot;</span>) is tied,
      compile-time scope entry (which copies the hint hash) no longer leaks

  <li>Constant folding no longer inappropriately triggers the special
      <span class="Li">&quot;split &quot; &quot;&quot;</span> behaviour. [perl

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;defined scalar(@array)&quot;</span>,

  <li>Running a custom debugging that defines no <span class="Li">*DB::DB</span>
      glob or provides a subroutine stub for <span class="Li">&amp;DB::DB</span>
      no longer results in a crash, but an error instead. [perl #114990]</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;reset &quot;&quot;&quot;</span> now matches its
      documentation. <span class="Li">&quot;reset&quot;</span> only resets
      <span class="Li">&quot;m?...?&quot;</span> patterns when called with no
      argument. An empty string for an argument now does nothing. (It used to be
      treated as no argument.) [perl #97958]</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span> with an argument returning an
      empty list no longer reads past the end of the stack, resulting in erratic
      behaviour. [perl #77094]</li>

      <span class="Li">&quot;pos&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;substr&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span> could be confused by ties,
      overloading, references and typeglobs if the stringification of such
      changed the internal representation to or from UTF-8. [perl #114410]</li>
  <li>utf8::encode now calls FETCH and STORE on tied variables. utf8::decode now
      calls STORE (it was already calling FETCH).</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;$tied =~ s/$non_utf8/$utf8/&quot;</span> no longer
      loops infinitely if the tied variable returns a Latin-1 string, shared

      IO slot, it used to crash. [perl #115206]</li>
  <li>Line numbers at the end of a string eval are no longer off by one. [perl

  <li>The use of <span class="Li">&quot;PL_stashcache&quot;</span>, the stash
      name lookup cache for method calls, has been restored,
    <p class="Pp">Commit da6b625f78f5f133 in August 2011 inadvertently broke the
        code that looks up values in
        <span class="Li">&quot;PL_stashcache&quot;</span>. As it's a only cache,
        quite correctly everything carried on working without it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The error &quot;Can't localize through a reference&quot; had disappeared
      in v5.16.0 when <span class="Li">&quot;local %$ref&quot;</span> appeared
      on the last line of an lvalue subroutine. This error disappeared for
      <span class="Li">&quot;\local %$ref&quot;</span> in perl v5.8.1. It has
      now been restored.</li>
  <li>The parsing of here-docs has been improved significantly, fixing several
      parsing bugs and crashes and one memory leak, and correcting wrong
      subsequent line numbers under certain conditions.</li>
  <li>Inside an eval, the error message for an unterminated here-doc no longer
      has a newline in the middle of it [perl #70836].</li>
  <li>A substitution inside a substitution pattern
      (<span class="Li">&quot;s/${s|||}//&quot;</span>) no longer confuses the
      parser.</li>
  <li>It may be an odd place to allow comments, but
      <span class="Li">&quot;s//&quot;&quot; # hello/e&quot;</span> has always
      worked, <i>unless</i> there happens to be a null character before the
      first #. Now it works even in the presence of nulls.</li>
  <li>An invalid range in <span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;y///&quot;</span> no longer results in a memory
      leak.</li>
  <li>String eval no longer treats a semicolon-delimited quote-like operator at
      the very end (<span class="Li">&quot;eval 'q;;'&quot;</span>) as a syntax
      error.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;warn {$_ =&gt; 1} + 1&quot;</span> is no longer a
      syntax error. The parser used to get confused with certain list operators
      followed by an anonymous hash and then an infix operator that shares its
      form with a unary operator.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;(caller $n)[6]&quot;</span> (which gives the text
      of the eval) used to return the actual parser buffer. Modifying it could
      result in crashes. Now it always returns a copy. The string returned no
      longer has &quot;\n;&quot; tacked on to the end. The returned text also
      includes here-doc bodies, which used to be omitted.</li>
  <li>The UTF-8 position cache is now reset when accessing magical variables, to
      avoid the string buffer and the UTF-8 position cache getting out of sync
      [perl #114410].</li>
  <li>Various cases of get magic being called twice for magical UTF-8 strings

  <li>It used to be possible for formats defined in subroutines that have
      subsequently been undefined and redefined to close over variables in the
      wrong pad (the newly-defined enclosing sub), resulting in crashes or
      &quot;Bizarre copy&quot; errors.</li>
  <li>Redefinition of XSUBs at run time could produce warnings with the wrong
      line number.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">%vd</span> sprintf format does not support version
      objects for alpha versions. It used to output the format itself (%vd) when
      passed an alpha version, and also emit an &quot;Invalid conversion in
      printf&quot; warning. It no longer does, but produces the empty string in
      the output. It also no longer leaks memory in this case.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;$obj-&gt;SUPER::method&quot;</span> calls in the

      other means.</li>
  <li>Stash aliasing (<span class="Li">&quot;*foo:: = *bar::&quot;</span>) no

  <li>Method calls on packages whose names end in ::SUPER are no longer treated
      as SUPER method calls, resulting in failure to find the method.
      Furthermore, defining subroutines in such packages no longer causes them
      to be found by SUPER method calls on the containing package [perl
      #114924].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span> now matches the code points U+200C
      (ZERO WIDTH NON-JOINER) and U+200D (ZERO WIDTH JOINER).
      <span class="Li">&quot;\W&quot;</span> no longer matches these. This
      change is because Unicode corrected their definition of what
      <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span> should match.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;dump LABEL&quot;</span> no longer leaks its
    label.</li>
  <li>Constant folding no longer changes the behaviour of functions like
      <span class="Li">&quot;stat()&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;truncate()&quot;</span> that can take either
      filenames or handles. <span class="Li">&quot;stat 1 ? foo :
      bar&quot;</span> nows treats its argument as a file name (since it is an
      arbitrary expression), rather than the handle &quot;foo&quot;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;truncate FOO, $len&quot;</span> no longer falls
      back to treating &quot;FOO&quot; as a file name if the filehandle has been
      deleted. This was broken in Perl v5.16.0.</li>
  <li>Subroutine redefinitions after sub-to-glob and glob-to-glob assignments no
      longer cause double frees or panic messages.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span> now turns vstrings into plain
      strings when performing a substitution, even if the resulting string is
      the same (<span class="Li">&quot;s/a/a/&quot;</span>).</li>
  <li>Prototype mismatch warnings no longer erroneously treat constant subs as
      having no prototype when they actually have &quot;&quot;.</li>
  <li>Constant subroutines and forward declarations no longer prevent prototype
      mismatch warnings from omitting the sub name.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> on a subroutine now clears call
      checkers.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;ref&quot;</span> operator started leaking
      memory on blessed objects in Perl v5.16.0. This has been fixed [perl
      #114340].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> no longer tries to parse its
      arguments as a statement, making <span class="Li">&quot;use constant { ()
      };&quot;</span> a syntax error [perl #114222].</li>
  <li>On debugging builds, &quot;uninitialized&quot; warnings inside formats no
      longer cause assertion failures.</li>
  <li>On debugging builds, subroutines nested inside formats no longer cause
      assertion failures [perl #78550].</li>
  <li>Formats and <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> statements are now
      permitted inside formats.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;print $x&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;sub { print $x }-&gt;()&quot;</span> now always
      produce the same output. It was possible for the latter to refuse to close
      over <span class="Li">$x</span> if the variable was not active; e.g., if
      it was defined outside a currently-running named subroutine.</li>
  <li>Similarly, <span class="Li">&quot;print $x&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;print eval '$x'&quot;</span> now produce the same
      output. This also allows &quot;my <span class="Li">$x</span> if 0&quot;
      variables to be seen in the debugger [perl #114018].</li>
  <li>Formats called recursively no longer stomp on their own lexical variables,
      but each recursive call has its own set of lexicals.</li>
  <li>Attempting to free an active format or the handle associated with it no
      longer results in a crash.</li>
  <li>Format parsing no longer gets confused by braces, semicolons and
      low-precedence operators. It used to be possible to use braces as format
      delimiters (instead of <span class="Li">&quot;=&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>), but only sometimes. Semicolons and
      low-precedence operators in format argument lines no longer confuse the
      parser into ignoring the line's return value. In format argument lines,
      braces can now be used for anonymous hashes, instead of being treated
      always as <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span> blocks.</li>
  <li>Formats can now be nested inside code blocks in regular expressions and
      other quoted constructs (<span class="Li">&quot;/(?{...})/&quot;</span>
      and <span class="Li">&quot;qq/${...}/&quot;</span>) [perl #114040].</li>
  <li>Formats are no longer created after compilation errors.</li>
  <li>Under debugging builds, the <b>-DA</b> command line option started
      crashing in Perl v5.16.0. It has been fixed [perl #114368].</li>
  <li>A potential deadlock scenario involving the premature termination of a
      pseudo- forked child in a Windows build with ithreads enabled has been
      fixed. This resolves the common problem of the <i>t/op/fork.t</i> test
      hanging on Windows [perl #88840].</li>
  <li>The code which generates errors from
      <span class="Li">&quot;require()&quot;</span> could potentially read one
      or two bytes before the start of the filename for filenames less than
      three bytes long and ending <span class="Li">&quot;/\.p?\z/&quot;</span>.
      This has now been fixed. Note that it could never have happened with
      module names given to <span class="Li">&quot;use()&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;require()&quot;</span> anyway.</li>
  <li>The handling of pathnames of modules given to
      <span class="Li">&quot;require()&quot;</span> has been made thread-safe on
      VMS.</li>
  <li>Non-blocking sockets have been fixed on VMS.</li>
  <li>Pod can now be nested in code inside a quoted construct outside of a
      string eval. This used to work only within string evals [perl
    #114040].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;goto ''&quot;</span> now looks for an empty label,
      producing the &quot;goto must have label&quot; error message, instead of
      exiting the program [perl #111794].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;goto &quot;\0&quot;&quot;</span> now dies with
      &quot;Can't find label&quot; instead of &quot;goto must have
    label&quot;.</li>
  <li>The C function <span class="Li">&quot;hv_store&quot;</span> used to result
      in crashes when used on <span class="Li">&quot;%^H&quot;</span> [perl
      #111000].</li>
  <li>A call checker attached to a closure prototype via
      <span class="Li">&quot;cv_set_call_checker&quot;</span> is now copied to
      closures cloned from it. So
      <span class="Li">&quot;cv_set_call_checker&quot;</span> now works inside
      an attribute handler for a closure.</li>
  <li>Writing to <span class="Li">$^N</span> used to have no effect. Now it
      croaks with &quot;Modification of a read-only value&quot; by default, but
      that can be overridden by a custom regular expression engine, as with
      <span class="Li">$1</span> [perl #112184].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> on a control character glob
      (<span class="Li">&quot;undef *^H&quot;</span>) no longer emits an
      erroneous warning about ambiguity [perl #112456].</li>
  <li>For efficiency's sake, many operators and built-in functions return the
      same scalar each time. Lvalue subroutines and subroutines in the CORE::
      namespace were allowing this implementation detail to leak through.
      <span class="Li">&quot;print &amp;CORE::uc(&quot;a&quot;),
      &amp;CORE::uc(&quot;b&quot;)&quot;</span> used to print &quot;BB&quot;.
      The same thing would happen with an lvalue subroutine returning the return
      value of <span class="Li">&quot;uc&quot;</span>. Now the value is copied
      in such cases.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;method {}&quot;</span> syntax with an empty block
      or a block returning an empty list used to crash or use some random value
      left on the stack as its invocant. Now it produces an error.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;vec&quot;</span> now works with extremely large
      offsets (&gt;2 GB) [perl #111730].</li>
  <li>Changes to overload settings now take effect immediately, as do changes to
      inheritance that affect overloading. They used to take effect only after
      <span class="Li">&quot;bless&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Objects that were created before a class had any overloading
        used to remain non-overloaded even if the class gained overloading
        through <span class="Li">&quot;use overload&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">@ISA</span> changes, and even after
        <span class="Li">&quot;bless&quot;</span>. This has been fixed [perl
        #112708].</p>
  </li>
  <li>Classes with overloading can now inherit fallback values.</li>
  <li>Overloading was not respecting a fallback value of 0 if there were
      overloaded objects on both sides of an assignment operator like
      <span class="Li">&quot;+=&quot;</span> [perl #111856].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;pos&quot;</span> now croaks with hash and array
      arguments, instead of producing erroneous warnings.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;while(each %h)&quot;</span> now implies
      <span class="Li">&quot;while(defined($_ = each %h))&quot;</span>, like
      <span class="Li">&quot;readline&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;readdir&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Subs in the CORE:: namespace no longer crash after
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef *_&quot;</span> when called with no argument
      list (<span class="Li">&amp;CORE::time</span> with no parentheses).</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span> no longer produces the
      &quot;'/' must follow a numeric type in unpack&quot; error when it is the
      data that are at fault [perl #60204].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;join&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;@array&quot;</span> now call FETCH only once on a
      tied <span class="Li">$&quot;</span> [perl #8931].</li>
  <li>Some subroutine calls generated by compiling core ops affected by a
      <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::GLOBAL&quot;</span> override had op checking
      performed twice. The checking is always idempotent for pure Perl code, but
      the double checking can matter when custom call checkers are
    involved.</li>
  <li>A race condition used to exist around fork that could cause a signal sent
      to the parent to be handled by both parent and child. Signals are now
      blocked briefly around fork to prevent this from happening [perl
    #82580].</li>
  <li>The implementation of code blocks in regular expressions, such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?{})&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;(??{})&quot;</span>, has been heavily reworked to
      eliminate a whole slew of bugs. The main user-visible changes are:</li>
</ul>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Code blocks within patterns are now parsed in the same pass as the
      surrounding code; in particular it is no longer necessary to have balanced
      braces: this now works:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    /(?{  $x='{'  })/
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This means that this error message is no longer generated:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    Sequence (?{...}) not terminated or not {}-balanced in regex
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">but a new error may be seen:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    Sequence (?{...}) not terminated with ')'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In addition, literal code blocks within run-time patterns are
        only compiled once, at perl compile-time:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    for my $p (...) {
        # this 'FOO' block of code is compiled once,
        # at the same time as the surrounding 'for' loop
        /$p{(?{FOO;})/;
    }
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Lexical variables are now sane as regards scope, recursion and closure
      behavior. In particular, <span class="Li">&quot;/A(?{B})C/&quot;</span>
      behaves (from a closure viewpoint) exactly like <span class="Li">&quot;/A/
      &amp;&amp; do { B } &amp;&amp; /C/&quot;</span>, while
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr/A(?{B})C/&quot;</span> is like
      <span class="Li">&quot;sub {/A/ &amp;&amp; do { B } &amp;&amp;
      /C/}&quot;</span>. So this code now works how you might expect, creating
      three regexes that match 0, 1, and 2:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    for my $i (0..2) {
        push @r, qr/^(??{$i})$/;
    }
    &quot;1&quot; =~ $r[1]; # matches
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;use re 'eval'&quot;</span> pragma is now only
      required for code blocks defined at runtime; in particular in the
      following, the text of the <span class="Li">$r</span> pattern is still
      interpolated into the new pattern and recompiled, but the individual
      compiled code-blocks within <span class="Li">$r</span> are reused rather
      than being recompiled, and <span class="Li">&quot;use re
      'eval'&quot;</span> isn't needed any more:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    my $r = qr/abc(?{....})def/;
    /xyz$r/;
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Flow control operators no longer crash. Each code block runs in a new
      dynamic scope, so <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span> etc. will not
      see any enclosing loops. <span class="Li">&quot;return&quot;</span>
      returns a value from the code block, not from any enclosing
    subroutine.</li>
  <li>Perl normally caches the compilation of run-time patterns, and doesn't
      recompile if the pattern hasn't changed, but this is now disabled if
      required for the correct behavior of closures. For example:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    my $code = '(??{$x})';
    for my $x (1..3) {
        # recompile to see fresh value of $x each time
        $x =~ /$code/;
    }
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;/msix&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?msix)&quot;</span> etc. flags are now propagated
      into the return value from <span class="Li">&quot;(??{})&quot;</span>;
      this now works:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    &quot;AB&quot; =~ /a(??{'b'})/i;
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Warnings and errors will appear to come from the surrounding code (or for
      run-time code blocks, from an eval) rather than from an
      <span class="Li">&quot;re_eval&quot;</span>:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    use re 'eval'; $c = '(?{ warn &quot;foo&quot; })'; /$c/;
    /(?{ warn &quot;foo&quot; })/;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">formerly gave:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    foo at (re_eval 1) line 1.
    foo at (re_eval 2) line 1.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">and now gives:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    foo at (eval 1) line 1.
    foo at /some/prog line 2.
    </pre>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent"></div>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Perl now can be recompiled to use any Unicode version. In v5.16, it worked
      on Unicodes 6.0 and 6.1, but there were various bugs if earlier releases
      were used; the older the release the more problems.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;vec&quot;</span> no longer produces
      &quot;uninitialized&quot; warnings in lvalue context [perl #9423].</li>
  <li>An optimization involving fixed strings in regular expressions could cause
      a severe performance penalty in edge cases. This has been fixed [perl
      #76546].</li>
  <li>In certain cases, including empty subpatterns within a regular expression
      (such as <span class="Li">&quot;(?:)&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?:|)&quot;</span>) could disable some
      optimizations. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>The &quot;Can't find an opnumber&quot; message that
      <span class="Li">&quot;prototype&quot;</span> produces when passed a
      string like &quot;CORE::nonexistent_keyword&quot; now passes UTF-8 and
      embedded NULs through unchanged [perl #97478].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;prototype&quot;</span> now treats magical variables
      like <span class="Li">$1</span> the same way as non-magical variables when
      checking for the CORE:: prefix, instead of treating them as subroutine
      names.</li>
  <li>Under threaded perls, a runtime code block in a regular expression could
      corrupt the package name stored in the op tree, resulting in bad reads in
      <span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span>, and possibly crashes [perl
      #113060].</li>
  <li>Referencing a closure prototype
      (<span class="Li">&quot;\&amp;{$_[1]}&quot;</span> in an attribute handler
      for a closure) no longer results in a copy of the subroutine (or assertion
      failures on debugging builds).</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;eval '__PACKAGE__'&quot;</span> now returns the
      right answer on threaded builds if the current package has been assigned
      over (as in <span class="Li">&quot;*ThisPackage:: =
      *ThatPackage::&quot;</span>) [perl #78742].</li>
  <li>If a package is deleted by code that it calls, it is possible for
      <span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span> to see a stack frame belonging
      to that deleted package. <span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span> could
      crash if the stash's memory address was reused for a scalar and a
      substitution was performed on the same scalar [perl #113486].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;UNIVERSAL::can&quot;</span> no longer treats its
      first argument differently depending on whether it is a string or number
      internally.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> with
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&amp;&quot;</span> for the mode checks to see
      whether the third argument is a number, in determining whether to treat it
      as a file descriptor or a handle name. Magical variables like
      <span class="Li">$1</span> were always failing the numeric check and being
      treated as handle names.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;warn&quot;</span>'s handling of magical variables
      (<span class="Li">$1</span>, ties) has undergone several fixes.
      <span class="Li">&quot;FETCH&quot;</span> is only called once now on a
      tied argument or a tied <span class="Li">$@</span> [perl #97480]. Tied
      variables returning objects that stringify as &quot;&quot; are no longer
      ignored. A tied <span class="Li">$@</span> that happened to return a
      reference the <i>previous</i> time it was used is no longer ignored.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;warn &quot;&quot;&quot;</span> now treats
      <span class="Li">$@</span> with a number in it the same way, regardless of
      whether it happened via <span class="Li">&quot;$@=3&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;$@=&quot;3&quot;&quot;</span>. It used to ignore
      the former. Now it appends &quot;\t...caught&quot;, as it has always done
      with <span class="Li">&quot;$@=&quot;3&quot;&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Numeric operators on magical variables (e.g.,
      <span class="Li">&quot;$1&#x00A0;+&#x00A0;1&quot;</span>) used to use
      floating point operations even where integer operations were more
      appropriate, resulting in loss of accuracy on 64-bit platforms [perl
      #109542].</li>
  <li>Unary negation no longer treats a string as a number if the string
      happened to be used as a number at some point. So, if
      <span class="Li">$x</span> contains the string &quot;dogs&quot;,
      <span class="Li">&quot;-$x&quot;</span> returns &quot;-dogs&quot; even if
      <span class="Li">&quot;$y=0+$x&quot;</span> has happened at some
    point.</li>
  <li>In Perl v5.14, <span class="Li">&quot;-'-10'&quot;</span> was fixed to
      return &quot;10&quot;, not &quot;+10&quot;. But magical variables
      (<span class="Li">$1</span>, ties) were not fixed till now [perl
    #57706].</li>
  <li>Unary negation now treats strings consistently, regardless of the internal
      <span class="Li">&quot;UTF8&quot;</span> flag.</li>
  <li>A regression introduced in Perl v5.16.0 involving
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr/</span><i>SEARCHLIST</i><span class="Li">/</span><i>REPLACEMENTLIST</i><span class="Li">/&quot;</span>
      has been fixed. Only the first instance is supposed to be meaningful if a
      character appears more than once in
      <span class="Li">&quot;</span><i>SEARCHLIST</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>.
      Under some circumstances, the final instance was overriding all earlier
      ones. [perl #113584]</li>
  <li>Regular expressions like <span class="Li">&quot;qr/\87/&quot;</span>
      previously silently inserted a NUL character, thus matching as if it had
      been written <span class="Li">&quot;qr/\00087/&quot;</span>. Now it
      matches as if it had been written as
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr/87/&quot;</span>, with a message that the
      sequence <span class="Li">&quot;\8&quot;</span> is unrecognized.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;__SUB__&quot;</span> now works in special blocks
      (<span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;END&quot;</span>, etc.).</li>
  <li>Thread creation on Windows could theoretically result in a crash if done
      inside a <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span> block. It still does
      not work properly, but it no longer crashes [perl #111610].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;\&amp;{''}&quot;</span> (with the empty string) now
      autovivifies a stub like any other sub name, and no longer produces the
      &quot;Unable to create sub&quot; error [perl #94476].</li>
  <li>A regression introduced in v5.14.0 has been fixed, in which some calls to
      the <span class="Li">&quot;re&quot;</span> module would clobber
      <span class="Li">$_</span> [perl #113750].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;do FILE&quot;</span> now always either sets or
      clears <span class="Li">$@</span>, even when the file can't be read. This
      ensures that testing <span class="Li">$@</span> first (as recommended by
      the documentation) always returns the correct result.</li>
  <li>The array iterator used for the <span class="Li">&quot;each
      @array&quot;</span> construct is now correctly reset when
      <span class="Li">@array</span> is cleared [perl #75596]. This happens, for
      example, when the array is globally assigned to, as in
      <span class="Li">&quot;@array = (...)&quot;</span>, but not when its
      <b>values</b> are assigned to. In terms of the XS API, it means that
      <span class="Li">&quot;av_clear()&quot;</span> will now reset the
      iterator.
    <p class="Pp">This mirrors the behaviour of the hash iterator when the hash
        is cleared.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;$class-&gt;can&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;$class-&gt;isa&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;$class-&gt;DOES&quot;</span> now return correct
      results, regardless of whether that package referred to by
      <span class="Li">$class</span> exists [perl #47113].</li>
  <li>Arriving signals no longer clear <span class="Li">$@</span> [perl
    #45173].</li>
  <li>Allow <span class="Li">&quot;my ()&quot;</span> declarations with an empty
      variable list [perl #113554].</li>
  <li>During parsing, subs declared after errors no longer leave stubs [perl
      #113712].</li>
  <li>Closures containing no string evals no longer hang on to their containing
      subroutines, allowing variables closed over by outer subroutines to be
      freed when the outer sub is freed, even if the inner sub still exists
      [perl #89544].</li>
  <li>Duplication of in-memory filehandles by opening with a
      &quot;&lt;&amp;=&quot; or &quot;&gt;&amp;=&quot; mode stopped working
      properly in v5.16.0. It was causing the new handle to reference a
      different scalar variable. This has been fixed [perl #113764].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span> expressions no longer crash with
      custom regular expression engines that do not set
      <span class="Li">&quot;offs&quot;</span> at regular expression compilation
      time [perl #112962].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;delete local&quot;</span> no longer crashes with
      certain magical arrays and hashes [perl #112966].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;local&quot;</span> on elements of certain magical
      arrays and hashes used not to arrange to have the element deleted on scope
      exit, even if the element did not exist before
      <span class="Li">&quot;local&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;scalar(write)&quot;</span> no longer returns
      multiple items [perl #73690].</li>
  <li>String to floating point conversions no longer misparse certain strings
      under <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> [perl #109318].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">@INC</span> filters that die no longer leak memory [perl
      #92252].</li>
  <li>The implementations of overloaded operations are now called in the correct
      context. This allows, among other things, being able to properly override
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> [perl #47119].</li>
  <li>Specifying only the <span class="Li">&quot;fallback&quot;</span> key when
      calling <span class="Li">&quot;use overload&quot;</span> now behaves
      properly [perl #113010].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;sub foo { my $a = 0; while ($a) { ... }
      }&quot;</span> and <span class="Li">&quot;sub foo { while (0) { ... }
      }&quot;</span> now return the same thing [perl #73618].</li>
  <li>String negation now behaves the same under <span class="Li">&quot;use
      integer;&quot;</span> as it does without [perl #113012].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;chr&quot;</span> now returns the Unicode
      replacement character (U+FFFD) for -1, regardless of the internal
      representation. -1 used to wrap if the argument was tied or a string
      internally.</li>
  <li>Using a <span class="Li">&quot;format&quot;</span> after its enclosing sub
      was freed could crash as of perl v5.12.0, if the format referenced lexical
      variables from the outer sub.</li>
  <li>Using a <span class="Li">&quot;format&quot;</span> after its enclosing sub
      was undefined could crash as of perl v5.10.0, if the format referenced
      lexical variables from the outer sub.</li>
  <li>Using a <span class="Li">&quot;format&quot;</span> defined inside a
      closure, which format references lexical variables from outside, never
      really worked unless the <span class="Li">&quot;write&quot;</span> call
      was directly inside the closure. In v5.10.0 it even started crashing. Now
      the copy of that closure nearest the top of the call stack is used to find
      those variables.</li>
  <li>Formats that close over variables in special blocks no longer crash if a
      stub exists with the same name as the special block before the special
      block is compiled.</li>
  <li>The parser no longer gets confused, treating <span class="Li">&quot;eval
      foo ()&quot;</span> as a syntax error if preceded by
      <span class="Li">&quot;print;&quot;</span> [perl #16249].</li>
  <li>The return value of <span class="Li">&quot;syscall&quot;</span> is no
      longer truncated on 64-bit platforms [perl #113980].</li>
  <li>Constant folding no longer causes <span class="Li">&quot;print 1 ? FOO :
      BAR&quot;</span> to print to the FOO handle [perl #78064].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;do subname&quot;</span> now calls the named
      subroutine and uses the file name it returns, instead of opening a file
      named &quot;subname&quot;.</li>
  <li>Subroutines looked up by rv2cv check hooks (registered by XS modules) are
      now taken into consideration when determining whether
      <span class="Li">&quot;foo bar&quot;</span> should be the sub call
      <span class="Li">&quot;foo(bar)&quot;</span> or the method call
      <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;bar&quot;-&gt;foo&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;CORE::foo::bar&quot;</span> is no longer treated
      specially, allowing global overrides to be called directly via
      <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::GLOBAL::uc(...)&quot;</span> [perl
    #113016].</li>
  <li>Calling an undefined sub whose typeglob has been undefined now produces
      the customary &quot;Undefined subroutine called&quot; error, instead of
      &quot;Not a CODE reference&quot;.</li>
  <li>Two bugs involving <span class="Li">@ISA</span> have been fixed.
      <span class="Li">&quot;*ISA = *glob_without_array&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef *ISA; @{*ISA}&quot;</span> would prevent
      future modifications to <span class="Li">@ISA</span> from updating the
      internal caches used to look up methods. The *glob_without_array case was
      a regression from Perl v5.12.</li>
  <li>Regular expression optimisations sometimes caused
      <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> with
      <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> to produce failed or incorrect
      matches [perl #114068].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;__SUB__&quot;</span> now works in a
      <span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span> block when the enclosing
      subroutine is predeclared with <span class="Li">&quot;sub
      foo;&quot;</span> syntax [perl #113710].</li>
  <li>Unicode properties only apply to Unicode code points, which leads to some
      subtleties when regular expressions are matched against above-Unicode code
      points. There is a warning generated to draw your attention to this.
      However, this warning was being generated inappropriately in some cases,
      such as when a program was being parsed. Non-Unicode matches such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;[:word:]&quot;</span> should not generate the
      warning, as their definitions don't limit them to apply to only Unicode
      code points. Now the message is only generated when matching against
      <span class="Li">&quot;\p{}&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;\P{}&quot;</span>. There remains a bug, [perl
      #114148], for the very few properties in Unicode that match just a single
      code point. The warning is not generated if they are matched against an
      above-Unicode code point.</li>
  <li>Uninitialized warnings mentioning hash elements would only mention the
      element name if it was not in the first bucket of the hash, due to an
      off-by-one error.</li>
  <li>A regular expression optimizer bug could cause multiline &quot;^&quot; to
      behave incorrectly in the presence of line breaks, such that
      <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;/\n\n&quot; =~ m#\A(?:^/$)#im&quot;</span>
      would not match [perl #115242].</li>
  <li>Failed <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span> in list context no longer
      corrupts the stack. <span class="Li">&quot;@a = (1, 2, fork,
      3)&quot;</span> used to gobble up the 2 and assign
      <span class="Li">&quot;(1, undef, 3)&quot;</span> if the
      <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span> call failed.</li>
  <li>Numerous memory leaks have been fixed, mostly involving tied variables
      that die, regular expression character classes and code blocks, and syntax
      errors.</li>
  <li>Assigning a regular expression
      (<span class="Li">&quot;${qr//}&quot;</span>) to a variable that happens
      to hold a floating point number no longer causes assertion failures on
      debugging builds.</li>
  <li>Assigning a regular expression to a scalar containing a number no longer
      causes subsequent numification to produce random numbers.</li>
  <li>Assigning a regular expression to a magic variable no longer wipes away
      the magic. This was a regression from v5.10.</li>
  <li>Assigning a regular expression to a blessed scalar no longer results in
      crashes. This was also a regression from v5.10.</li>
  <li>Regular expression can now be assigned to tied hash and array elements
      with flattening into strings.</li>
  <li>Numifying a regular expression no longer results in an uninitialized
      warning.</li>
  <li>Negative array indices no longer cause EXISTS methods of tied variables to
      be ignored. This was a regression from v5.12.</li>
  <li>Negative array indices no longer result in crashes on arrays tied to
      non-objects.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;$byte_overload .= $utf8&quot;</span> no longer
      results in doubly-encoded UTF-8 if the left-hand scalar happened to have
      produced a UTF-8 string the last time overloading was invoked.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;goto &amp;sub&quot;</span> now uses the current
      value of <span class="Li">@_</span>, instead of using the array the
      subroutine was originally called with. This means
      <span class="Li">&quot;local @_ = (...); goto &amp;sub&quot;</span> now
      works [perl #43077].</li>
  <li>If a debugger is invoked recursively, it no longer stomps on its own
      lexical variables. Formerly under recursion all calls would share the same
      set of lexical variables [perl #115742].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">*_{ARRAY}</span> returned from a subroutine no longer
      spontaneously becomes empty.</li>
  <li>When using <span class="Li">&quot;say&quot;</span> to print to a tied
      filehandle, the value of <span class="Li">&quot;$\&quot;</span> is
      correctly localized, even if it was previously undef. [perl #119927]</li>

    database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
    http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
    a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
