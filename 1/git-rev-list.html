<p class="Pp">List commits that are reachable by following the <b>parent</b>
    links from the given commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable from
    the one(s) given with a <i>^</i> in front of them. The output is given in
    reverse chronological order by default.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can think of this as a set operation. Commits reachable from
    any of the commits given on the command line form a set, and then commits
    reachable from any of the ones given with <i>^</i> in front are subtracted
    from that set. The remaining commits are what comes out in the
    command&#x2019;s output. Various other options and paths parameters can be
    used to further limit the result.</p>
<p class="Pp">Thus, the following command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git rev-list foo bar ^baz
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">means &quot;list all the commits which are reachable from
    <i>foo</i> or <i>bar</i>, but not from <i>baz</i>&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">A special notation
    &quot;<i>&lt;commit1&gt;</i>..<i>&lt;commit2&gt;</i>&quot; can be used as a
    short-hand for &quot;^<i>&lt;commit1&gt;</i> <i>&lt;commit2&gt;</i>&quot;.
    For example, either of the following may be used interchangeably:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git rev-list origin..HEAD
$ git rev-list HEAD ^origin
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Another special notation is
    &quot;<i>&lt;commit1&gt;</i>...<i>&lt;commit2&gt;</i>&quot; which is useful
    for merges. The resulting set of commits is the symmetric difference between
    the two operands. The following two commands are equivalent:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git rev-list A B --not $(git merge-base --all A B)
$ git rev-list A...B
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"><i>rev-list</i> is a very essential Git command, since it provides
    the ability to build and traverse commit ancestry graphs. For this reason,
    it has a lot of different options that enables it to be used by commands as
    different as <i>git bisect</i> and <i>git repack</i>.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Commit_Limiting"><a class="permalink" href="#Commit_Limiting">Commit
  Limiting</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using
    the special notations explained in the description, additional commit
    limiting may be applied.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using more options generally further limits the output (e.g.
    <b>--since=&lt;date1&gt;</b> limits to commits newer than
    <b>&lt;date1&gt;</b>, and using it with <b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>
    further limits to commits whose log message has a line that matches
    <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>), unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting
    options, such as <b>--reverse</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">-&lt;number&gt;, -n &lt;number&gt;, --max-count=&lt;number&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the number of commits to output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--skip=&lt;number&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Skip <i>number</i> commits before starting to show the
  commit output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--since=&lt;date&gt;, --after=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show commits more recent than a specific date.</div>
<p class="Pp">--since-as-filter=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show all commits more recent than a specific date. This
  visits all commits in the range, rather than stopping at the first commit
  which is older than a specific date.</div>
<p class="Pp">--until=&lt;date&gt;, --before=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show commits older than a specific date.</div>
<p class="Pp">--max-age=&lt;timestamp&gt;, --min-age=&lt;timestamp&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the commits output to specified time range.</div>
<p class="Pp">--author=&lt;pattern&gt;, --committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer
  header lines that match the specified pattern (regular expression). With more
  than one <b>--author=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>, commits whose author matches any of
  the given patterns are chosen (similarly for multiple
  <b>--committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>).</div>
<p class="Pp">--grep-reflog=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that
  match the specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
  <b>--grep-reflog</b>, commits whose reflog message matches any of the given
  patterns are chosen. It is an error to use this option unless
  <b>--walk-reflogs</b> is in use.</div>
<p class="Pp">--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the commits output to ones with log message that
  matches the specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
  <b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>, commits whose message matches any of the given
  patterns are chosen (but see <b>--all-match</b>).</div>
<p class="Pp">--all-match</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the commits output to ones that match all given
  <b>--grep</b>, instead of ones that match at least one.</div>
<p class="Pp">--invert-grep</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the commits output to ones with log message that do
  not match the pattern specified with <b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-i, --regexp-ignore-case</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Match the regular expression limiting patterns without
  regard to letter case.</div>
<p class="Pp">--basic-regexp</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Consider the limiting patterns to be basic regular
  expressions; this is the default.</div>
<p class="Pp">-E, --extended-regexp</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular
  expressions instead of the default basic regular expressions.</div>
<p class="Pp">-F, --fixed-strings</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings
  (don&#x2019;t interpret pattern as a regular expression).</div>
<p class="Pp">-P, --perl-regexp</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Consider the limiting patterns to be Perl-compatible
  regular expressions.
<p class="Pp">Support for these types of regular expressions is an optional
    compile-time dependency. If Git wasn&#x2019;t compiled with support for them
    providing this option will cause it to die.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--remove-empty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Stop when a given path disappears from the tree.</div>
<p class="Pp">--merges</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print only merge commits. This is exactly the same as
  <b>--min-parents=2</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-merges</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not print commits with more than one parent. This is
  exactly the same as <b>--max-parents=1</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--min-parents=&lt;number&gt;, --max-parents=&lt;number&gt;,
    --no-min-parents, --no-max-parents</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that
  many parent commits. In particular, <b>--max-parents=1</b> is the same as
  <b>--no-merges</b>, <b>--min-parents=2</b> is the same as <b>--merges</b>.
  <b>--max-parents=0</b> gives all root commits and <b>--min-parents=3</b> all
  octopus merges.
<p class="Pp"><b>--no-min-parents</b> and <b>--no-max-parents</b> reset these
    limits (to no limit) again. Equivalent forms are <b>--min-parents=0</b> (any
    commit has 0 or more parents) and <b>--max-parents=-1</b> (negative numbers
    denote no upper limit).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--first-parent</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When finding commits to include, follow only the first
  parent commit upon seeing a merge commit. This option can give a better
  overview when viewing the evolution of a particular topic branch, because
  merges into a topic branch tend to be only about adjusting to updated upstream
  from time to time, and this option allows you to ignore the individual commits
  brought in to your history by such a merge.</div>
<p class="Pp">--exclude-first-parent-only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When finding commits to exclude (with a <i>^</i>), follow
  only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit. This can be used to
  find the set of changes in a topic branch from the point where it diverged
  from the remote branch, given that arbitrary merges can be valid topic branch
  changes.</div>
<p class="Pp">--not</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Reverses the meaning of the <i>^</i> prefix (or lack
  thereof) for all following revision specifiers, up to the next
  <b>--not</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--all</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/</b>, along with
  <b>HEAD</b>, are listed on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--branches[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/heads</b> are
  listed on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i>
  is given, limit branches to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks
  <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end is implied.</div>
<p class="Pp">--tags[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/tags</b> are listed
  on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> is
  given, limit tags to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks
  <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end is implied.</div>
<p class="Pp">--remotes[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/remotes</b> are
  listed on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i>
  is given, limit remote-tracking branches to ones matching given shell glob. If
  pattern lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end is
  implied.</div>
<p class="Pp">--glob=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all the refs matching shell glob
  <i>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</i> are listed on the command line as
  <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. Leading <i>refs/</i>, is automatically prepended if
  missing. If pattern lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the
  end is implied.</div>
<p class="Pp">--exclude=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not include refs matching <i>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</i>
  that the next <b>--all</b>, <b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>,
  <b>--remotes</b>, or <b>--glob</b> would otherwise consider. Repetitions of
  this option accumulate exclusion patterns up to the next <b>--all</b>,
  <b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>, <b>--remotes</b>, or <b>--glob</b> option
  (other options or arguments do not clear accumulated patterns).
<p class="Pp">The patterns given should not begin with <b>refs/heads</b>,
    <b>refs/tags</b>, or <b>refs/remotes</b> when applied to <b>--branches</b>,
    <b>--tags</b>, or <b>--remotes</b>, respectively, and they must begin with
    <b>refs/</b> when applied to <b>--glob</b> or <b>--all</b>. If a trailing
    <i>/*</i> is intended, it must be given explicitly.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--reflog</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all objects mentioned by reflogs are listed
  on the command line as <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--alternate-refs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all objects mentioned as ref tips of
  alternate repositories were listed on the command line. An alternate
  repository is any repository whose object directory is specified in
  <b>objects/info/alternates</b>. The set of included objects may be modified by
  <b>core.alternateRefsCommand</b>, etc. See <b>git-config</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--single-worktree</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, all working trees will be examined by the
  following options when there are more than one (see <b>git-worktree</b>(1)):
  <b>--all</b>, <b>--reflog</b> and <b>--indexed-objects</b>. This option forces
  them to examine the current working tree only.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-missing</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Upon seeing an invalid object name in the input, pretend
  as if the bad input was not given.</div>
<p class="Pp">--stdin</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to the <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i> listed on the
  command line, read them from the standard input. If a <b>--</b> separator is
  seen, stop reading commits and start reading paths to limit the result.</div>
<p class="Pp">--quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Don&#x2019;t print anything to standard output. This form
  is primarily meant to allow the caller to test the exit status to see if a
  range of objects is fully connected (or not). It is faster than redirecting
  stdout to <b>/dev/null</b> as the output does not have to be formatted.</div>
<p class="Pp">--disk-usage</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Suppress normal output; instead, print the sum of the
  bytes used for on-disk storage by the selected commits or objects. This is
  equivalent to piping the output into <b>git cat-file
  --batch-check='%(objectsize:disk)'</b>, except that it runs much faster
  (especially with <b>--use-bitmap-index</b>). See the <b>CAVEATS</b> section in
  <b>git-cat-file</b>(1) for the limitations of what &quot;on-disk storage&quot;
  means.</div>
<p class="Pp">--cherry-mark</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Like <b>--cherry-pick</b> (see below) but mark equivalent
  commits with <b>=</b> rather than omitting them, and inequivalent ones with
  <b>+</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--cherry-pick</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Omit any commit that introduces the same change as
  another commit on the &#x201C;other side&#x201D; when the set of commits are
  limited with symmetric difference.
<p class="Pp">For example, if you have two branches, <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, a
    usual way to list all commits on only one side of them is with
    <b>--left-right</b> (see the example below in the description of the
    <b>--left-right</b> option). However, it shows the commits that were
    cherry-picked from the other branch (for example, &#x201C;3rd on b&#x201D;
    may be cherry-picked from branch A). With this option, such pairs of commits
    are excluded from the output.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--left-only, --right-only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric
  difference, i.e. only those which would be marked <b>&lt;</b> resp.
  <b>&gt;</b> by <b>--left-right</b>.
<p class="Pp">For example, <b>--cherry-pick --right-only A...B</b> omits those
    commits from <b>B</b> which are in <b>A</b> or are patch-equivalent to a
    commit in <b>A</b>. In other words, this lists the <b>+</b> commits from
    <b>git cherry A B</b>. More precisely, <b>--cherry-pick --right-only
    --no-merges</b> gives the exact list.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--cherry</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A synonym for <b>--right-only --cherry-mark
  --no-merges</b>; useful to limit the output to the commits on our side and
  mark those that have been applied to the other side of a forked history with
  <b>git log --cherry upstream...mybranch</b>, similar to <b>git cherry upstream
  mybranch</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-g, --walk-reflogs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog
  entries from the most recent one to older ones. When this option is used you
  cannot specify commits to exclude (that is, <i>^commit</i>,
  <i>commit1..commit2</i>, and <i>commit1...commit2</i> notations cannot be
  used).
<p class="Pp">With <b>--pretty</b> format other than <b>oneline</b> and
    <b>reference</b> (for obvious reasons), this causes the output to have two
    extra lines of information taken from the reflog. The reflog designator in
    the output may be shown as <b>ref@{Nth}</b> (where <b>Nth</b> is the
    reverse-chronological index in the reflog) or as <b>ref@{timestamp}</b>
    (with the timestamp for that entry), depending on a few rules:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.If the starting point is specified as
  <b>ref@{Nth}</b>, show the index format.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.If the starting point was specified as
  <b>ref@{now}</b>, show the timestamp format.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.If neither was used, but <b>--date</b> was given on
  the command line, show the timestamp in the format requested by
  <b>--date</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.Otherwise, show the index format.</div>
<p class="Pp">Under <b>--pretty=oneline</b>, the commit message is prefixed with
    this information on the same line. This option cannot be combined with
    <b>--reverse</b>. See also <b>git-reflog</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">Under <b>--pretty=reference</b>, this information will not be
    shown at all.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--merge</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">After a failed merge, show refs that touch files having a
  conflict and don&#x2019;t exist on all heads to merge.</div>
<p class="Pp">--boundary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output excluded boundary commits. Boundary commits are
  prefixed with <b>-</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--use-bitmap-index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Try to speed up the traversal using the pack bitmap index
  (if one is available). Note that when traversing with <b>--objects</b>, trees
  and blobs will not have their associated path printed.</div>
<p class="Pp">--progress=&lt;header&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show progress reports on stderr as objects are
  considered. The <b>&lt;header&gt;</b> text will be printed with each progress
  update.</div>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="History_Simplification"><a class="permalink" href="#History_Simplification">History
  Simplification</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for
    example the commits modifying a particular &lt;path&gt;. But there are two
    parts of <i>History Simplification</i>, one part is selecting the commits
    and the other is how to do it, as there are various strategies to simplify
    the history.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following options select the commits to be shown:</p>
<p class="Pp">&lt;paths&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commits modifying the given &lt;paths&gt; are
  selected.</div>
<p class="Pp">--simplify-by-decoration</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commits that are referred by some branch or tag are
  selected.</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that extra commits can be shown to give a meaningful
  history.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following options affect the way the simplification is
    performed:</p>
<p class="Pp">Default mode</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Simplifies the history to the simplest history explaining
  the final state of the tree. Simplest because it prunes some side branches if
  the end result is the same (i.e. merging branches with the same content)</div>
<p class="Pp">--show-pulls</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Include all commits from the default mode, but also any
  merge commits that are not TREESAME to the first parent but are TREESAME to a
  later parent. This mode is helpful for showing the merge commits that
  &quot;first introduced&quot; a change to a branch.</div>
<p class="Pp">--full-history</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Same as the default mode, but does not prune some
  history.</div>
<p class="Pp">--dense</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only the selected commits are shown, plus some to have a
  meaningful history.</div>
<p class="Pp">--sparse</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">All commits in the simplified history are shown.</div>
<p class="Pp">--simplify-merges</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Additional option to <b>--full-history</b> to remove some
  needless merges from the resulting history, as there are no selected commits
  contributing to this merge.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ancestry-path</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When given a range of commits to display (e.g.
  <i>commit1..commit2</i> or <i>commit2 ^commit1</i>), only display commits that
  exist directly on the ancestry chain between the <i>commit1</i> and
  <i>commit2</i>, i.e. commits that are both descendants of <i>commit1</i>, and
  ancestors of <i>commit2</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">A more detailed explanation follows.</p>
<p class="Pp">Suppose you specified <b>foo</b> as the &lt;paths&gt;. We shall
    call commits that modify <b>foo</b> !TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME. (In a
    diff filtered for <b>foo</b>, they look different and equal,
  respectively.)</p>
<p class="Pp">In the following, we will always refer to the same example history
    to illustrate the differences between simplification settings. We assume
    that you are filtering for a file <b>foo</b> in this commit graph:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
         /     /   /   /   /   /
        I     B   C   D   E   Y
         \   /   /   /   /   /
          `-------------'   X
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The horizontal line of history A---Q is taken to be the first
    parent of each merge. The commits are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>I</b> is the initial commit, in which
  <b>foo</b> exists with contents &#x201C;asdf&#x201D;, and a file <b>quux</b>
  exists with contents &#x201C;quux&#x201D;. Initial commits are compared to an
  empty tree, so <b>I</b> is !TREESAME.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;In <b>A</b>, <b>foo</b> contains just
  &#x201C;foo&#x201D;.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>B</b> contains the same change as <b>A</b>.
  Its merge <b>M</b> is trivial and hence TREESAME to all parents.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>C</b> does not change <b>foo</b>, but its
  merge <b>N</b> changes it to &#x201C;foobar&#x201D;, so it is not TREESAME to
  any parent.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>D</b> sets <b>foo</b> to &#x201C;baz&#x201D;.
  Its merge <b>O</b> combines the strings from <b>N</b> and <b>D</b> to
  &#x201C;foobarbaz&#x201D;; i.e., it is not TREESAME to any parent.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>E</b> changes <b>quux</b> to
  &#x201C;xyzzy&#x201D;, and its merge <b>P</b> combines the strings to
  &#x201C;quux xyzzy&#x201D;. <b>P</b> is TREESAME to <b>O</b>, but not to
  <b>E</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>X</b> is an independent root commit that added
  a new file <b>side</b>, and <b>Y</b> modified it. <b>Y</b> is TREESAME to
  <b>X</b>. Its merge <b>Q</b> added <b>side</b> to <b>P</b>, and <b>Q</b> is
  TREESAME to <b>P</b>, but not to <b>Y</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>rev-list</b> walks backwards through history, including or
    excluding commits based on whether <b>--full-history</b> and/or parent
    rewriting (via <b>--parents</b> or <b>--children</b>) are used. The
    following settings are available.</p>
<p class="Pp">Default mode</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any
  parent (though this can be changed, see <b>--sparse</b> below). If the commit
  was a merge, and it was TREESAME to one parent, follow only that parent. (Even
  if there are several TREESAME parents, follow only one of them.) Otherwise,
  follow all parents.
<p class="Pp">This results in:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          .-A---N---O
         /     /   /
        I---------D
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is
    available, removed <b>B</b> from consideration entirely. <b>C</b> was
    considered via <b>N</b>, but is TREESAME. Root commits are compared to an
    empty tree, so <b>I</b> is !TREESAME.</p>
<p class="Pp">Parent/child relations are only visible with <b>--parents</b>, but
    that does not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we have shown
    the parent lines.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--full-history without parent rewriting</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This mode differs from the default in one point: always
  follow all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them. Even if
  more than one side of the merge has commits that are included, this does not
  imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we get
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        I  A  B  N  D  O  P  Q
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>M</b> was excluded because it is TREESAME to both parents.
    <b>E</b>, <b>C</b> and <b>B</b> were all walked, but only <b>B</b> was
    !TREESAME, so the others do not appear.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to
    talk about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so we show
    them disconnected.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--full-history with parent rewriting</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME
  (though this can be changed, see <b>--sparse</b> below).
<p class="Pp">Merges are always included. However, their parent list is
    rewritten: Along each parent, prune away commits that are not included
    themselves. This results in</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
         /     /   /   /   /

         \   /   /   /   /
          `-------------'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Compare to <b>--full-history</b> without rewriting above. Note
    that <b>E</b> was pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the parent list of
    P was rewritten to contain <b>E</b>'s parent <b>I</b>. The same happened for
    <b>C</b> and <b>N</b>, and <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b> and <b>Q</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME
    affects inclusion:</p>
<p class="Pp">--dense</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commits that are walked are included if they are not
  TREESAME to any parent.</div>
<p class="Pp">--sparse</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">All commits that are walked are included.
<p class="Pp">Note that without <b>--full-history</b>, this still simplifies
    merges: if one of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one, so the
    other sides of the merge are never walked.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--simplify-merges</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">First, build a history graph in the same way that
  <b>--full-history</b> with parent rewriting does (see above).
<p class="Pp">Then simplify each commit <b>C</b> to its replacement <b>C'</b> in
    the final history according to the following rules:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Set <b>C'</b> to <b>C</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Replace each parent <b>P</b> of <b>C'</b> with
  its simplification <b>P'</b>. In the process, drop parents that are ancestors
  of other parents or that are root commits TREESAME to an empty tree, and
  remove duplicates, but take care to never drop all parents that we are
  TREESAME to.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If after this parent rewriting, <b>C'</b> is a
  root or merge commit (has zero or &gt;1 parents), a boundary commit, or
  !TREESAME, it remains. Otherwise, it is replaced with its only parent.</div>
<p class="Pp">The effect of this is best shown by way of comparing to
    <b>--full-history</b> with parent rewriting. The example turns into:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          .-A---M---N---O
         /     /       /
        I     B       D
         \   /       /
          `---------'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note the major differences in <b>N</b>, <b>P</b>, and <b>Q</b>
    over <b>--full-history</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>N</b>'s parent list had <b>I</b> removed,
  because it is an ancestor of the other parent <b>M</b>. Still, <b>N</b>
  remained because it is !TREESAME.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>P</b>'s parent list similarly had <b>I</b>
  removed. <b>P</b> was then removed completely, because it had one parent and
  is TREESAME.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>Q</b>'s parent list had <b>Y</b> simplified to
  <b>X</b>. <b>X</b> was then removed, because it was a TREESAME root. <b>Q</b>
  was then removed completely, because it had one parent and is TREESAME.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">There is another simplification mode available:</p>
<p class="Pp">--ancestry-path</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the displayed commits to those directly on the
  ancestry chain between the &#x201C;from&#x201D; and &#x201C;to&#x201D; commits
  in the given commit range. I.e. only display commits that are ancestor of the
  &#x201C;to&#x201D; commit and descendants of the &#x201C;from&#x201D; commit.
<p class="Pp">As an example use case, consider the following commit history:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
            D---E-------F
           /     \       \
          B---C---G---H---I---J
         /                     \
        A-------K---------------L--M
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">A regular <i>D..M</i> computes the set of commits that are
    ancestors of <b>M</b>, but excludes the ones that are ancestors of <b>D</b>.
    This is useful to see what happened to the history leading to <b>M</b> since
    <b>D</b>, in the sense that &#x201C;what does <b>M</b> have that did not
    exist in <b>D</b>&#x201D;. The result in this example would be all the
    commits, except <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> (and <b>D</b> itself, of course).</p>
<p class="Pp">When we want to find out what commits in <b>M</b> are contaminated
    with the bug introduced by <b>D</b> and need fixing, however, we might want
    to view only the subset of <i>D..M</i> that are actually descendants of
    <b>D</b>, i.e. excluding <b>C</b> and <b>K</b>. This is exactly what the
    <b>--ancestry-path</b> option does. Applied to the <i>D..M</i> range, it
    results in:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
                E-------F
                 \       \
                  G---H---I---J
                               \
                                L--M
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Before discussing another option, <b>--show-pulls</b>, we need to
    create a new example history.</p>
<p class="Pp">A common problem users face when looking at simplified history is
    that a commit they know changed a file somehow does not appear in the
    file&#x2019;s simplified history. Let&#x2019;s demonstrate a new example and
    show how options such as <b>--full-history</b> and <b>--simplify-merges</b>
    works in that case:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          .-A---M-----C--N---O---P
         /     / \  \  \/   /   /
        I     B   \  R-'`-Z'   /
         \   /     \/         /
          \ /      /\        /
           `---X--'  `---Y--'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">For this example, suppose <b>I</b> created <b>file.txt</b> which
    was modified by <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>X</b> in different ways. The
    single-parent commits <b>C</b>, <b>Z</b>, and <b>Y</b> do not change
    <b>file.txt</b>. The merge commit <b>M</b> was created by resolving the
    merge conflict to include both changes from <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> and hence
    is not TREESAME to either. The merge commit <b>R</b>, however, was created
    by ignoring the contents of <b>file.txt</b> at <b>M</b> and taking only the
    contents of <b>file.txt</b> at <b>X</b>. Hence, <b>R</b> is TREESAME to
    <b>X</b> but not <b>M</b>. Finally, the natural merge resolution to create
    <b>N</b> is to take the contents of <b>file.txt</b> at <b>R</b>, so <b>N</b>
    is TREESAME to <b>R</b> but not <b>C</b>. The merge commits <b>O</b> and
    <b>P</b> are TREESAME to their first parents, but not to their second
    parents, <b>Z</b> and <b>Y</b> respectively.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using the default mode, <b>N</b> and <b>R</b> both have a
    TREESAME parent, so those edges are walked and the others are ignored. The
    resulting history graph is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        I---X
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">When using <b>--full-history</b>, Git walks every edge. This will
    discover the commits <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> and the merge <b>M</b>, but also
    will reveal the merge commits <b>O</b> and <b>P</b>. With parent rewriting,
    the resulting graph is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          .-A---M--------N---O---P
         /     / \  \  \/   /   /
        I     B   \  R-'`--'   /
         \   /     \/         /
          \ /      /\        /
           `---X--'  `------'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Here, the merge commits <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> contribute extra
    noise, as they did not actually contribute a change to <b>file.txt</b>. They
    only merged a topic that was based on an older version of <b>file.txt</b>.
    This is a common issue in repositories using a workflow where many
    contributors work in parallel and merge their topic branches along a single
    trunk: manu unrelated merges appear in the <b>--full-history</b>
  results.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using the <b>--simplify-merges</b> option, the commits
    <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> disappear from the results. This is because the
    rewritten second parents of <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> are reachable from their
    first parents. Those edges are removed and then the commits look like
    single-parent commits that are TREESAME to their parent. This also happens
    to the commit <b>N</b>, resulting in a history view as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          .-A---M--.
         /     /    \
        I     B      R
         \   /      /
          \ /      /
           `---X--'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">In this view, we see all of the important single-parent changes
    from <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>X</b>. We also see the carefully-resolved
    merge <b>M</b> and the not-so-carefully-resolved merge <b>R</b>. This is
    usually enough information to determine why the commits <b>A</b> and
    <b>B</b> &quot;disappeared&quot; from history in the default view. However,
    there are a few issues with this approach.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first issue is performance. Unlike any previous option, the
    <b>--simplify-merges</b> option requires walking the entire commit history
    before returning a single result. This can make the option difficult to use
    for very large repositories.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second issue is one of auditing. When many contributors are
    working on the same repository, it is important which merge commits
    introduced a change into an important branch. The problematic merge <b>R</b>
    above is not likely to be the merge commit that was used to merge into an
    important branch. Instead, the merge <b>N</b> was used to merge <b>R</b> and
    <b>X</b> into the important branch. This commit may have information about
    why the change <b>X</b> came to override the changes from <b>A</b> and
    <b>B</b> in its commit message.</p>
<p class="Pp">--show-pulls</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to the commits shown in the default history,
  show each merge commit that is not TREESAME to its first parent but is
  TREESAME to a later parent.
<p class="Pp">When a merge commit is included by <b>--show-pulls</b>, the merge
    is treated as if it &quot;pulled&quot; the change from another branch. When
    using <b>--show-pulls</b> on this example (and no other options) the
    resulting graph is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        I---X---R---N
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Here, the merge commits <b>R</b> and <b>N</b> are included because
    they pulled the commits <b>X</b> and <b>R</b> into the base branch,
    respectively. These merges are the reason the commits <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>
    do not appear in the default history.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>--show-pulls</b> is paired with <b>--simplify-merges</b>,
    the graph includes all of the necessary information:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          .-A---M--.   N
         /     /    \ /
        I     B      R
         \   /      /
          \ /      /
           `---X--'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Notice that since <b>M</b> is reachable from <b>R</b>, the edge
    from <b>N</b> to <b>M</b> was simplified away. However, <b>N</b> still
    appears in the history as an important commit because it &quot;pulled&quot;
    the change <b>R</b> into the main branch.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <b>--simplify-by-decoration</b> option allows you to view only
    the big picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits that are
    not referenced by tags. Commits are marked as !TREESAME (in other words,
    kept after history simplification rules described above) if (1) they are
    referenced by tags, or (2) they change the contents of the paths given on
    the command line. All other commits are marked as TREESAME (subject to be
    simplified away).</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">Limit output to the one commit object which is roughly
  halfway between included and excluded commits. Note that the bad bisection ref

    <i>--filter=combine:&lt;filter1&gt;+&lt;filter2&gt;+...&lt;filterN&gt;</i>
    can also be used to combined several filters, but this is harder than just
    repeating the <i>--filter</i> flag and is usually not necessary. Filters are
    joined by <i>+</i> and individual filters are %-encoded (i.e. URL-encoded).
    Besides the <i>+</i> and <i>%</i> characters, the following characters are
    reserved and also must be encoded:
    <b>~!@#$^&amp;*()[]{}\;&quot;,&lt;&gt;?</b><b>'`</b> as well as all
    characters with ASCII code &lt;= <b>0x20</b>, which includes space and
    newline.</p>
<p class="Pp">Other arbitrary characters can also be encoded. For instance,
    <i>combine:tree:3+blob:none</i> and <i>combine:tree%3A3+blob%3Anone</i> are
    equivalent.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-filter</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn off any previous <b>--filter=</b> argument.</div>
<p class="Pp">--filter-provided-objects</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Filter the list of explicitly provided objects, which
  would otherwise always be printed even if they did not match any of the
  filters. Only useful with <b>--filter=</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--filter-print-omitted</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only useful with <b>--filter=</b>; prints a list of the
  objects omitted by the filter. Object IDs are prefixed with a
  &#x201C;~&#x201D; character.</div>
<p class="Pp">--missing=&lt;missing-action&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A debug option to help with future &quot;partial
  clone&quot; development. This option specifies how missing objects are
  handled.
<p class="Pp">The form <i>--missing=error</i> requests that rev-list stop with
    an error if a missing object is encountered. This is the default action.</p>
<p class="Pp">The form <i>--missing=allow-any</i> will allow object traversal to
    continue if a missing object is encountered. Missing objects will silently
    be omitted from the results.</p>
<p class="Pp">The form <i>--missing=allow-promisor</i> is like <i>allow-any</i>,
    but will only allow object traversal to continue for EXPECTED promisor
    missing objects. Unexpected missing objects will raise an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">The form <i>--missing=print</i> is like <i>allow-any</i>, but will
    also print a list of the missing objects. Object IDs are prefixed with a
    &#x201C;?&#x201D; character.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--exclude-promisor-objects</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">(For internal use only.) Prefilter object traversal at
  promisor boundary. This is used with partial clone. This is stronger than
  <b>--missing=allow-promisor</b> because it limits the traversal, rather than
  just silencing errors about missing objects.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-walk[=(sorted|unsorted)]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only show the given commits, but do not traverse their
  ancestors. This has no effect if a range is specified. If the argument
  <b>unsorted</b> is given, the commits are shown in the order they were given
  on the command line. Otherwise (if <b>sorted</b> or no argument was given),
  the commits are shown in reverse chronological order by commit time. Cannot be
  combined with <b>--graph</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--do-walk</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Overrides a previous <b>--no-walk</b>.</div>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Commit_Formatting"><a class="permalink" href="#Commit_Formatting">Commit
  Formatting</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Using these options, <b>git-rev-list</b>(1) will act similar to
    the more specialized family of commit log tools: <b>git-log</b>(1),
    <b>git-show</b>(1), and <b>git-whatchanged</b>(1)</p>
<p class="Pp">--pretty[=&lt;format&gt;], --format=&lt;format&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretty-print the contents of the commit logs in a given
  format, where <i>&lt;format&gt;</i> can be one of <i>oneline</i>,
  <i>short</i>, <i>medium</i>, <i>full</i>, <i>fuller</i>, <i>reference</i>,
  <i>email</i>, <i>raw</i>, <i>format:&lt;string&gt;</i> and
  <i>tformat:&lt;string&gt;</i>. When <i>&lt;format&gt;</i> is none of the
  above, and has <i>%placeholder</i> in it, it acts as if
  <i>--pretty=tformat:&lt;format&gt;</i> were given.
<p class="Pp">See the &quot;PRETTY FORMATS&quot; section for some additional
    details for each format. When <i>=&lt;format&gt;</i> part is omitted, it
    defaults to <i>medium</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository
    configuration (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--abbrev-commit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit
  object name, show a prefix that names the object uniquely.
  &quot;--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;&quot; (which also modifies diff output, if it is
  displayed) option can be used to specify the minimum length of the prefix.
<p class="Pp">This should make &quot;--pretty=oneline&quot; a whole lot more
    readable for people using 80-column terminals.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-abbrev-commit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name.
  This negates <b>--abbrev-commit</b>, either explicit or implied by other
  options such as &quot;--oneline&quot;. It also overrides the
  <b>log.abbrevCommit</b> variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">--oneline</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is a shorthand for &quot;--pretty=oneline
  --abbrev-commit&quot; used together.</div>
<p class="Pp">--encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commit objects record the character encoding used for the
  log message in their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the
  command to re-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by the
  user. For non plumbing commands this defaults to UTF-8. Note that if an object
  claims to be encoded in <b>X</b> and we are outputting in <b>X</b>, we will
  output the object verbatim; this means that invalid sequences in the original
  commit may be copied to the output. Likewise, if iconv(3) fails to convert the
  commit, we will quietly output the original object verbatim.</div>
<p class="Pp">--expand-tabs=&lt;n&gt;, --expand-tabs, --no-expand-tabs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Perform a tab expansion (replace each tab with enough
  spaces to fill to the next display column that is multiple of
  <i>&lt;n&gt;</i>) in the log message before showing it in the output.
  <b>--expand-tabs</b> is a short-hand for <b>--expand-tabs=8</b>, and
  <b>--no-expand-tabs</b> is a short-hand for <b>--expand-tabs=0</b>, which
  disables tab expansion.
<p class="Pp">By default, tabs are expanded in pretty formats that indent the
    log message by 4 spaces (i.e. <i>medium</i>, which is the default,
    <i>full</i>, and <i>fuller</i>).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--show-signature</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Check the validity of a signed commit object by passing
  the signature to <b>gpg --verify</b> and show the output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--relative-date</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for <b>--date=relative</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--date=&lt;format&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only takes effect for dates shown in human-readable
  format, such as when using <b>--pretty</b>. <b>log.date</b> config variable
  sets a default value for the log command&#x2019;s <b>--date</b> option. By
  default, dates are shown in the original time zone (either committer&#x2019;s
  or author&#x2019;s). If <b>-local</b> is appended to the format (e.g.,
  <b>iso-local</b>), the user&#x2019;s local time zone is used instead.
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=relative</b> shows dates relative to the current time,
    e.g. &#x201C;2 hours ago&#x201D;. The <b>-local</b> option has no effect for
    <b>--date=relative</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=local</b> is an alias for
  <b>--date=default-local</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=iso</b> (or <b>--date=iso8601</b>) shows timestamps in a
    ISO 8601-like format. The differences to the strict ISO 8601 format are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;a space instead of the <b>T</b> date/time
  delimiter</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;a space between time and time zone</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;no colon between hours and minutes of the time
  zone</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=iso-strict</b> (or <b>--date=iso8601-strict</b>) shows
    timestamps in strict ISO 8601 format.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=rfc</b> (or <b>--date=rfc2822</b>) shows timestamps in
    RFC 2822 format, often found in email messages.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=short</b> shows only the date, but not the time, in
    <b>YYYY-MM-DD</b> format.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=raw</b> shows the date as seconds since the epoch
    (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), followed by a space, and then the timezone as an
    offset from UTC (a <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> with four digits; the first two are
    hours, and the second two are minutes). I.e., as if the timestamp were
    formatted with <b>strftime(&quot;%s %z&quot;)</b>). Note that the
    <b>-local</b> option does not affect the seconds-since-epoch value (which is
    always measured in UTC), but does switch the accompanying timezone
  value.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=human</b> shows the timezone if the timezone does not
    match the current time-zone, and doesn&#x2019;t print the whole date if that
    matches (ie skip printing year for dates that are &quot;this year&quot;, but
    also skip the whole date itself if it&#x2019;s in the last few days and we
    can just say what weekday it was). For older dates the hour and minute is
    also omitted.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=unix</b> shows the date as a Unix epoch timestamp
    (seconds since 1970). As with <b>--raw</b>, this is always in UTC and
    therefore <b>-local</b> has no effect.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=format:...</b> feeds the format <b>...</b> to your
    system <b>strftime</b>, except for %s, %z, and %Z, which are handled
    internally. Use <b>--date=format:%c</b> to show the date in your system
    locale&#x2019;s preferred format. See the <b>strftime</b> manual for a
    complete list of format placeholders. When using <b>-local</b>, the correct
    syntax is <b>--date=format-local:...</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=default</b> is the default format, and is similar to
    <b>--date=rfc2822</b>, with a few exceptions:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;there is no comma after the day-of-week</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the time zone is omitted when the local time zone
  is used</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--header</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print the contents of the commit in raw-format; each
  record is separated with a NUL character.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-commit-header</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Suppress the header line containing &quot;commit&quot;
  and the object ID printed before the specified format. This has no effect on
  the built-in formats; only custom formats are affected.</div>
<p class="Pp">--commit-header</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Overrides a previous <b>--no-commit-header</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--parents</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print also the parents of the commit (in the form
  &quot;commit parent...&quot;). Also enables parent rewriting, see <i>History
  Simplification</i> above.</div>
<p class="Pp">--children</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print also the children of the commit (in the form
  &quot;commit child...&quot;). Also enables parent rewriting, see <i>History
  Simplification</i> above.</div>
<p class="Pp">--timestamp</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print the raw commit timestamp.</div>
<p class="Pp">--left-right</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Mark which side of a symmetric difference a commit is
  reachable from. Commits from the left side are prefixed with <b>&lt;</b> and
  those from the right with <b>&gt;</b>. If combined with <b>--boundary</b>,
  those commits are prefixed with <b>-</b>.
<p class="Pp">For example, if you have this topology:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
             y---b---b  branch B
            / \ /
           /   .
          /   / \
         o---x---a---a  branch A
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">you would get an output like this:</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        $ git rev-list --left-right --boundary --pretty=oneline A...B
        &gt;bbbbbbb... 3rd on b

        &lt;aaaaaaa... 3rd on a
        &lt;aaaaaaa... 2nd on a
        -yyyyyyy... 1st on b
        -xxxxxxx... 1st on a
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--graph</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Draw a text-based graphical representation of the commit
  history on the left hand side of the output. This may cause extra lines to be
  printed in between commits, in order for the graph history to be drawn
  properly. Cannot be combined with <b>--no-walk</b>.
<p class="Pp">This enables parent rewriting, see <i>History Simplification</i>
    above.</p>
<p class="Pp">This implies the <b>--topo-order</b> option by default, but the
    <b>--date-order</b> option may also be specified.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--show-linear-break[=&lt;barrier&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When --graph is not used, all history branches are
  flattened which can make it hard to see that the two consecutive commits do
  not belong to a linear branch. This option puts a barrier in between them in
  that case. If <b>&lt;barrier&gt;</b> is specified, it is the string that will
  be shown instead of the default one.</div>
<p class="Pp">--count</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print a number stating how many commits would have been
  listed, and suppress all other output. When used together with
  <b>--left-right</b>, instead print the counts for left and right commits,
  separated by a tab. When used together with <b>--cherry-mark</b>, omit patch
  equivalent commits from these counts and print the count for equivalent
  commits separated by a tab.</div>

<p class="Pp">If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty-format is not
    <i>oneline</i>, <i>email</i> or <i>raw</i>, an additional line is inserted
    before the <i>Author:</i> line. This line begins with &quot;Merge: &quot;
    and the hashes of ancestral commits are printed, separated by spaces. Note
    that the listed commits may not necessarily be the list of the <b>direct</b>
    parent commits if you have limited your view of history: for example, if you
    are only interested in changes related to a certain directory or file.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are several built-in formats, and you can define additional
    formats by setting a pretty.&lt;name&gt; config option to either another

<p class="Pp">This format is used to refer to another commit in a commit message

    commit.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>raw</i>
<p class="Pp">The <i>raw</i> format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in
    the commit object. Notably, the hashes are displayed in full, regardless of
    whether --abbrev or --no-abbrev are used, and <i>parents</i> information
    show the true parent commits, without taking grafts or history
    simplification into account. Note that this format affects the way commits
    are displayed, but not the way the diff is shown e.g. with <b>git log
    --raw</b>. To get full object names in a raw diff format, use
    <b>--no-abbrev</b>.</p>

<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>format:&lt;format-string&gt;</i>
<p class="Pp">The <i>format:&lt;format-string&gt;</i> format allows you to
    specify which information you want to show. It works a little bit like
    printf format, with the notable exception that you get a newline with
    <i>%n</i> instead of <i>\n</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">E.g, <i>format:&quot;The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was

  the former if we are going to a terminal). <b>%C(auto,...)</b> is accepted as
  a historical synonym for the default (e.g., <b>%C(auto,red)</b>). Specifying
  <b>%C(always,...)</b> will show the colors even when color is not otherwise
  enabled (though consider just using <b>--color=always</b> to enable color for
  the whole output, including this format and anything else git might color).
  <b>auto</b> alone (i.e. <b>%C(auto)</b>) will turn on auto coloring on the

<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>key=&lt;key&gt;</i>: only show trailers with
  specified &lt;key&gt;. Matching is done case-insensitively and trailing colon
  is optional. If option is given multiple times trailer lines matching any of
  the keys are shown. This option automatically enables the <b>only</b> option
  so that non-trailer lines in the trailer block are hidden. If that is not
  desired it can be disabled with <b>only=false</b>. E.g.,
  <b>%(trailers:key=Reviewed-by)</b> shows trailer lines with key
  <b>Reviewed-by</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>only[=&lt;bool&gt;]</i>: select whether
  non-trailer lines from the trailer block should be included.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>separator=&lt;sep&gt;</i>: specify a separator
  inserted between trailer lines. When this option is not given each trailer
  line is terminated with a line feed character. The string &lt;sep&gt; may
  contain the literal formatting codes described above. To use comma as
  separator one must use <b>%x2C</b> as it would otherwise be parsed as next
  option. E.g., <b>%(trailers:key=Ticket,separator=%x2C )</b> shows all trailer
  lines whose key is &quot;Ticket&quot; separated by a comma and a space.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>unfold[=&lt;bool&gt;]</i>: make it behave as
  if interpret-trailer&#x2019;s <b>--unfold</b> option was given. E.g.,
  <b>%(trailers:only,unfold=true)</b> unfolds and shows all trailer lines.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>keyonly[=&lt;bool&gt;]</i>: only show the key
  part of the trailer.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>valueonly[=&lt;bool&gt;]</i>: only show the
  value part of the trailer.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>key_value_separator=&lt;sep&gt;</i>: specify a
  separator inserted between trailer lines. When this option is not given each
  trailer key-value pair is separated by &quot;: &quot;. Otherwise it shares the
  same semantics as <i>separator=&lt;sep&gt;</i> above.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">Some placeholders may depend on other options given to the
    revision traversal engine. For example, the <b>%g*</b> reflog options will
    insert an empty string unless we are traversing reflog entries (e.g., by
    <b>git log -g</b>). The <b>%d</b> and <b>%D</b> placeholders will use the
    &quot;short&quot; decoration format if <b>--decorate</b> was not already
    provided on the command line.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The boolean options accept an optional value
    <b>[=&lt;bool-value&gt;]</b>. The values <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>,
    <b>on</b>, <b>off</b> etc. are all accepted. See the &quot;boolean&quot;
    sub-section in &quot;EXAMPLES&quot; in <b>git-config</b>(1). If a boolean
    option is given with no value, it&#x2019;s enabled.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you add a <b>+</b> (plus sign) after <i>%</i> of a placeholder,
    a line-feed is inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the
    placeholder expands to a non-empty string.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you add a <b>-</b> (minus sign) after <i>%</i> of a
    placeholder, all consecutive line-feeds immediately preceding the expansion
    are deleted if and only if the placeholder expands to an empty string.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you add a ` ` (space) after <i>%</i> of a placeholder, a space
    is inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the placeholder
    expands to a non-empty string.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>tformat:</i>
<p class="Pp">The <i>tformat:</i> format works exactly like <i>format:</i>,
    except that it provides &quot;terminator&quot; semantics instead of
    &quot;separator&quot; semantics. In other words, each commit has the message
    terminator character (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator
    placed between entries. This means that the final entry of a single-line
    format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the
    &quot;oneline&quot; format does. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git log -2 --pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \
  | perl -pe '$_ .= &quot; -- NO NEWLINE\n&quot; unless /\n/'
4da45be
7134973 -- NO NEWLINE
$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef \
  | perl -pe '$_ .= &quot; -- NO NEWLINE\n&quot; unless /\n/'
4da45be
7134973
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In addition, any unrecognized string that has a <b>%</b> in it is
    interpreted as if it has <b>tformat:</b> in front of it. For example, these
    two are equivalent:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef
$ git log -2 --pretty=%h 4da45bef
