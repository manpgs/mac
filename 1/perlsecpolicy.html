<p class="Pp">The Perl project takes security issues seriously.</p>
<p class="Pp">The responsibility for handling security reports in a timely and
    effective manner has been delegated to a security team composed of a subset
    of the Perl core developers.</p>
<p class="Pp">This document describes how the Perl security team operates and
    how the team evaluates new security reports.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="REPORTING_SECURITY_ISSUES_IN_PERL"><a class="permalink" href="#REPORTING_SECURITY_ISSUES_IN_PERL">REPORTING
  SECURITY ISSUES IN PERL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the Perl
    interpreter or modules maintained in the core Perl codebase, email the
    details to perl-security@perl.org &lt;mailto:perl-security@perl.org&gt;.
    This address is a closed membership mailing list monitored by the Perl
    security team.</p>
<p class="Pp">You should receive an initial response to your report within 72
    hours. If you do not receive a response in that time, please contact the
    Perl Steering Council &lt;mailto:steering-council@perl.org&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">When members of the security team reply to your messages, they
    will generally include the perl-security@perl.org address in the
    &quot;To&quot; or &quot;CC&quot; fields of the response. This allows all of
    the security team to follow the discussion and chime in as needed. Use the
    &quot;Reply-all&quot; functionality of your email client when you send
    subsequent responses so that the entire security team receives the
  message.</p>
<p class="Pp">The security team will evaluate your report and make an initial
    determination of whether it is likely to fit the scope of issues the team
    handles. General guidelines about how this is determined are detailed in the
    &quot;WHAT ARE SECURITY ISSUES&quot; section.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your report meets the team's criteria, an issue will be opened
    in the team's private issue tracker and you will be provided the issue's ID
    number. Issue identifiers have the form perl-security#NNN. Include this
    identifier with any subsequent messages you send.</p>
<p class="Pp">The security team will send periodic updates about the status of
    your issue and guide you through any further action that is required to
    complete the vulnerability remediation process. The stages vulnerabilities
    typically go through are explained in the &quot;HOW WE DEAL WITH SECURITY
    ISSUES&quot; section.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="WHAT_ARE_SECURITY_ISSUES"><a class="permalink" href="#WHAT_ARE_SECURITY_ISSUES">WHAT
  ARE SECURITY ISSUES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A vulnerability is a behavior of a software system that
    compromises the system's expected confidentiality, integrity or availability
    protections.</p>
<p class="Pp">A security issue is a bug in one or more specific components of a
    software system that creates a vulnerability.</p>
<p class="Pp">Software written in the Perl programming language is typically
    composed of many layers of software written by many different groups. It can
    be very complicated to determine which specific layer of a complex
    real-world application was responsible for preventing a vulnerable behavior,
    but this is an essential part of fixing the vulnerability.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Software_covered_by_the_Perl_security_team"><a class="permalink" href="#Software_covered_by_the_Perl_security_team">Software
  covered by the Perl security team</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Perl security team handles security issues in:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The Perl interpreter</li>
  <li>The Perl modules shipped with the interpreter that are developed in the
      core Perl repository</li>
  <li>The command line tools shipped with the interpreter that are developed in
      the core Perl repository</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Files under the <i>cpan/</i> directory in Perl's repository and
    release tarballs are developed and maintained independently. The Perl
    security team does not handle security issues for these modules.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Bugs_that_may_qualify_as_security_issues_in_Perl"><a class="permalink" href="#Bugs_that_may_qualify_as_security_issues_in_Perl">Bugs
  that may qualify as security issues in Perl</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl is designed to be a fast and flexible general purpose
    programming language. The Perl interpreter and Perl modules make writing
    safe and secure applications easy, but they do have limitations.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a general rule, a bug in Perl needs to meet all of the
    following criteria to be considered a security issue:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The vulnerable behavior is not mentioned in Perl's documentation or public
      issue tracker.</li>
  <li>The vulnerable behavior is not implied by an expected behavior.</li>
  <li>The vulnerable behavior is not a generally accepted limitation of the
      implementation.</li>
  <li>The vulnerable behavior is likely to be exposed to attack in otherwise
      secure applications written in Perl.</li>
  <li>The vulnerable behavior provides a specific tangible benefit to an
      attacker that triggers the behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Bugs_that_do_not_qualify_as_security_issues_in_Perl"><a class="permalink" href="#Bugs_that_do_not_qualify_as_security_issues_in_Perl">Bugs
  that do not qualify as security issues in Perl</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There are certain categories of bugs that are frequently reported
    to the security team that do not meet the criteria listed above.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following is a list of commonly reported bugs that are not
    handled as security issues.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Feeding untrusted code to the interpreter</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The Perl parser is not designed to evaluate untrusted code. If
    your application requires the evaluation of untrusted code, it should rely
    on an operating system level sandbox for its security.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Stack overflows due to excessive recursion</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Excessive recursion is often caused by code that does not enforce
    limits on inputs. The Perl interpreter assumes limits on recursion will be
    enforced by the application.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Out of memory errors</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Common Perl constructs such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span>, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span> operator, and regular expressions
    accept numeric quantifiers that control how much memory will be allocated to
    store intermediate values or results. If you allow an attacker to supply
    these quantifiers and consume all available memory, the Perl interpreter
    will not prevent it.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Escape from a Safe compartment</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Opcode restrictions and Safe compartments are not supported as
    security mechanisms. The Perl parser is not designed to evaluate untrusted
    code.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Use of the </i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;p&quot;</i></span><i>
    and </i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;P&quot;</i></span><i> pack
  templates</i></p>
<p class="Pp">These templates are unsafe by design.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Stack not reference-counted issues</i></p>
<p class="Pp">These bugs typically present as use-after-free errors or as
    assertion failures on the type of a <span class="Li">&quot;SV&quot;</span>.
    Stack not reference-counted crashes usually occur because code is both
    modifying a reference or glob and using the values referenced by that glob
    or reference.</p>
<p class="Pp">This type of bug is a long standing issue with the Perl
    interpreter that seldom occurs in normal code. Examples of this type of bug
    generally assume that attacker-supplied code will be evaluated by the Perl
    interpreter.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Thawing attacker-supplied data with Storable</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Storable is designed to be a very fast serialization format. It is
    not designed to be safe for deserializing untrusted inputs.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Using attacker supplied SDBM_File databases</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The SDBM_File module is not intended for use with untrusted SDBM
    databases.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Badly encoded UTF-8 flagged scalars</i></p>
<p class="Pp">This type of bug occurs when the
    <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> PerlIO layer is used to read badly
    encoded data, or other mechanisms are used to directly manipulate the UTF-8
    flag on an SV.</p>
<p class="Pp">A badly encoded UTF-8 flagged SV is not a valid SV. Code that
    creates SV's in this fashion is corrupting Perl's internal state.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Issues that exist only in blead, or in a release
  candidate</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The blead branch and Perl release candidates do not receive
    security support. Security defects that are present only in pre-release
    versions of Perl are handled through the normal bug reporting and resolution
    process.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>CPAN modules or other Perl project resources</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The Perl security team is focused on the Perl interpreter and
    modules maintained in the core Perl codebase. The team has no special access
    to fix CPAN modules, applications written in Perl, Perl project websites,
    Perl mailing lists or the Perl IRC servers.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Emulated POSIX behaviors on Windows systems</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The Perl interpreter attempts to emulate
    <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> and other POSIX behaviors on
    Windows systems. This emulation has many quirks that are extensively
    documented in Perl's public issue tracker. Changing these behaviors would
    cause significant disruption for existing users on Windows.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Bugs_that_require_special_categorization"><a class="permalink" href="#Bugs_that_require_special_categorization">Bugs
  that require special categorization</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Some bugs in the Perl interpreter occur in areas of the codebase
    that are both security sensitive and prone to failure during normal
  usage.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Regular expressions</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Untrusted regular expressions are generally safe to compile and
    match against with several caveats. The following behaviors of Perl's
    regular expression engine are the developer's responsibility to
  constrain.</p>
<p class="Pp">The evaluation of untrusted regular expressions while
    <span class="Li">&quot;use re 'eval';&quot;</span> is in effect is never
    safe.</p>
<p class="Pp">Regular expressions are not guaranteed to compile or evaluate in
    any specific finite time frame.</p>
<p class="Pp">Regular expressions may consume all available system memory when
    they are compiled or evaluated.</p>
<p class="Pp">Regular expressions may cause excessive recursion that halts the
    perl interpreter.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a general rule, do not expect Perl's regular expression engine
    to be resistant to denial of service attacks.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>DB_File, ODBM_File, or GDBM_File databases</i></p>
<p class="Pp">These modules rely on external libraries to interact with database
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Bugs caused by reading and writing these file formats are
    generally caused by the underlying library implementation and are not
    security issues in Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Bugs where Perl mishandles unexpected valid return values from the
    underlying libraries may qualify as security issues in Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Algorithmic complexity attacks</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The perl interpreter is reasonably robust to algorithmic
    complexity attacks. It is not immune to them.</p>
<p class="Pp">Algorithmic complexity bugs that depend on the interpreter
    processing extremely large amounts of attacker supplied data are not
    generally handled as security issues.</p>
<p class="Pp">See &quot;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&quot; in perlsec for
    additional information.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="HOW_WE_DEAL_WITH_SECURITY_ISSUES"><a class="permalink" href="#HOW_WE_DEAL_WITH_SECURITY_ISSUES">HOW
  WE DEAL WITH SECURITY ISSUES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The Perl security team follows responsible disclosure practices.
    Security issues are kept secret until a fix is readily available for most
    users. This minimizes inherent risks users face from vulnerabilities in
    Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Hiding problems from the users temporarily is a necessary
    trade-off to keep them safe. Hiding problems from users permanently is not
    the goal.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you report a security issue privately to the
    perl-security@perl.org &lt;mailto:perl-security@perl.org&gt; contact
    address, we normally expect you to follow responsible disclosure practices
    in the handling of the report. If you are unable or unwilling to keep the
    issue secret until a fix is available to users you should state this clearly
    in the initial report.</p>
<p class="Pp">The security team's vulnerability remediation workflow is intended
    to be as open and transparent as possible about the state of your security
    report.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Perl's_vulnerability_remediation_workflow"><a class="permalink" href="#Perl's_vulnerability_remediation_workflow">Perl's
  vulnerability remediation workflow</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><i>Initial contact</i></p>
<p class="Pp">New vulnerability reports will receive an initial reply within 72
    hours from the time they arrive at the security team's mailing list. If you
    do not receive any response in that time, contact the Perl Steering Council
    &lt;mailto:steering-council@perl.org&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The initial response sent by the security team will confirm your
    message was received and provide an estimated time frame for the security
    team's triage analysis.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Initial triage</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The security team will evaluate the report and determine whether
    or not it is likely to meet the criteria for handling as a security
  issue.</p>
<p class="Pp">The security team aims to complete the initial report triage
    within two weeks' time. Complex issues that require significant discussion
    or research may take longer.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the security report cannot be reproduced or does not meet the
    team's criteria for handling as a security issue, you will be notified by
    email and given an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Issue ID assignment</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Security reports that pass initial triage analysis are turned into
    issues in the security team's private issue tracker. When a report
    progresses to this point you will be provided the issue ID for future
    reference. These identifiers have the format perl-security#NNN or
    Perl/perl-security#NNN.</p>
<p class="Pp">The assignment of an issue ID does not confirm that a security
    report represents a vulnerability in Perl. Many reports require further
    analysis to reach that determination.</p>
<p class="Pp">Issues in the security team's private tracker are used to collect
    details about the problem and track progress towards a resolution. These
    notes and other details are not made public when the issue is resolved.
    Keeping the issue notes private allows the security team to freely discuss
    attack methods, attack tools, and other related private issues.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Development of patches</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Members of the security team will inspect the report and related
    code in detail to produce fixes for supported versions of Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the team discovers that the reported issue does not meet the
    team's criteria at this stage, you will be notified by email and given an
    opportunity to respond before the issue is closed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The team may discuss potential fixes with you or provide you with
    patches for testing purposes during this time frame. No information should
    be shared publicly at this stage.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>CVE ID assignment</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Once an issue is fully confirmed and a potential fix has been
    found, the security team will request a CVE identifier for the issue to use
    in public announcements.</p>
<p class="Pp">Details like the range of vulnerable Perl versions and identities
    of the people that discovered the flaw need to be collected to submit the
    CVE ID request.</p>
<p class="Pp">The security team may ask you to clarify the exact name we should
    use when crediting discovery of the issue. The &quot;Vulnerability credit
    and bounties&quot; section of this document explains our preferred format
    for this credit.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once a CVE ID has been assigned, you will be notified by email.
    The vulnerability should not be discussed publicly at this stage.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Pre-release notifications</i></p>
<p class="Pp">When the security team is satisfied that the fix for a security
    issue is ready to release publicly, a pre-release notification announcement
    is sent to the major redistributors of Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">This pre-release announcement includes a list of Perl versions
    that are affected by the flaw, an analysis of the risks to users, patches
    the security team has produced, and any information about mitigations or
    backporting fixes to older versions of Perl that the security team has
    available.</p>
<p class="Pp">The pre-release announcement will include a specific target date
    when the issue will be announced publicly. The time frame between the
    pre-release announcement and the release date allows redistributors to
    prepare and test their own updates and announcements. During this period the
    vulnerability details and fixes are embargoed and should not be shared
    publicly. This embargo period may be extended further if problems are
    discovered during testing.</p>
<p class="Pp">You will be sent the portions of pre-release announcements that
    are relevant to the specific issue you reported. This email will include the
    target release date. Additional updates will be sent if the target release
    date changes.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Pre-release testing</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The Perl security team does not directly produce official Perl
    releases. The team releases security fixes by placing commits in Perl's
    public git repository and sending announcements.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many users and redistributors prefer using official Perl releases
    rather than applying patches to an older release. The security team works
    with Perl's release managers to make this possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">New official releases of Perl are generally produced and tested on
    private systems during the pre-release embargo period.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Release of fixes and announcements</i></p>
<p class="Pp">At the end of the embargo period the security fixes will be
    committed to Perl's public git repository and announcements will be sent to
    the perl5-porters &lt;https://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-porters.html&gt; and
    oss-security
    &lt;https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security&gt;
    mailing lists.</p>
<p class="Pp">If official Perl releases are ready, they will be published at
    this time and announced on the perl5-porters
    &lt;https://lists.perl.org/list/perl5-porters.html&gt; mailing list.</p>
<p class="Pp">The security team will send a follow-up notification to everyone
    that participated in the pre-release embargo period once the release process
    is finished. Vulnerability reporters and Perl redistributors should not
    publish their own announcements or fixes until the Perl security team's
    release process is complete.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Publicly_known_and_zero-day_security_issues"><a class="permalink" href="#Publicly_known_and_zero-day_security_issues">Publicly
  known and zero-day security issues</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The security team's vulnerability remediation workflow assumes
    that issues are reported privately and kept secret until they are resolved.
    This isn't always the case and information occasionally leaks out before a
    fix is ready.</p>
<p class="Pp">In these situations the team must decide whether operating in
    secret increases or decreases the risk to users of Perl. In some cases being
    open about the risk a security issue creates will allow users to defend
    against it, in other cases calling attention to an unresolved security issue
    will make it more likely to be misused.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Zero-day security issues</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If an unresolved critical security issue in Perl is being actively
    abused to attack systems the security team will send out announcements as
    rapidly as possible with any mitigations the team has available.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl's public defect tracker will be used to handle the issue so
    that additional information, fixes, and CVE IDs are visible to affected
    users as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Other leaks of security issue information</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Depending on the prominence of the information revealed about a
    security issue and the issue's risk of becoming a zero-day attack, the
    security team may skip all or part of its normal remediation workflow.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the security team learns of a significant security issue after
    it has been identified and resolved in Perl's public issue tracker, the team
    will request a CVE ID and send an announcement to inform users.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Vulnerability_credit_and_bounties"><a class="permalink" href="#Vulnerability_credit_and_bounties">Vulnerability
  credit and bounties</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Perl project appreciates the effort security researchers
    invest in making Perl safe and secure.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since much of this work is hidden from the public, crediting
    researchers publicly is an important part of the vulnerability remediation
    process.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Credits in vulnerability announcements</i></p>
<p class="Pp">When security issues are fixed we will attempt to credit the
    specific researcher(s) that discovered the flaw in our announcements.</p>
<p class="Pp">Credits are announced using the researcher's preferred full
  name.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the researcher's contributions were funded by a specific
    company or part of an organized vulnerability research project, we will
    include a short name for this group at the researcher's request.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl's announcements are written in the English language using the
    7bit ASCII character set to be reproducible in a variety of formats. We do
    not include hyperlinks, domain names or marketing material with these
    acknowledgments.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the event that proper credit for vulnerability discovery cannot
    be established or there is a disagreement between the Perl security team and
    the researcher about how the credit should be given, it will be omitted from
    announcements.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Bounties for Perl vulnerabilities</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The Perl project is a non-profit volunteer effort. We do not
    provide any monetary rewards for reporting security issues in Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Internet Bug Bounty &lt;https://internetbugbounty.org/&gt;
    offers monetary rewards for some Perl security issues after they are fully
    resolved. The terms of this program are available at HackerOne
    &lt;https://hackerone.com/ibb-perl&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">This program is not run by the Perl project or the Perl security
    team.</p>
