    broken release which existed for a few hours only.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.18.1, first
    read perl5182delta, which describes differences between 5.18.1 and
  5.18.2.</p>

  <dd>Introduced by [GH #12161]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/12161&gt;, a memory leak on every
      call to <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> and backticks
      (<span class="Li">&quot; `` &quot;</span>), on most Win32 Perls starting
      from 5.18.0 has been fixed. The memory leak only occurred if you enabled
      pseudo-fork in your build of Win32 Perl, and were running that build on
      Server 2003 R2 or newer OS. The leak does not appear on WinXP SP3. [GH
      #13741] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/13741&gt;</dd>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The debugger now properly resets filehandles as needed. [perl
    #121456]</li>
  <li>A segfault in Digest::SHA has been addressed. [perl #121421]</li>
  <li>perl can again be built with USE_64_BIT_INT, with Visual C 2003, 32 bit.
      [perl #120925]</li>
  <li>A leading { (brace) in formats is properly parsed again. [perl
    #119973]</li>
  <li>Copy the values used to perturb hash iteration when cloning an
      interpreter. This was fairly harmless but caused
      <span class="Li">&quot;valgrind&quot;</span> to complain. [perl
    #121336]</li>
  <li>In Perl v5.18 <span class="Li">&quot;undef *_; goto &amp;sub&quot;</span>
      and <span class="Li">&quot;local *_; goto &amp;sub&quot;</span> started
      crashing. This has been fixed. [perl #119949]</li>

<p class="Pp">Perl 5.18.4 represents approximately 9 months of development since
    Perl 5.18.2 and contains approximately 2,000 lines of changes across 53
    files from 13 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.18.4:</p>
<p class="Pp">Daniel Dragan, David Mitchell, Doug Bell, Father Chrysostomos,
    Hiroo Hayashi, James E Keenan, Karl Williamson, Mark Shelor, Ricardo Signes,
    Shlomi Fish, Smylers, Steve Hay, Tony Cook.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
    please see the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Reporting_Bugs"><a class="permalink" href="#Reporting_Bugs">Reporting
  Bugs</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
    recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
    database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
    http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
    a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
