<p class="Pp">One of the most important new features in Perl 5 was the
    capability to manage complicated data structures like multidimensional
    arrays and nested hashes. To enable these, Perl 5 introduced a feature
    called <i>references</i>, and using references is the key to managing
    complicated, structured data in Perl. Unfortunately, there's a lot of funny
    syntax to learn, and the main manual page can be hard to follow. The manual
    is quite complete, and sometimes people find that a problem, because it can
    be hard to tell what is important and what isn't.</p>
<p class="Pp">Fortunately, you only need to know 10% of what's in the main page
    to get 90% of the benefit. This page will show you that 10%.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Who_Needs_Complicated_Data_Structures?"><a class="permalink" href="#Who_Needs_Complicated_Data_Structures?">Who
  Needs Complicated Data Structures?</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">One problem that comes up all the time is needing a hash whose
    values are lists. Perl has hashes, of course, but the values have to be
    scalars; they can't be lists.</p>
<p class="Pp">Why would you want a hash of lists? Let's take a simple example:
    You have a file of city and country names, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        Chicago, USA
        Frankfurt, Germany
        Berlin, Germany
        Washington, USA
        Helsinki, Finland
        New York, USA
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and you want to produce an output like this, with each country
    mentioned once, and then an alphabetical list of the cities in that
  country:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        Finland: Helsinki.
        Germany: Berlin, Frankfurt.
        USA:  Chicago, New York, Washington.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The natural way to do this is to have a hash whose keys are
    country names. Associated with each country name key is a list of the cities
    in that country. Each time you read a line of input, split it into a country
    and a city, look up the list of cities already known to be in that country,
    and append the new city to the list. When you're done reading the input,
    iterate over the hash as usual, sorting each list of cities before you print
    it out.</p>
<p class="Pp">If hash values couldn't be lists, you lose. You'd probably have to
    combine all the cities into a single string somehow, and then when time came
    to write the output, you'd have to break the string into a list, sort the
    list, and turn it back into a string. This is messy and error-prone. And
    it's frustrating, because Perl already has perfectly good lists that would
    solve the problem if only you could use them.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="The_Solution"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Solution">The
  Solution</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">By the time Perl 5 rolled around, we were already stuck with this
    design: Hash values must be scalars. The solution to this is references.</p>
<p class="Pp">A reference is a scalar value that <i>refers to</i> an entire
    array or an entire hash (or to just about anything else). Names are one kind
    of reference that you're already familiar with. Each human being is a messy,
    inconvenient collection of cells. But to refer to a particular human, for
    instance the first computer programmer, it isn't necessary to describe each
    of their cells; all you need is the easy, convenient scalar string &quot;Ada
    Lovelace&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">References in Perl are like names for arrays and hashes. They're
    Perl's private, internal names, so you can be sure they're unambiguous.
    Unlike a human name, a reference only refers to one thing, and you always
    know what it refers to. If you have a reference to an array, you can recover
    the entire array from it. If you have a reference to a hash, you can recover
    the entire hash. But the reference is still an easy, compact scalar
  value.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can't have a hash whose values are arrays; hash values can
    only be scalars. We're stuck with that. But a single reference can refer to
    an entire array, and references are scalars, so you can have a hash of
    references to arrays, and it'll act a lot like a hash of arrays, and it'll
    be just as useful as a hash of arrays.</p>
<p class="Pp">We'll come back to this city-country problem later, after we've
    seen some syntax for managing references.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Syntax"><a class="permalink" href="#Syntax">Syntax</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">There are just two ways to make a reference, and just two ways to
    use it once you have it.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Making_References"><a class="permalink" href="#Making_References">Making
  References</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><b><i>Make Rule 1</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">If you put a <span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span> in front of a
    variable, you get a reference to that variable.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $aref = \@array;         # $aref now holds a reference to @array
    $href = \%hash;          # $href now holds a reference to %hash
    $sref = \$scalar;        # $sref now holds a reference to $scalar
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Once the reference is stored in a variable like
    <span class="Li">$aref</span> or <span class="Li">$href</span>, you can copy
    it or store it just the same as any other scalar value:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $xy = $aref;             # $xy now holds a reference to @array
    $p[3] = $href;           # $p[3] now holds a reference to %hash
    $z = $p[3];              # $z now holds a reference to %hash
</pre>
<p class="Pp">These examples show how to make references to variables with
    names. Sometimes you want to make an array or a hash that doesn't have a
    name. This is analogous to the way you like to be able to use the string
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> or the number 80 without having to
    store it in a named variable first.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><b><i>Make Rule 2</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;[ ITEMS ]&quot;</span> makes a new,
    anonymous array, and returns a reference to that array.
    <span class="Li">&quot;{ ITEMS }&quot;</span> makes a new, anonymous hash,
    and returns a reference to that hash.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $aref = [ 1, &quot;foo&quot;, undef, 13 ];
    # $aref now holds a reference to an array
    $href = { APR =&gt; 4, AUG =&gt; 8 };
    # $href now holds a reference to a hash
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The references you get from rule 2 are the same kind of references
    that you get from rule 1:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        # This:
        $aref = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
        # Does the same as this:
        @array = (1, 2, 3);
        $aref = \@array;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The first line is an abbreviation for the following two lines,
    except that it doesn't create the superfluous array variable
    <span class="Li">@array</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you write just <span class="Li">&quot;[]&quot;</span>, you get
    a new, empty anonymous array. If you write just
    <span class="Li">&quot;{}&quot;</span>, you get a new, empty anonymous
  hash.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Using_References"><a class="permalink" href="#Using_References">Using
  References</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">What can you do with a reference once you have it? It's a scalar
    value, and we've seen that you can store it as a scalar and get it back
    again just like any scalar. There are just two more ways to use it:</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><b><i>Use Rule 1</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp">You can always use an array reference, in curly braces, in place
    of the name of an array. For example,
    <span class="Li">&quot;@{$aref}&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">@array</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here are some examples of that:</p>
<p class="Pp">Arrays:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        @a              @{$aref}                An array
        reverse @a      reverse @{$aref}        Reverse the array
        $a[3]           ${$aref}[3]             An element of the array
        $a[3] = 17;     ${$aref}[3] = 17        Assigning an element
</pre>
<p class="Pp">On each line are two expressions that do the same thing. The
    left-hand versions operate on the array <span class="Li">@a</span>. The
    right-hand versions operate on the array that is referred to by
    <span class="Li">$aref</span>. Once they find the array they're operating
    on, both versions do the same things to the arrays.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using a hash reference is <i>exactly</i> the same:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        %h              %{$href}              A hash
        keys %h         keys %{$href}         Get the keys from the hash
        $h{'red'}       ${$href}{'red'}       An element of the hash
        $h{'red'} = 17  ${$href}{'red'} = 17  Assigning an element
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Whatever you want to do with a reference, <b>Use Rule 1</b> tells
    you how to do it. You just write the Perl code that you would have written
    for doing the same thing to a regular array or hash, and then replace the
    array or hash name with <span class="Li">&quot;{$reference}&quot;</span>.
    &quot;How do I loop over an array when all I have is a reference?&quot;
    Well, to loop over an array, you would write</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        for my $element (@array) {
          ...
        }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">so replace the array name, <span class="Li">@array</span>, with
    the reference:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        for my $element (@{$aref}) {
          ...
        }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">&quot;How do I print out the contents of a hash when all I have is
    a reference?&quot; First write the code for printing out a hash:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        for my $key (keys %hash) {
          print &quot;$key =&gt; $hash{$key}\n&quot;;
        }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And then replace the hash name with the reference:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        for my $key (keys %{$href}) {
          print &quot;$key =&gt; ${$href}{$key}\n&quot;;
        }
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><b><i>Use Rule 2</i></b><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Use Rule 1</b> is all you really need, because it tells you how
    to do absolutely everything you ever need to do with references. But the
    most common thing to do with an array or a hash is to extract a single
    element, and the <b>Use Rule 1</b> notation is cumbersome. So there is an
    abbreviation.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;${$aref}[3]&quot;</span> is too hard to
    read, so you can write <span class="Li">&quot;$aref-&gt;[3]&quot;</span>
    instead.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;${$href}{red}&quot;</span> is too hard to
    read, so you can write <span class="Li">&quot;$href-&gt;{red}&quot;</span>
    instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">$aref</span> holds a reference to an array,
    then <span class="Li">&quot;$aref-&gt;[3]&quot;</span> is the fourth element
    of the array. Don't confuse this with <span class="Li">$aref[3]</span>,
    which is the fourth element of a totally different array, one deceptively
    named <span class="Li">@aref</span>. <span class="Li">$aref</span> and
    <span class="Li">@aref</span> are unrelated the same way that
    <span class="Li">$item</span> and <span class="Li">@item</span> are.</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, <span class="Li">&quot;$href-&gt;{'red'}&quot;</span>
    is part of the hash referred to by the scalar variable
    <span class="Li">$href</span>, perhaps even one with no name.
    <span class="Li">$href{'red'}</span> is part of the deceptively named
    <span class="Li">%href</span> hash. It's easy to forget to leave out the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-&gt;&quot;</span>, and if you do, you'll get bizarre
    results when your program gets array and hash elements out of totally
    unexpected hashes and arrays that weren't the ones you wanted to use.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="An_Example"><a class="permalink" href="#An_Example">An
  Example</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Let's see a quick example of how all this is useful.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, remember that <span class="Li">&quot;[1, 2, 3]&quot;</span>
    makes an anonymous array containing <span class="Li">&quot;(1, 2,
    3)&quot;</span>, and gives you a reference to that array.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now think about</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        @a = ( [1, 2, 3],
               [4, 5, 6],
               [7, 8, 9]
             );
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">@a</span> is an array with three elements, and
    each one is a reference to another array.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$a[1]</span> is one of these references. It
    refers to an array, the array containing <span class="Li">&quot;(4, 5,
    6)&quot;</span>, and because it is a reference to an array, <b>Use Rule
    2</b> says that we can write <span class="Li">$a[1]-&gt;[2]</span> to get
    the third element from that array. <span class="Li">$a[1]-&gt;[2]</span> is
    the 6. Similarly, <span class="Li">$a[0]-&gt;[1]</span> is the 2. What we
    have here is like a two-dimensional array; you can write
    <span class="Li">$a[ROW]-&gt;[COLUMN]</span> to get or set the element in
    any row and any column of the array.</p>
<p class="Pp">The notation still looks a little cumbersome, so there's one more
    abbreviation:</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Arrow_Rule"><a class="permalink" href="#Arrow_Rule">Arrow
  Rule</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In between two <b>subscripts</b>, the arrow is optional.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of <span class="Li">$a[1]-&gt;[2]</span>, we can write
    <span class="Li">$a[1][2]</span>; it means the same thing. Instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;$a[0]-&gt;[1] = 23&quot;</span>, we can write
    <span class="Li">&quot;$a[0][1] = 23&quot;</span>; it means the same
  thing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Now it really looks like two-dimensional arrays!</p>
<p class="Pp">You can see why the arrows are important. Without them, we would
    have had to write <span class="Li">&quot;${$a[1]}[2]&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">$a[1][2]</span>. For three-dimensional arrays, they let us
    write <span class="Li">$x[2][3][5]</span> instead of the unreadable
    <span class="Li">&quot;${${$x[2]}[3]}[5]&quot;</span>.</p>

<p class="Pp">Here's the answer to the problem I posed earlier, of reformatting
    a file of city and country names.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    1   my %table;
    2   while (&lt;&gt;) {
    3     chomp;
    4     my ($city, $country) = split /, /;

   11     print join ', ', sort @cities;
   12     print &quot;.\n&quot;;
   13   }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The program has two pieces: Lines 2-7 read the input and build a
    data structure, and lines 8-13 analyze the data and print out the report.
    We're going to have a hash, <span class="Li">%table</span>, whose keys are
    country names, and whose values are references to arrays of city names. The
    data structure will look like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>           %table
        +-------+---+
        |       |   |   +-----------+--------+
        |Germany| *----&gt;| Frankfurt | Berlin |
        |       |   |   +-----------+--------+
        +-------+---+
        |       |   |   +----------+
        |Finland| *----&gt;| Helsinki |
        |       |   |   +----------+
        +-------+---+
        |       |   |   +---------+------------+----------+
        |  USA  | *----&gt;| Chicago | Washington | New York |
        |       |   |   +---------+------------+----------+
        +-------+---+
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We'll look at output first. Supposing we already have this
    structure, how do we print it out?</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    8   for my $country (sort keys %table) {
    9     print &quot;$country: &quot;;
   10     my @cities = @{$table{$country}};
   11     print join ', ', sort @cities;
   12     print &quot;.\n&quot;;
   13   }
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">%table</span> is an ordinary hash, and we get a
    list of keys from it, sort the keys, and loop over the keys as usual. The
    only use of references is in line 10.
    <span class="Li">$table{$country}</span> looks up the key
    <span class="Li">$country</span> in the hash and gets the value, which is a
    reference to an array of cities in that country. <b>Use Rule 1</b> says that
    we can recover the array by saying
    <span class="Li">&quot;@{$table{$country}}&quot;</span>. Line 10 is just
    like</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        @cities = @array;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">except that the name <span class="Li">&quot;array&quot;</span> has
    been replaced by the reference
    <span class="Li">&quot;{$table{$country}}&quot;</span>. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> tells Perl to get the entire array.
    Having gotten the list of cities, we sort it, join it, and print it out as
    usual.</p>
<p class="Pp">Lines 2-7 are responsible for building the structure in the first
    place. Here they are again:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    2   while (&lt;&gt;) {
    3     chomp;
    4     my ($city, $country) = split /, /;
    5     $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country};
    6     push @{$table{$country}}, $city;
    7   }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Lines 2-4 acquire a city and country name. Line 5 looks to see if
    the country is already present as a key in the hash. If it's not, the
    program uses the <span class="Li">&quot;[]&quot;</span> notation (<b>Make
    Rule 2</b>) to manufacture a new, empty anonymous array of cities, and
    installs a reference to it into the hash under the appropriate key.</p>
<p class="Pp">Line 6 installs the city name into the appropriate array.
    <span class="Li">$table{$country}</span> now holds a reference to the array
    of cities seen in that country so far. Line 6 is exactly like</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        push @array, $city;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">except that the name <span class="Li">&quot;array&quot;</span> has
    been replaced by the reference
    <span class="Li">&quot;{$table{$country}}&quot;</span>. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;push&quot;</span> adds a city name to the end of the
    referred-to array.</p>
<p class="Pp">There's one fine point I skipped. Line 5 is unnecessary, and we
    can get rid of it.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    2   while (&lt;&gt;) {
    3     chomp;
    4     my ($city, $country) = split /, /;
    5   ####  $table{$country} = [] unless exists $table{$country};
    6     push @{$table{$country}}, $city;
    7   }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If there's already an entry in <span class="Li">%table</span> for
    the current <span class="Li">$country</span>, then nothing is different.
    Line 6 will locate the value in <span class="Li">$table{$country}</span>,
    which is a reference to an array, and push <span class="Li">$city</span>
    into the array. But what does it do when <span class="Li">$country</span>
    holds a key, say <span class="Li">&quot;Greece&quot;</span>, that is not yet
    in <span class="Li">%table</span>?</p>
<p class="Pp">This is Perl, so it does the exact right thing. It sees that you
    want to push <span class="Li">&quot;Athens&quot;</span> onto an array that
    doesn't exist, so it helpfully makes a new, empty, anonymous array for you,
    installs it into <span class="Li">%table</span>, and then pushes
    <span class="Li">&quot;Athens&quot;</span> onto it. This is called
    <i>autovivification</i>--bringing things to life automatically. Perl saw
    that the key wasn't in the hash, so it created a new hash entry
    automatically. Perl saw that you wanted to use the hash value as an array,
    so it created a new empty array and installed a reference to it in the hash
    automatically. And as usual, Perl made the array one element longer to hold
    the new city name.</p>

      other references.</li>
  <li>In <b>Use Rule 1</b>, you can omit the curly brackets whenever the thing
      inside them is an atomic scalar variable like
      <span class="Li">$aref</span>. For example, <span class="Li">@$aref</span>
      is the same as <span class="Li">&quot;@{$aref}&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">$$aref[1]</span> is the same as
      <span class="Li">&quot;${$aref}[1]&quot;</span>. If you're just starting
      out, you may want to adopt the habit of always including the curly
      brackets.</li>
  <li>This doesn't copy the underlying array:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        $aref2 = $aref1;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You get two references to the same array. If you modify
        <span class="Li">&quot;$aref1-&gt;[23]&quot;</span> and then look at
        <span class="Li">&quot;$aref2-&gt;[23]&quot;</span> you'll see the
        change.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To copy the array, use</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        $aref2 = [@{$aref1}];
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This uses <span class="Li">&quot;[...]&quot;</span> notation
        to create a new anonymous array, and <span class="Li">$aref2</span> is
        assigned a reference to the new array. The new array is initialized with
        the contents of the array referred to by
      <span class="Li">$aref1</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Similarly, to copy an anonymous hash, you can use</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        $href2 = {%{$href1}};
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>To see if a variable contains a reference, use the
      <span class="Li">&quot;ref&quot;</span> function. It returns true if its
      argument is a reference. Actually it's a little better than that: It
      returns <span class="Li">&quot;HASH&quot;</span> for hash references and
      <span class="Li">&quot;ARRAY&quot;</span> for array references.</li>
  <li>If you try to use a reference like a string, you get strings like
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        ARRAY(0x80f5dec)   or    HASH(0x826afc0)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you ever see a string that looks like this, you'll know you
        printed out a reference by mistake.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A side effect of this representation is that you can use
        <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> to see if two references refer to
        the same thing. (But you should usually use
        <span class="Li">&quot;==&quot;</span> instead because it's much
        faster.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>You can use a string as if it were a reference. If you use the string
      <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span> as an array reference, it's taken
      to be a reference to the array <span class="Li">@foo</span>. This is
      called a <i>symbolic reference</i>. The declaration
      <span class="Li">&quot;use strict 'refs'&quot;</span> disables this
      feature, which can cause all sorts of trouble if you use it by
    accident.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">You might prefer to go on to perllol instead of perlref; it
    discusses lists of lists and multidimensional arrays in detail. After that,
    you should move on to perldsc; it's a Data Structure Cookbook that shows
    recipes for using and printing out arrays of hashes, hashes of arrays, and
    other kinds of data.</p>

<p class="Pp">Everyone needs compound data structures, and in Perl the way you
    get them is with references. There are four important rules for managing
    references: Two for making references and two for using them. Once you know
    these rules you can do most of the important things you need to do with
    references.</p>
