<p class="Pp">Shows the commit logs.</p>
<p class="Pp">List commits that are reachable by following the <b>parent</b>
    links from the given commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable from
    the one(s) given with a <i>^</i> in front of them. The output is given in
    reverse chronological order by default.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can think of this as a set operation. Commits reachable from
    any of the commits given on the command line form a set, and then commits
    reachable from any of the ones given with <i>^</i> in front are subtracted
    from that set. The remaining commits are what comes out in the
    command&#x2019;s output. Various other options and paths parameters can be
    used to further limit the result.</p>
<p class="Pp">Thus, the following command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git log foo bar ^baz
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">means &quot;list all the commits which are reachable from
    <i>foo</i> or <i>bar</i>, but not from <i>baz</i>&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">A special notation
    &quot;<i>&lt;commit1&gt;</i>..<i>&lt;commit2&gt;</i>&quot; can be used as a
    short-hand for &quot;^<i>&lt;commit1&gt;</i> <i>&lt;commit2&gt;</i>&quot;.
    For example, either of the following may be used interchangeably:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git log origin..HEAD
$ git log HEAD ^origin
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Another special notation is
    &quot;<i>&lt;commit1&gt;</i>...<i>&lt;commit2&gt;</i>&quot; which is useful
    for merges. The resulting set of commits is the symmetric difference between
    the two operands. The following two commands are equivalent:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git log A B --not $(git merge-base --all A B)
$ git log A...B
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The command takes options applicable to the <b>git-rev-list</b>(1)
    command to control what is shown and how, and options applicable to the
    <b>git-diff</b>(1) command to control how the changes each commit introduces
    are shown.</p>

  (works only for a single file).</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-decorate, --decorate[=short|full|auto|no]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown. If
  <i>short</i> is specified, the ref name prefixes <i>refs/heads/</i>,
  <i>refs/tags/</i> and <i>refs/remotes/</i> will not be printed. If <i>full</i>
  is specified, the full ref name (including prefix) will be printed. If
  <i>auto</i> is specified, then if the output is going to a terminal, the ref
  names are shown as if <i>short</i> were given, otherwise no ref names are
  shown. The default option is <i>short</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--decorate-refs=&lt;pattern&gt;,
    --decorate-refs-exclude=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If no <b>--decorate-refs</b> is given, pretend as if all
  refs were included. For each candidate, do not use it for decoration if it
  matches any patterns given to <b>--decorate-refs-exclude</b> or if it
  doesn&#x2019;t match any of the patterns given to <b>--decorate-refs</b>. The
  <b>log.excludeDecoration</b> config option allows excluding refs from the
  decorations, but an explicit <b>--decorate-refs</b> pattern will override a
  match in <b>log.excludeDecoration</b>.</div>

<div class="Bd-indent">Print out the ref name given on the command line by which
  each commit was reached.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]mailmap, --[no-]use-mailmap</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use mailmap file to map author and committer names and
  email addresses to canonical real names and email addresses. See
  <b>git-shortlog</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--full-diff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Without this flag, <b>git log -p &lt;path&gt;...</b>
  shows commits that touch the specified paths, and diffs about the same
  specified paths. With this, the full diff is shown for commits that touch the
  specified paths; this means that &quot;&lt;path&gt;...&quot; limits only
  commits, and doesn&#x2019;t limit diff for those commits.
<p class="Pp">Note that this affects all diff-based output types, e.g. those
    produced by <b>--stat</b>, etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--log-size</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Include a line &#x201C;log size &lt;number&gt;&#x201D; in
  the output for each commit, where &lt;number&gt; is the length of that
  commit&#x2019;s message in bytes. Intended to speed up tools that read log
  messages from <b>git log</b> output by allowing them to allocate space in
  advance.</div>
<p class="Pp">-L&lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;:&lt;file&gt;,
    -L:&lt;funcname&gt;:&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Trace the evolution of the line range given by
  <i>&lt;start&gt;,&lt;end&gt;</i>, or by the function name regex
  <i>&lt;funcname&gt;</i>, within the <i>&lt;file&gt;</i>. You may not give any
  pathspec limiters. This is currently limited to a walk starting from a single
  revision, i.e., you may only give zero or one positive revision arguments, and
  <i>&lt;start&gt;</i> and <i>&lt;end&gt;</i> (or <i>&lt;funcname&gt;</i>) must
  exist in the starting revision. You can specify this option more than once.
  Implies <b>--patch</b>. Patch output can be suppressed using
  <b>--no-patch</b>, but other diff formats (namely <b>--raw</b>,
  <b>--numstat</b>, <b>--shortstat</b>, <b>--dirstat</b>, <b>--summary</b>,
  <b>--name-only</b>, <b>--name-status</b>, <b>--check</b>) are not currently
  implemented.
<p class="Pp"><i>&lt;start&gt;</i> and <i>&lt;end&gt;</i> can take one of these
    forms:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;number
<p class="Pp">If <i>&lt;start&gt;</i> or <i>&lt;end&gt;</i> is a number, it
    specifies an absolute line number (lines count from 1).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>/regex/</b>
<p class="Pp">This form will use the first line matching the given POSIX regex.
    If <i>&lt;start&gt;</i> is a regex, it will search from the end of the
    previous <b>-L</b> range, if any, otherwise from the start of file. If
    <i>&lt;start&gt;</i> is <b>^/regex/</b>, it will search from the start of
    file. If <i>&lt;end&gt;</i> is a regex, it will search starting at the line
    given by <i>&lt;start&gt;</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;+offset or -offset
<p class="Pp">This is only valid for <i>&lt;end&gt;</i> and will specify a
    number of lines before or after the line given by <i>&lt;start&gt;</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If <b>:&lt;funcname&gt;</b> is given in place of
    <i>&lt;start&gt;</i> and <i>&lt;end&gt;</i>, it is a regular expression that
    denotes the range from the first funcname line that matches
    <i>&lt;funcname&gt;</i>, up to the next funcname line.
    <b>:&lt;funcname&gt;</b> searches from the end of the previous <b>-L</b>
    range, if any, otherwise from the start of file. <b>^:&lt;funcname&gt;</b>
    searches from the start of file. The function names are determined in the
    same way as <b>git diff</b> works out patch hunk headers (see <i>Defining a
    custom hunk-header</i> in <b>gitattributes</b>(5)).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;revision range&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show only commits in the specified revision range. When
  no &lt;revision range&gt; is specified, it defaults to <b>HEAD</b> (i.e. the
  whole history leading to the current commit). <b>origin..HEAD</b> specifies
  all the commits reachable from the current commit (i.e. <b>HEAD</b>), but not
  from <b>origin</b>. For a complete list of ways to spell &lt;revision
  range&gt;, see the <i>Specifying Ranges</i> section of
  <b>gitrevisions</b>(7).</div>
<p class="Pp">[--] &lt;path&gt;...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show only commits that are enough to explain how the
  files that match the specified paths came to be. See <i>History
  Simplification</i> below for details and other simplification modes.
<p class="Pp">Paths may need to be prefixed with <b>--</b> to separate them from
    options or the revision range, when confusion arises.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Commit_Limiting"><a class="permalink" href="#Commit_Limiting">Commit
  Limiting</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using
    the special notations explained in the description, additional commit
    limiting may be applied.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using more options generally further limits the output (e.g.
    <b>--since=&lt;date1&gt;</b> limits to commits newer than
    <b>&lt;date1&gt;</b>, and using it with <b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>
    further limits to commits whose log message has a line that matches
    <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>), unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting
    options, such as <b>--reverse</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">-&lt;number&gt;, -n &lt;number&gt;, --max-count=&lt;number&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the number of commits to output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--skip=&lt;number&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Skip <i>number</i> commits before starting to show the
  commit output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--since=&lt;date&gt;, --after=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show commits more recent than a specific date.</div>
<p class="Pp">--until=&lt;date&gt;, --before=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show commits older than a specific date.</div>
<p class="Pp">--author=&lt;pattern&gt;, --committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer
  header lines that match the specified pattern (regular expression). With more
  than one <b>--author=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>, commits whose author matches any of
  the given patterns are chosen (similarly for multiple
  <b>--committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>).</div>
<p class="Pp">--grep-reflog=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that
  match the specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
  <b>--grep-reflog</b>, commits whose reflog message matches any of the given
  patterns are chosen. It is an error to use this option unless
  <b>--walk-reflogs</b> is in use.</div>
<p class="Pp">--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the commits output to ones with log message that
  matches the specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
  <b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>, commits whose message matches any of the given
  patterns are chosen (but see <b>--all-match</b>).
<p class="Pp">When <b>--notes</b> is in effect, the message from the notes is
    matched as if it were part of the log message.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--all-match</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the commits output to ones that match all given
  <b>--grep</b>, instead of ones that match at least one.</div>
<p class="Pp">--invert-grep</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the commits output to ones with log message that do
  not match the pattern specified with <b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-i, --regexp-ignore-case</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Match the regular expression limiting patterns without
  regard to letter case.</div>
<p class="Pp">--basic-regexp</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Consider the limiting patterns to be basic regular
  expressions; this is the default.</div>
<p class="Pp">-E, --extended-regexp</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular
  expressions instead of the default basic regular expressions.</div>
<p class="Pp">-F, --fixed-strings</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings
  (don&#x2019;t interpret pattern as a regular expression).</div>
<p class="Pp">-P, --perl-regexp</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Consider the limiting patterns to be Perl-compatible
  regular expressions.
<p class="Pp">Support for these types of regular expressions is an optional
    compile-time dependency. If Git wasn&#x2019;t compiled with support for them
    providing this option will cause it to die.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--remove-empty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Stop when a given path disappears from the tree.</div>
<p class="Pp">--merges</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print only merge commits. This is exactly the same as
  <b>--min-parents=2</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-merges</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not print commits with more than one parent. This is
  exactly the same as <b>--max-parents=1</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--min-parents=&lt;number&gt;, --max-parents=&lt;number&gt;,
    --no-min-parents, --no-max-parents</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that
  many parent commits. In particular, <b>--max-parents=1</b> is the same as
  <b>--no-merges</b>, <b>--min-parents=2</b> is the same as <b>--merges</b>.
  <b>--max-parents=0</b> gives all root commits and <b>--min-parents=3</b> all
  octopus merges.
<p class="Pp"><b>--no-min-parents</b> and <b>--no-max-parents</b> reset these
    limits (to no limit) again. Equivalent forms are <b>--min-parents=0</b> (any
    commit has 0 or more parents) and <b>--max-parents=-1</b> (negative numbers
    denote no upper limit).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--first-parent</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge
  commit. This option can give a better overview when viewing the evolution of a
  particular topic branch, because merges into a topic branch tend to be only
  about adjusting to updated upstream from time to time, and this option allows
  you to ignore the individual commits brought in to your history by such a
  merge.
<p class="Pp">This option also changes default diff format for merge commits to
    <b>first-parent</b>, see <b>--diff-merges=first-parent</b> for details.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--not</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Reverses the meaning of the <i>^</i> prefix (or lack
  thereof) for all following revision specifiers, up to the next
  <b>--not</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--all</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/</b>, along with
  <b>HEAD</b>, are listed on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--branches[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/heads</b> are
  listed on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i>
  is given, limit branches to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks
  <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end is implied.</div>
<p class="Pp">--tags[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/tags</b> are listed
  on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> is
  given, limit tags to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks
  <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end is implied.</div>
<p class="Pp">--remotes[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/remotes</b> are
  listed on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i>
  is given, limit remote-tracking branches to ones matching given shell glob. If
  pattern lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end is

<p class="Pp">--glob=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all the refs matching shell glob
  <i>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</i> are listed on the command line as
  <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. Leading <i>refs/</i>, is automatically prepended if

<p class="Pp">--exclude=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not include refs matching <i>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</i>
  that the next <b>--all</b>, <b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>,
  <b>--remotes</b>, or <b>--glob</b> would otherwise consider. Repetitions of
  this option accumulate exclusion patterns up to the next <b>--all</b>,
  <b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>, <b>--remotes</b>, or <b>--glob</b> option
  (other options or arguments do not clear accumulated patterns).
<p class="Pp">The patterns given should not begin with <b>refs/heads</b>,
    <b>refs/tags</b>, or <b>refs/remotes</b> when applied to <b>--branches</b>,
    <b>--tags</b>, or <b>--remotes</b>, respectively, and they must begin with
    <b>refs/</b> when applied to <b>--glob</b> or <b>--all</b>. If a trailing
    <i>/*</i> is intended, it must be given explicitly.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--reflog</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all objects mentioned by reflogs are listed
  on the command line as <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--alternate-refs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all objects mentioned as ref tips of
  alternate repositories were listed on the command line. An alternate
  repository is any repository whose object directory is specified in
  <b>objects/info/alternates</b>. The set of included objects may be modified by
  <b>core.alternateRefsCommand</b>, etc. See <b>git-config</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--single-worktree</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, all working trees will be examined by the
  following options when there are more than one (see <b>git-worktree</b>(1)):
  <b>--all</b>, <b>--reflog</b> and <b>--indexed-objects</b>. This option forces
  them to examine the current working tree only.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-missing</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Upon seeing an invalid object name in the input, pretend
  as if the bad input was not given.</div>
<p class="Pp">--bisect</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if the bad bisection ref
  <b>refs/bisect/bad</b> was listed and as if it was followed by <b>--not</b>
  and the good bisection refs <b>refs/bisect/good-*</b> on the command
  line.</div>
<p class="Pp">--stdin</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to the <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i> listed on the
  command line, read them from the standard input. If a <b>--</b> separator is
  seen, stop reading commits and start reading paths to limit the result.</div>
<p class="Pp">--cherry-mark</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Like <b>--cherry-pick</b> (see below) but mark equivalent
  commits with <b>=</b> rather than omitting them, and inequivalent ones with
  <b>+</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--cherry-pick</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Omit any commit that introduces the same change as
  another commit on the &#x201C;other side&#x201D; when the set of commits are
  limited with symmetric difference.
<p class="Pp">For example, if you have two branches, <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, a
    usual way to list all commits on only one side of them is with
    <b>--left-right</b> (see the example below in the description of the
    <b>--left-right</b> option). However, it shows the commits that were
    cherry-picked from the other branch (for example, &#x201C;3rd on b&#x201D;
    may be cherry-picked from branch A). With this option, such pairs of commits
    are excluded from the output.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--left-only, --right-only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric
  difference, i.e. only those which would be marked <b>&lt;</b> resp.
  <b>&gt;</b> by <b>--left-right</b>.
<p class="Pp">For example, <b>--cherry-pick --right-only A...B</b> omits those
    commits from <b>B</b> which are in <b>A</b> or are patch-equivalent to a
    commit in <b>A</b>. In other words, this lists the <b>+</b> commits from
    <b>git cherry A B</b>. More precisely, <b>--cherry-pick --right-only
    --no-merges</b> gives the exact list.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--cherry</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A synonym for <b>--right-only --cherry-mark
  --no-merges</b>; useful to limit the output to the commits on our side and
  mark those that have been applied to the other side of a forked history with
  <b>git log --cherry upstream...mybranch</b>, similar to <b>git cherry upstream
  mybranch</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-g, --walk-reflogs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog
  entries from the most recent one to older ones. When this option is used you
  cannot specify commits to exclude (that is, <i>^commit</i>,
  <i>commit1..commit2</i>, and <i>commit1...commit2</i> notations cannot be
  used).
<p class="Pp">With <b>--pretty</b> format other than <b>oneline</b> and
    <b>reference</b> (for obvious reasons), this causes the output to have two
    extra lines of information taken from the reflog. The reflog designator in
    the output may be shown as <b>ref@{Nth}</b> (where <b>Nth</b> is the
    reverse-chronological index in the reflog) or as <b>ref@{timestamp}</b>
    (with the timestamp for that entry), depending on a few rules:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.If the starting point is specified as
  <b>ref@{Nth}</b>, show the index format.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.If the starting point was specified as
  <b>ref@{now}</b>, show the timestamp format.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.If neither was used, but <b>--date</b> was given on
  the command line, show the timestamp in the format requested by
  <b>--date</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.Otherwise, show the index format.</div>
<p class="Pp">Under <b>--pretty=oneline</b>, the commit message is prefixed with
    this information on the same line. This option cannot be combined with
    <b>--reverse</b>. See also <b>git-reflog</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">Under <b>--pretty=reference</b>, this information will not be
    shown at all.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--merge</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">After a failed merge, show refs that touch files having a
  conflict and don&#x2019;t exist on all heads to merge.</div>
<p class="Pp">--boundary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output excluded boundary commits. Boundary commits are
  prefixed with <b>-</b>.</div>

  Simplification</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for
    example the commits modifying a particular &lt;path&gt;. But there are two
    parts of <i>History Simplification</i>, one part is selecting the commits
    and the other is how to do it, as there are various strategies to simplify
    the history.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following options select the commits to be shown:</p>
<p class="Pp">&lt;paths&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commits modifying the given &lt;paths&gt; are
  selected.</div>
<p class="Pp">--simplify-by-decoration</p>

<p class="Pp">The horizontal line of history A---Q is taken to be the first

<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>D</b> sets <b>foo</b> to &#x201C;baz&#x201D;.

<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>E</b> changes <b>quux</b> to

<p class="Pp"><b>rev-list</b> walks backwards through history, including or
    excluding commits based on whether <b>--full-history</b> and/or parent
    rewriting (via <b>--parents</b> or <b>--children</b>) are used. The
    following settings are available.</p>
<p class="Pp">Default mode</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any
  parent (though this can be changed, see <b>--sparse</b> below). If the commit
  was a merge, and it was TREESAME to one parent, follow only that parent. (Even
  if there are several TREESAME parents, follow only one of them.) Otherwise,
  follow all parents.
<p class="Pp">This results in:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

<br/>

<br/>
        I---------D
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is
    available, removed <b>B</b> from consideration entirely. <b>C</b> was
    considered via <b>N</b>, but is TREESAME. Root commits are compared to an
    empty tree, so <b>I</b> is !TREESAME.</p>
<p class="Pp">Parent/child relations are only visible with <b>--parents</b>, but
    that does not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we have shown
    the parent lines.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--full-history without parent rewriting</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This mode differs from the default in one point: always
  follow all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them. Even if
  more than one side of the merge has commits that are included, this does not
  imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we get
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
        I  A  B  N  D  O  P  Q
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>M</b> was excluded because it is TREESAME to both parents.
    <b>E</b>, <b>C</b> and <b>B</b> were all walked, but only <b>B</b> was
    !TREESAME, so the others do not appear.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to
    talk about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so we show
    them disconnected.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--full-history with parent rewriting</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME
  (though this can be changed, see <b>--sparse</b> below).
<p class="Pp">Merges are always included. However, their parent list is
    rewritten: Along each parent, prune away commits that are not included
    themselves. This results in</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Compare to <b>--full-history</b> without rewriting above. Note
    that <b>E</b> was pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the parent list of
    P was rewritten to contain <b>E</b>'s parent <b>I</b>. The same happened for
    <b>C</b> and <b>N</b>, and <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b> and <b>Q</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME
    affects inclusion:</p>
<p class="Pp">--dense</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commits that are walked are included if they are not
  TREESAME to any parent.</div>
<p class="Pp">--sparse</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">All commits that are walked are included.
<p class="Pp">Note that without <b>--full-history</b>, this still simplifies
    merges: if one of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one, so the
    other sides of the merge are never walked.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--simplify-merges</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">First, build a history graph in the same way that
  <b>--full-history</b> with parent rewriting does (see above).
<p class="Pp">Then simplify each commit <b>C</b> to its replacement <b>C'</b> in
    the final history according to the following rules:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Set <b>C'</b> to <b>C</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Replace each parent <b>P</b> of <b>C'</b> with
  its simplification <b>P'</b>. In the process, drop parents that are ancestors
  of other parents or that are root commits TREESAME to an empty tree, and
  remove duplicates, but take care to never drop all parents that we are
  TREESAME to.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If after this parent rewriting, <b>C'</b> is a
  root or merge commit (has zero or &gt;1 parents), a boundary commit, or
  !TREESAME, it remains. Otherwise, it is replaced with its only parent.</div>
<p class="Pp">The effect of this is best shown by way of comparing to
    <b>--full-history</b> with parent rewriting. The example turns into:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
          .-A---M---N---O
<br/>
         /     /       /

<br/>
         \   /       /
<br/>
          `---------'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note the major differences in <b>N</b>, <b>P</b>, and <b>Q</b>
    over <b>--full-history</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>N</b>'s parent list had <b>I</b> removed,
  because it is an ancestor of the other parent <b>M</b>. Still, <b>N</b>
  remained because it is !TREESAME.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>P</b>'s parent list similarly had <b>I</b>
  removed. <b>P</b> was then removed completely, because it had one parent and
  is TREESAME.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>Q</b>'s parent list had <b>Y</b> simplified to
  <b>X</b>. <b>X</b> was then removed, because it was a TREESAME root. <b>Q</b>
  was then removed completely, because it had one parent and is TREESAME.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">There is another simplification mode available:</p>
<p class="Pp">--ancestry-path</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the displayed commits to those directly on the
  ancestry chain between the &#x201C;from&#x201D; and &#x201C;to&#x201D; commits
  in the given commit range. I.e. only display commits that are ancestor of the
  &#x201C;to&#x201D; commit and descendants of the &#x201C;from&#x201D; commit.
<p class="Pp">As an example use case, consider the following commit history:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
            D---E-------F
<br/>
           /     \       \
<br/>
          B---C---G---H---I---J
<br/>
         /                     \
<br/>
        A-------K---------------L--M
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">A regular <i>D..M</i> computes the set of commits that are
    ancestors of <b>M</b>, but excludes the ones that are ancestors of <b>D</b>.
    This is useful to see what happened to the history leading to <b>M</b> since
    <b>D</b>, in the sense that &#x201C;what does <b>M</b> have that did not
    exist in <b>D</b>&#x201D;. The result in this example would be all the
    commits, except <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> (and <b>D</b> itself, of course).</p>
<p class="Pp">When we want to find out what commits in <b>M</b> are contaminated
    with the bug introduced by <b>D</b> and need fixing, however, we might want
    to view only the subset of <i>D..M</i> that are actually descendants of
    <b>D</b>, i.e. excluding <b>C</b> and <b>K</b>. This is exactly what the
    <b>--ancestry-path</b> option does. Applied to the <i>D..M</i> range, it
    results in:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
                E-------F
<br/>
                 \       \

</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Before discussing another option, <b>--show-pulls</b>, we need to
    create a new example history.</p>
<p class="Pp">A common problem users face when looking at simplified history is
    that a commit they know changed a file somehow does not appear in the
    file&#x2019;s simplified history. Let&#x2019;s demonstrate a new example and
    show how options such as <b>--full-history</b> and <b>--simplify-merges</b>
    works in that case:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
          .-A---M-----C--N---O---P
<br/>
         /     / \  \  \/   /   /
<br/>
        I     B   \  R-'`-Z'   /
<br/>
         \   /     \/         /
<br/>
          \ /      /\        /
<br/>
           `---X--'  `---Y--'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">For this example, suppose <b>I</b> created <b>file.txt</b> which
    was modified by <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>X</b> in different ways. The
    single-parent commits <b>C</b>, <b>Z</b>, and <b>Y</b> do not change
    <b>file.txt</b>. The merge commit <b>M</b> was created by resolving the
    merge conflict to include both changes from <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> and hence
    is not TREESAME to either. The merge commit <b>R</b>, however, was created
    by ignoring the contents of <b>file.txt</b> at <b>M</b> and taking only the
    contents of <b>file.txt</b> at <b>X</b>. Hence, <b>R</b> is TREESAME to
    <b>X</b> but not <b>M</b>. Finally, the natural merge resolution to create
    <b>N</b> is to take the contents of <b>file.txt</b> at <b>R</b>, so <b>N</b>
    is TREESAME to <b>R</b> but not <b>C</b>. The merge commits <b>O</b> and
    <b>P</b> are TREESAME to their first parents, but not to their second
    parents, <b>Z</b> and <b>Y</b> respectively.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using the default mode, <b>N</b> and <b>R</b> both have a
    TREESAME parent, so those edges are walked and the others are ignored. The
    resulting history graph is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
        I---X
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">When using <b>--full-history</b>, Git walks every edge. This will
    discover the commits <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> and the merge <b>M</b>, but also
    will reveal the merge commits <b>O</b> and <b>P</b>. With parent rewriting,
    the resulting graph is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
          .-A---M--------N---O---P
<br/>
         /     / \  \  \/   /   /
<br/>
        I     B   \  R-'`--'   /
<br/>
         \   /     \/         /
<br/>
          \ /      /\        /
<br/>
           `---X--'  `------'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Here, the merge commits <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> contribute extra
    noise, as they did not actually contribute a change to <b>file.txt</b>. They
    only merged a topic that was based on an older version of <b>file.txt</b>.
    This is a common issue in repositories using a workflow where many
    contributors work in parallel and merge their topic branches along a single
    trunk: manu unrelated merges appear in the <b>--full-history</b>
  results.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using the <b>--simplify-merges</b> option, the commits
    <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> disappear from the results. This is because the
    rewritten second parents of <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> are reachable from their
    first parents. Those edges are removed and then the commits look like
    single-parent commits that are TREESAME to their parent. This also happens
    to the commit <b>N</b>, resulting in a history view as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
          .-A---M--.
<br/>
         /     /    \
<br/>
        I     B      R
<br/>
         \   /      /
<br/>
          \ /      /
<br/>
           `---X--'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">In this view, we see all of the important single-parent changes
    from <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>X</b>. We also see the carefully-resolved
    merge <b>M</b> and the not-so-carefully-resolved merge <b>R</b>. This is
    usually enough information to determine why the commits <b>A</b> and
    <b>B</b> &quot;disappeared&quot; from history in the default view. However,
    there are a few issues with this approach.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first issue is performance. Unlike any previous option, the
    <b>--simplify-merges</b> option requires walking the entire commit history
    before returning a single result. This can make the option difficult to use
    for very large repositories.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second issue is one of auditing. When many contributors are
    working on the same repository, it is important which merge commits
    introduced a change into an important branch. The problematic merge <b>R</b>
    above is not likely to be the merge commit that was used to merge into an
    important branch. Instead, the merge <b>N</b> was used to merge <b>R</b> and
    <b>X</b> into the important branch. This commit may have information about
    why the change <b>X</b> came to override the changes from <b>A</b> and
    <b>B</b> in its commit message.</p>
<p class="Pp">--show-pulls</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to the commits shown in the default history,
  show each merge commit that is not TREESAME to its first parent but is
  TREESAME to a later parent.
<p class="Pp">When a merge commit is included by <b>--show-pulls</b>, the merge
    is treated as if it &quot;pulled&quot; the change from another branch. When
    using <b>--show-pulls</b> on this example (and no other options) the
    resulting graph is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
        I---X---R---N
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Here, the merge commits <b>R</b> and <b>N</b> are included because
    they pulled the commits <b>X</b> and <b>R</b> into the base branch,
    respectively. These merges are the reason the commits <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>
    do not appear in the default history.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>--show-pulls</b> is paired with <b>--simplify-merges</b>,
    the graph includes all of the necessary information:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
          .-A---M--.   N
<br/>
         /     /    \ /
<br/>
        I     B      R
<br/>
         \   /      /
<br/>
          \ /      /
<br/>
           `---X--'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Notice that since <b>M</b> is reachable from <b>R</b>, the edge
    from <b>N</b> to <b>M</b> was simplified away. However, <b>N</b> still
    appears in the history as an important commit because it &quot;pulled&quot;
    the change <b>R</b> into the main branch.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <b>--simplify-by-decoration</b> option allows you to view only
    the big picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits that are
    not referenced by tags. Commits are marked as !TREESAME (in other words,
    kept after history simplification rules described above) if (1) they are
    referenced by tags, or (2) they change the contents of the paths given on
    the command line. All other commits are marked as TREESAME (subject to be
    simplified away).</p>

  <i>short</i>, <i>medium</i>, <i>full</i>, <i>fuller</i>, <i>reference</i>,
  <i>email</i>, <i>raw</i>, <i>format:&lt;string&gt;</i> and
  <i>tformat:&lt;string&gt;</i>. When <i>&lt;format&gt;</i> is none of the
  above, and has <i>%placeholder</i> in it, it acts as if
  <i>--pretty=tformat:&lt;format&gt;</i> were given.
<p class="Pp">See the &quot;PRETTY FORMATS&quot; section for some additional
    details for each format. When <i>=&lt;format&gt;</i> part is omitted, it
    defaults to <i>medium</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository
    configuration (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--abbrev-commit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit
  object name, show a prefix that names the object uniquely.
  &quot;--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;&quot; (which also modifies diff output, if it is
  displayed) option can be used to specify the minimum length of the prefix.
<p class="Pp">This should make &quot;--pretty=oneline&quot; a whole lot more
    readable for people using 80-column terminals.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-abbrev-commit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name.
  This negates <b>--abbrev-commit</b>, either explicit or implied by other
  options such as &quot;--oneline&quot;. It also overrides the
  <b>log.abbrevCommit</b> variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">--oneline</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is a shorthand for &quot;--pretty=oneline
  --abbrev-commit&quot; used together.</div>
<p class="Pp">--encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The commit objects record the encoding used for the log
  message in their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the command
  to re-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by the user. For
  non plumbing commands this defaults to UTF-8. Note that if an object claims to
  be encoded in <b>X</b> and we are outputting in <b>X</b>, we will output the
  object verbatim; this means that invalid sequences in the original commit may
  be copied to the output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--expand-tabs=&lt;n&gt;, --expand-tabs, --no-expand-tabs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Perform a tab expansion (replace each tab with enough
  spaces to fill to the next display column that is multiple of
  <i>&lt;n&gt;</i>) in the log message before showing it in the output.
  <b>--expand-tabs</b> is a short-hand for <b>--expand-tabs=8</b>, and
  <b>--no-expand-tabs</b> is a short-hand for <b>--expand-tabs=0</b>, which
  disables tab expansion.
<p class="Pp">By default, tabs are expanded in pretty formats that indent the
    log message by 4 spaces (i.e. <i>medium</i>, which is the default,
    <i>full</i>, and <i>fuller</i>).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--notes[=&lt;ref&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the notes (see <b>git-notes</b>(1)) that annotate
  the commit, when showing the commit log message. This is the default for
  <b>git log</b>, <b>git show</b> and <b>git whatchanged</b> commands when there
  is no <b>--pretty</b>, <b>--format</b>, or <b>--oneline</b> option given on
  the command line.
<p class="Pp">By default, the notes shown are from the notes refs listed in the
    <b>core.notesRef</b> and <b>notes.displayRef</b> variables (or corresponding
    environment overrides). See <b>git-config</b>(1) for more details.</p>
<p class="Pp">With an optional <i>&lt;ref&gt;</i> argument, use the ref to find
    the notes to display. The ref can specify the full refname when it begins
    with <b>refs/notes/</b>; when it begins with <b>notes/</b>, <b>refs/</b> and
    otherwise <b>refs/notes/</b> is prefixed to form a full name of the ref.</p>
<p class="Pp">Multiple --notes options can be combined to control which notes
    are being displayed. Examples: &quot;--notes=foo&quot; will show only notes
    from &quot;refs/notes/foo&quot;; &quot;--notes=foo --notes&quot; will show
    both notes from &quot;refs/notes/foo&quot; and from the default notes
    ref(s).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-notes</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not show notes. This negates the above <b>--notes</b>
  option, by resetting the list of notes refs from which notes are shown.
  Options are parsed in the order given on the command line, so e.g.
  &quot;--notes --notes=foo --no-notes --notes=bar&quot; will only show notes
  from &quot;refs/notes/bar&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">--show-notes[=&lt;ref&gt;], --[no-]standard-notes</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">These options are deprecated. Use the above
  --notes/--no-notes options instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">--show-signature</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Check the validity of a signed commit object by passing
  the signature to <b>gpg --verify</b> and show the output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--relative-date</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for <b>--date=relative</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--date=&lt;format&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only takes effect for dates shown in human-readable
  format, such as when using <b>--pretty</b>. <b>log.date</b> config variable
  sets a default value for the log command&#x2019;s <b>--date</b> option. By
  default, dates are shown in the original time zone (either committer&#x2019;s
  or author&#x2019;s). If <b>-local</b> is appended to the format (e.g.,
  <b>iso-local</b>), the user&#x2019;s local time zone is used instead.
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=relative</b> shows dates relative to the current time,
    e.g. &#x201C;2 hours ago&#x201D;. The <b>-local</b> option has no effect for
    <b>--date=relative</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=local</b> is an alias for
  <b>--date=default-local</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=iso</b> (or <b>--date=iso8601</b>) shows timestamps in a
    ISO 8601-like format. The differences to the strict ISO 8601 format are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;a space instead of the <b>T</b> date/time
  delimiter</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;a space between time and time zone</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;no colon between hours and minutes of the time
  zone</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=iso-strict</b> (or <b>--date=iso8601-strict</b>) shows
    timestamps in strict ISO 8601 format.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=rfc</b> (or <b>--date=rfc2822</b>) shows timestamps in
    RFC 2822 format, often found in email messages.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=short</b> shows only the date, but not the time, in
    <b>YYYY-MM-DD</b> format.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=raw</b> shows the date as seconds since the epoch
    (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), followed by a space, and then the timezone as an
    offset from UTC (a <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> with four digits; the first two are
    hours, and the second two are minutes). I.e., as if the timestamp were
    formatted with <b>strftime(&quot;%s %z&quot;)</b>). Note that the
    <b>-local</b> option does not affect the seconds-since-epoch value (which is
    always measured in UTC), but does switch the accompanying timezone
  value.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=human</b> shows the timezone if the timezone does not
    match the current time-zone, and doesn&#x2019;t print the whole date if that
    matches (ie skip printing year for dates that are &quot;this year&quot;, but
    also skip the whole date itself if it&#x2019;s in the last few days and we
    can just say what weekday it was). For older dates the hour and minute is
    also omitted.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=unix</b> shows the date as a Unix epoch timestamp
    (seconds since 1970). As with <b>--raw</b>, this is always in UTC and
    therefore <b>-local</b> has no effect.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=format:...</b> feeds the format <b>...</b> to your
    system <b>strftime</b>, except for %z and %Z, which are handled internally.
    Use <b>--date=format:%c</b> to show the date in your system locale&#x2019;s
    preferred format. See the <b>strftime</b> manual for a complete list of
    format placeholders. When using <b>-local</b>, the correct syntax is
    <b>--date=format-local:...</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--date=default</b> is the default format, and is similar to
    <b>--date=rfc2822</b>, with a few exceptions:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;there is no comma after the day-of-week</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the time zone is omitted when the local time zone
  is used</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--parents</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print also the parents of the commit (in the form
  &quot;commit parent...&quot;). Also enables parent rewriting, see <i>History
  Simplification</i> above.</div>
<p class="Pp">--children</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print also the children of the commit (in the form
  &quot;commit child...&quot;). Also enables parent rewriting, see <i>History
  Simplification</i> above.</div>
<p class="Pp">--left-right</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Mark which side of a symmetric difference a commit is
  reachable from. Commits from the left side are prefixed with <b>&lt;</b> and
  those from the right with <b>&gt;</b>. If combined with <b>--boundary</b>,
  those commits are prefixed with <b>-</b>.
<p class="Pp">For example, if you have this topology:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
             y---b---b  branch B
<br/>
            / \ /
<br/>
           /   .
<br/>
          /   / \
<br/>
         o---x---a---a  branch A
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">you would get an output like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
        $ git rev-list --left-right --boundary --pretty=oneline A...B
<br/>
        &gt;bbbbbbb... 3rd on b
<br/>
        &gt;bbbbbbb... 2nd on b
<br/>
        &lt;aaaaaaa... 3rd on a
<br/>
        &lt;aaaaaaa... 2nd on a
<br/>
        -yyyyyyy... 1st on b
<br/>
        -xxxxxxx... 1st on a
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--graph</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Draw a text-based graphical representation of the commit
  history on the left hand side of the output. This may cause extra lines to be
  printed in between commits, in order for the graph history to be drawn
  properly. Cannot be combined with <b>--no-walk</b>.
<p class="Pp">This enables parent rewriting, see <i>History Simplification</i>
    above.</p>
<p class="Pp">This implies the <b>--topo-order</b> option by default, but the
    <b>--date-order</b> option may also be specified.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--show-linear-break[=&lt;barrier&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When --graph is not used, all history branches are
  flattened which can make it hard to see that the two consecutive commits do
  not belong to a linear branch. This option puts a barrier in between them in
  that case. If <b>&lt;barrier&gt;</b> is specified, it is the string that will
  be shown instead of the default one.</div>
</section>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PRETTY_FORMATS"><a class="permalink" href="#PRETTY_FORMATS">PRETTY
  FORMATS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty-format is not
    <i>oneline</i>, <i>email</i> or <i>raw</i>, an additional line is inserted
    before the <i>Author:</i> line. This line begins with &quot;Merge: &quot;
    and the hashes of ancestral commits are printed, separated by spaces. Note
    that the listed commits may not necessarily be the list of the <b>direct</b>
    parent commits if you have limited your view of history: for example, if you
    are only interested in changes related to a certain directory or file.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are several built-in formats, and you can define additional
    formats by setting a pretty.&lt;name&gt; config option to either another
    format name, or a <i>format:</i> string, as described below (see
    <b>git-config</b>(1)). Here are the details of the built-in formats:</p>

</div>
<p class="Pp">This format is used to refer to another commit in a commit message
    and is the same as <b>--pretty='format:%C(auto)%h (%s, %ad)'</b>. By
    default, the date is formatted with <b>--date=short</b> unless another
    <b>--date</b> option is explicitly specified. As with any <b>format:</b>

<p class="Pp">Like <i>email</i>, but lines in the commit message starting with

    commit.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>raw</i>
<p class="Pp">The <i>raw</i> format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in
    the commit object. Notably, the hashes are displayed in full, regardless of
    whether --abbrev or --no-abbrev are used, and <i>parents</i> information
    show the true parent commits, without taking grafts or history
    simplification into account. Note that this format affects the way commits
    are displayed, but not the way the diff is shown e.g. with <b>git log
    --raw</b>. To get full object names in a raw diff format, use
    <b>--no-abbrev</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>format:&lt;string&gt;</i>
<p class="Pp">The <i>format:&lt;string&gt;</i> format allows you to specify
    which information you want to show. It works a little bit like printf
    format, with the notable exception that you get a newline with <i>%n</i>
    instead of <i>\n</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">E.g, <i>format:&quot;The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was

<div class="Bd-indent">color specification, as described under Values in the

  the former if we are going to a terminal). <b>%C(auto,...)</b> is accepted as
  a historical synonym for the default (e.g., <b>%C(auto,red)</b>). Specifying
  <b>%C(always,...)</b> will show the colors even when color is not otherwise
  enabled (though consider just using <b>--color=always</b> to enable color for
  the whole output, including this format and anything else git might color).
  <b>auto</b> alone (i.e. <b>%C(auto)</b>) will turn on auto coloring on the

<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">Some placeholders may depend on other options given to the
    revision traversal engine. For example, the <b>%g*</b> reflog options will
    insert an empty string unless we are traversing reflog entries (e.g., by
    <b>git log -g</b>). The <b>%d</b> and <b>%D</b> placeholders will use the

    provided on the command line.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If you add a <b>+</b> (plus sign) after <i>%</i> of a placeholder,
    a line-feed is inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the
    placeholder expands to a non-empty string.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you add a <b>-</b> (minus sign) after <i>%</i> of a
    placeholder, all consecutive line-feeds immediately preceding the expansion
    are deleted if and only if the placeholder expands to an empty string.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you add a ` ` (space) after <i>%</i> of a placeholder, a space

<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>tformat:</i>
<p class="Pp">The <i>tformat:</i> format works exactly like <i>format:</i>,
    except that it provides &quot;terminator&quot; semantics instead of
    &quot;separator&quot; semantics. In other words, each commit has the message
    terminator character (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator
    placed between entries. This means that the final entry of a single-line
    format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the
    &quot;oneline&quot; format does. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git log -2 --pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \
<br/>
  | perl -pe '$_ .= &quot; -- NO NEWLINE\n&quot; unless /\n/'

$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef \
<br/>
  | perl -pe '$_ .= &quot; -- NO NEWLINE\n&quot; unless /\n/'
4da45be
7134973
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In addition, any unrecognized string that has a <b>%</b> in it is
    interpreted as if it has <b>tformat:</b> in front of it. For example, these
    two are equivalent:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

  FORMATTING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">By default, <b>git log</b> does not generate any diff output. The
    options below can be used to show the changes made by each commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that unless one of <b>--diff-merges</b> variants (including
    short <b>-m</b>, <b>-c</b>, and <b>--cc</b> options) is explicitly given,
    merge commits will not show a diff, even if a diff format like
    <b>--patch</b> is selected, nor will they match search options like
    <b>-S</b>. The exception is when <b>--first-parent</b> is in use, in which
    case <b>first-parent</b> is the default format.</p>
<p class="Pp">-p, -u, --patch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate patch (see section on generating patches).</div>
<p class="Pp">-s, --no-patch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Suppress diff output. Useful for commands like <b>git
  show</b> that show the patch by default, or to cancel the effect of
  <b>--patch</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-merges=(off|none|on|first-parent|1|separate|m|combined|c|dense-combined|cc),
    --no-diff-merges</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify diff format to be used for merge commits. Default
  is <b>off</b> unless <b>--first-parent</b> is in use, in which case
  <b>first-parent</b> is the default.
<p class="Pp">--diff-merges=(off|none), --no-diff-merges</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disable output of diffs for merge commits. Useful to
  override implied value.</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-merges=on, --diff-merges=m, -m</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option makes diff output for merge commits to be
  shown in the default format. <b>-m</b> will produce the output only if
  <b>-p</b> is given as well. The default format could be changed using
  <b>log.diffMerges</b> configuration parameter, which default value is
  <b>separate</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-merges=first-parent, --diff-merges=1</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option makes merge commits show the full diff with
  respect to the first parent only.</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-merges=separate</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This makes merge commits show the full diff with respect
  to each of the parents. Separate log entry and diff is generated for each
  parent.</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-merges=combined, --diff-merges=c, -c</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">With this option, diff output for a merge commit shows
  the differences from each of the parents to the merge result simultaneously
  instead of showing pairwise diff between a parent and the result one at a
  time. Furthermore, it lists only files which were modified from all parents.
  <b>-c</b> implies <b>-p</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-merges=dense-combined, --diff-merges=cc, --cc</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">With this option the output produced by
  <b>--diff-merges=combined</b> is further compressed by omitting uninteresting
  hunks whose contents in the parents have only two variants and the merge
  result picks one of them without modification. <b>--cc</b> implies
  <b>-p</b>.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--combined-all-paths</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This flag causes combined diffs (used for merge commits)
  to list the name of the file from all parents. It thus only has effect when
  <b>--diff-merges=[dense-]combined</b> is in use, and is likely only useful if
  filename changes are detected (i.e. when either rename or copy detection have
  been requested).</div>
<p class="Pp">-U&lt;n&gt;, --unified=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of

<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the character used to indicate new, old or
  context lines in the generated patch. Normally they are <i>+</i>, <i>-</i> and

<p class="Pp">--raw</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For each commit, show a summary of changes using the raw
  diff format. See the &quot;RAW OUTPUT FORMAT&quot; section of
  <b>git-diff</b>(1). This is different from showing the log itself in raw
  format, which you can achieve with <b>--format=raw</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--patch-with-raw</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for <b>-p --raw</b>.</div>

<p class="Pp">--no-indent-heuristic</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disable the indent heuristic.</div>
<p class="Pp">--minimal</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff
  is produced.</div>
<p class="Pp">--patience</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate a diff using the &quot;patience diff&quot;

<p class="Pp">--histogram</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate a diff using the &quot;histogram diff&quot;
  algorithm.</div>
<p class="Pp">--anchored=&lt;text&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate a diff using the &quot;anchored diff&quot;
  algorithm.
<p class="Pp">This option may be specified more than once.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a line exists in both the source and destination, exists only
    once, and starts with this text, this algorithm attempts to prevent it from
    appearing as a deletion or addition in the output. It uses the
    &quot;patience diff&quot; algorithm internally.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:
<p class="Pp"><b>default</b>, <b>myers</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the

<p class="Pp"><b>minimal</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff

<p class="Pp"><b>patience</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use &quot;patience diff&quot; algorithm when generating

<p class="Pp"><b>histogram</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to
  &quot;support low-occurrence common elements&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">For instance, if you configured the <b>diff.algorithm</b> variable
    to a non-default value and want to use the default one, then you have to use
    <b>--diff-algorithm=default</b> option.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--stat[=&lt;width&gt;[,&lt;name-width&gt;[,&lt;count&gt;]]]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate a diffstat. By default, as much space as
  necessary will be used for the filename part, and the rest for the graph part.
  Maximum width defaults to terminal width, or 80 columns if not connected to a
  terminal, and can be overridden by <b>&lt;width&gt;</b>. The width of the
  filename part can be limited by giving another width <b>&lt;name-width&gt;</b>
  after a comma. The width of the graph part can be limited by using
  <b>--stat-graph-width=&lt;width&gt;</b> (affects all commands generating a
  stat graph) or by setting <b>diff.statGraphWidth=&lt;width&gt;</b> (does not
  affect <b>git format-patch</b>). By giving a third parameter
  <b>&lt;count&gt;</b>, you can limit the output to the first
  <b>&lt;count&gt;</b> lines, followed by <b>...</b> if there are more.
<p class="Pp">These parameters can also be set individually with
    <b>--stat-width=&lt;width&gt;</b>,
    <b>--stat-name-width=&lt;name-width&gt;</b> and
    <b>--stat-count=&lt;count&gt;</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--compact-summary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output a condensed summary of extended header information
  such as file creations or deletions (&quot;new&quot; or &quot;gone&quot;,
  optionally &quot;+l&quot; if it&#x2019;s a symlink) and mode changes
  (&quot;+x&quot; or &quot;-x&quot; for adding or removing executable bit
  respectively) in diffstat. The information is put between the filename part
  and the graph part. Implies <b>--stat</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--numstat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Similar to <b>--stat</b>, but shows number of added and
  deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation, to make
  it more machine friendly. For binary files, outputs two <b>-</b> instead of
  saying <b>0 0</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--shortstat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output only the last line of the <b>--stat</b> format
  containing total number of modified files, as well as number of added and
  deleted lines.</div>
<p class="Pp">-X[&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;],
    --dirstat[=&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for
  each sub-directory. The behavior of <b>--dirstat</b> can be customized by
  passing it a comma separated list of parameters. The defaults are controlled
  by the <b>diff.dirstat</b> configuration variable (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).
  The following parameters are available:
<p class="Pp"><b>changes</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that
  have been removed from the source, or added to the destination. This ignores
  the amount of pure code movements within a file. In other words, rearranging
  lines in a file is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default
  behavior when no parameter is given.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>lines</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular
  line-based diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts. (For
  binary files, count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural
  concept of lines). This is a more expensive <b>--dirstat</b> behavior than the
  <b>changes</b> behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as
  much as other changes. The resulting output is consistent with what you get
  from the other <b>--*stat</b> options.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>files</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of
  files changed. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis. This
  is the computationally cheapest <b>--dirstat</b> behavior, since it does not
  have to look at the file contents at all.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>cumulative</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Count changes in a child directory for the parent
  directory as well. Note that when using <b>cumulative</b>, the sum of the
  percentages reported may exceed 100%. The default (non-cumulative) behavior
  can be specified with the <b>noncumulative</b> parameter.</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;limit&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by
  default). Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes
  are not shown in the output.</div>
<p class="Pp">Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring
    directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and
    accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
    <b>--dirstat=files,10,cumulative</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--cumulative</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for --dirstat=cumulative</div>
<p class="Pp">--dirstat-by-file[=&lt;param1,param2&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for --dirstat=files,param1,param2...</div>
<p class="Pp">--summary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output a condensed summary of extended header information
  such as creations, renames and mode changes.</div>
<p class="Pp">--patch-with-stat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for <b>-p --stat</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-z</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Separate the commits with NULs instead of with new
  newlines.
<p class="Pp">Also, when <b>--raw</b> or <b>--numstat</b> has been given, do not
    munge pathnames and use NULs as output field terminators.</p>
<p class="Pp">Without this option, pathnames with &quot;unusual&quot; characters
    are quoted as explained for the configuration variable <b>core.quotePath</b>
    (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--name-only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show only names of changed files. The file names are
  often encoded in UTF-8. For more information see the discussion about encoding
  in the <b>git-log</b>(1) manual page.</div>
<p class="Pp">--name-status</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show only names and status of changed files. See the
  description of the <b>--diff-filter</b> option on what the status letters
  mean. Just like <b>--name-only</b> the file names are often encoded in
  UTF-8.</div>
<p class="Pp">--submodule[=&lt;format&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify how differences in submodules are shown. When
  specifying <b>--submodule=short</b> the <i>short</i> format is used. This
  format just shows the names of the commits at the beginning and end of the
  range. When <b>--submodule</b> or <b>--submodule=log</b> is specified, the
  <i>log</i> format is used. This format lists the commits in the range like
  <b>git-submodule</b>(1) <b>summary</b> does. When <b>--submodule=diff</b> is
  specified, the <i>diff</i> format is used. This format shows an inline diff of
  the changes in the submodule contents between the commit range. Defaults to
  <b>diff.submodule</b> or the <i>short</i> format if the config option is
  unset.</div>
<p class="Pp">--color[=&lt;when&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show colored diff. <b>--color</b> (i.e. without

<p class="Pp">plain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Any line that is added in one location and was removed in
  another location will be colored with <i>color.diff.newMoved</i>. Similarly
  <i>color.diff.oldMoved</i> will be used for removed lines that are added
  somewhere else in the diff. This mode picks up any moved line, but it is not
  very useful in a review to determine if a block of code was moved without
  permutation.</div>
<p class="Pp">blocks</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Blocks of moved text of at least 20 alphanumeric
  characters are detected greedily. The detected blocks are painted using either
  the <i>color.diff.{old,new}Moved</i> color. Adjacent blocks cannot be told
  apart.</div>
<p class="Pp">zebra</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Blocks of moved text are detected as in <i>blocks</i>
  mode. The blocks are painted using either the <i>color.diff.{old,new}Moved</i>
  color or <i>color.diff.{old,new}MovedAlternative</i>. The change between the
  two colors indicates that a new block was detected.</div>
<p class="Pp">dimmed-zebra</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Similar to <i>zebra</i>, but additional dimming of
  uninteresting parts of moved code is performed. The bordering lines of two
  adjacent blocks are considered interesting, the rest is uninteresting.
  <b>dimmed_zebra</b> is a deprecated synonym.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-color-moved</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn off move detection. This can be used to override
  configuration settings. It is the same as <b>--color-moved=no</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--color-moved-ws=&lt;modes&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This configures how whitespace is ignored when performing
  the move detection for <b>--color-moved</b>. These modes can be given as a

<p class="Pp">no</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not ignore whitespace when performing move

<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.</div>
<p class="Pp">ignore-space-change</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores

  whitespace characters to be equivalent.</div>
<p class="Pp">ignore-all-space</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores
  differences even if one line has whitespace where the other line has
  none.</div>
<p class="Pp">allow-indentation-change</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Initially ignore any whitespace in the move detection,

<p class="Pp">--no-color-moved-ws</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not ignore whitespace when performing move detection.
  This can be used to override configuration settings. It is the same as
  <b>--color-moved-ws=no</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--word-diff[=&lt;mode&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show a word diff, using the &lt;mode&gt; to delimit
  changed words. By default, words are delimited by whitespace; see
  <b>--word-diff-regex</b> below. The &lt;mode&gt; defaults to <i>plain</i>, and
  must be one of:
<p class="Pp">color</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Highlight changed words using only colors. Implies
  <b>--color</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">plain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show words as <b>[-removed-]</b> and <b>{+added+}</b>.
  Makes no attempts to escape the delimiters if they appear in the input, so the
  output may be ambiguous.</div>
<p class="Pp">porcelain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use a special line-based format intended for script
  consumption. Added/removed/unchanged runs are printed in the usual unified
  diff format, starting with a <b>+</b>/<b>-</b>/` ` character at the beginning
  of the line and extending to the end of the line. Newlines in the input are
  represented by a tilde <b>~</b> on a line of its own.</div>
<p class="Pp">none</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disable word diff again.</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that despite the name of the first mode, color is used to
    highlight the changed parts in all modes if enabled.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--word-diff-regex=&lt;regex&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use &lt;regex&gt; to decide what a word is, instead of
  considering runs of non-whitespace to be a word. Also implies
  <b>--word-diff</b> unless it was already enabled.
<p class="Pp">Every non-overlapping match of the &lt;regex&gt; is considered a
    word. Anything between these matches is considered whitespace and ignored(!)
    for the purposes of finding differences. You may want to append
    <b>|[^[:space:]]</b> to your regular expression to make sure that it matches
    all non-whitespace characters. A match that contains a newline is silently
    truncated(!) at the newline.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, <b>--word-diff-regex=.</b> will treat each character
    as a word and, correspondingly, show differences character by character.</p>
<p class="Pp">The regex can also be set via a diff driver or configuration
    option, see <b>gitattributes</b>(5) or <b>git-config</b>(1). Giving it
    explicitly overrides any diff driver or configuration setting. Diff drivers
    override configuration settings.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--color-words[=&lt;regex&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Equivalent to <b>--word-diff=color</b> plus (if a regex
  was specified) <b>--word-diff-regex=&lt;regex&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-renames</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration
  file gives the default to do so.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]rename-empty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether to use empty blobs as rename source.</div>
<p class="Pp">--check</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Warn if changes introduce conflict markers or whitespace
  errors. What are considered whitespace errors is controlled by
  <b>core.whitespace</b> configuration. By default, trailing whitespaces
  (including lines that consist solely of whitespaces) and a space character
  that is immediately followed by a tab character inside the initial indent of
  the line are considered whitespace errors. Exits with non-zero status if
  problems are found. Not compatible with --exit-code.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ws-error-highlight=&lt;kind&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Highlight whitespace errors in the <b>context</b>,
  <b>old</b> or <b>new</b> lines of the diff. Multiple values are separated by
  comma, <b>none</b> resets previous values, <b>default</b> reset the list to
  <b>new</b> and <b>all</b> is a shorthand for <b>old,new,context</b>. When this
  option is not given, and the configuration variable
  <b>diff.wsErrorHighlight</b> is not set, only whitespace errors in <b>new</b>
  lines are highlighted. The whitespace errors are colored with
  <b>color.diff.whitespace</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--full-index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full
  pre- and post-image blob object names on the &quot;index&quot; line when
  generating patch format output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--binary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to <b>--full-index</b>, output a binary diff
  that can be applied with <b>git-apply</b>. Implies <b>--patch</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object
  name in diff-raw format output and diff-tree header lines, show the shortest
  prefix that is at least <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> hexdigits long that uniquely refers
  the object. In diff-patch output format, <b>--full-index</b> takes higher
  precedence, i.e. if <b>--full-index</b> is specified, full blob names will be
  shown regardless of <b>--abbrev</b>. Non default number of digits can be
  specified with <b>--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-B[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;],
    --break-rewrites[=[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;]]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and
  create. This serves two purposes:
<p class="Pp">It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a
    file not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very
    few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single
    deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything new,
    and the number <b>m</b> controls this aspect of the -B option (defaults to
    60%). <b>-B/70%</b> specifies that less than 30% of the original should
    remain in the result for Git to consider it a total rewrite (i.e. otherwise
    the resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion mixed
    together with context lines).</p>
<p class="Pp">When used with -M, a totally-rewritten file is also considered as
    the source of a rename (usually -M only considers a file that disappeared as
    the source of a rename), and the number <b>n</b> controls this aspect of the
    -B option (defaults to 50%). <b>-B20%</b> specifies that a change with
    addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file&#x2019;s size are
    eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to another
    file.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-M[&lt;n&gt;], --find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If generating diffs, detect and report renames for each
  commit. For following files across renames while traversing history, see
  <b>--follow</b>. If <b>n</b> is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity
  index (i.e. amount of addition/deletions compared to the file&#x2019;s size).
  For example, <b>-M90%</b> means Git should consider a delete/add pair to be a
  rename if more than 90% of the file hasn&#x2019;t changed. Without a <b>%</b>
  sign, the number is to be read as a fraction, with a decimal point before it.
  I.e., <b>-M5</b> becomes 0.5, and is thus the same as <b>-M50%</b>. Similarly,
  <b>-M05</b> is the same as <b>-M5%</b>. To limit detection to exact renames,
  use <b>-M100%</b>. The default similarity index is 50%.</div>
<p class="Pp">-C[&lt;n&gt;], --find-copies[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Detect copies as well as renames. See also
  <b>--find-copies-harder</b>. If <b>n</b> is specified, it has the same meaning
  as for <b>-M&lt;n&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--find-copies-harder</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For performance reasons, by default, <b>-C</b> option
  finds copies only if the original file of the copy was modified in the same
  changeset. This flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates
  for the source of copy. This is a very expensive operation for large projects,
  so use it with caution. Giving more than one <b>-C</b> option has the same
  effect.</div>
<p class="Pp">-D, --irreversible-delete</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Omit the preimage for deletes, i.e. print only the header
  but not the diff between the preimage and <b>/dev/null</b>. The resulting
  patch is not meant to be applied with <b>patch</b> or <b>git apply</b>; this
  is solely for people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the text after
  the change. In addition, the output obviously lacks enough information to
  apply such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of the option.
<p class="Pp">When used together with <b>-B</b>, omit also the preimage in the
    deletion part of a delete/create pair.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-l&lt;num&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>-M</b> and <b>-C</b> options require O(n^2)
  processing time where n is the number of potential rename/copy targets. This
  option prevents rename/copy detection from running if the number of
  rename/copy targets exceeds the specified number.</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-filter=[(A|C|D|M|R|T|U|X|B)...[*]]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Select only files that are Added (<b>A</b>), Copied
  (<b>C</b>), Deleted (<b>D</b>), Modified (<b>M</b>), Renamed (<b>R</b>), have
  their type (i.e. regular file, symlink, submodule, ...) changed (<b>T</b>),
  are Unmerged (<b>U</b>), are Unknown (<b>X</b>), or have had their pairing
  Broken (<b>B</b>). Any combination of the filter characters (including none)
  can be used. When <b>*</b> (All-or-none) is added to the combination, all
  paths are selected if there is any file that matches other criteria in the
  comparison; if there is no file that matches other criteria, nothing is
  selected.
<p class="Pp">Also, these upper-case letters can be downcased to exclude. E.g.
    <b>--diff-filter=ad</b> excludes added and deleted paths.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that not all diffs can feature all types. For instance, diffs
    from the index to the working tree can never have Added entries (because the
    set of paths included in the diff is limited by what is in the index).
    Similarly, copied and renamed entries cannot appear if detection for those
    types is disabled.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-S&lt;string&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Look for differences that change the number of
  occurrences of the specified string (i.e. addition/deletion) in a file.
  Intended for the scripter&#x2019;s use.
<p class="Pp">It is useful when you&#x2019;re looking for an exact block of code
    (like a struct), and want to know the history of that block since it first
    came into being: use the feature iteratively to feed the interesting block
    in the preimage back into <b>-S</b>, and keep going until you get the very
    first version of the block.</p>
<p class="Pp">Binary files are searched as well.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-G&lt;regex&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Look for differences whose patch text contains
  added/removed lines that match &lt;regex&gt;.
<p class="Pp">To illustrate the difference between <b>-S&lt;regex&gt;
    --pickaxe-regex</b> and <b>-G&lt;regex&gt;</b>, consider a commit with the
    following diff in the same file:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
+    return frotz(nitfol, two-&gt;ptr, 1, 0);
...
-    hit = frotz(nitfol, mf2.ptr, 1, 0);
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">While <b>git log -G&quot;frotz\(nitfol&quot;</b> will show this
    commit, <b>git log -S&quot;frotz\(nitfol&quot; --pickaxe-regex</b> will not
    (because the number of occurrences of that string did not change).</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless <b>--text</b> is supplied patches of binary files without a
    textconv filter will be ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the <i>pickaxe</i> entry in <b>gitdiffcore</b>(7) for more
    information.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--find-object=&lt;object-id&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Look for differences that change the number of
  occurrences of the specified object. Similar to <b>-S</b>, just the argument
  is different in that it doesn&#x2019;t search for a specific string but for a
  specific object id.
<p class="Pp">The object can be a blob or a submodule commit. It implies the
    <b>-t</b> option in <b>git-log</b> to also find trees.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--pickaxe-all</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <b>-S</b> or <b>-G</b> finds a change, show all the
  changes in that changeset, not just the files that contain the change in
  &lt;string&gt;.</div>
<p class="Pp">--pickaxe-regex</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Treat the &lt;string&gt; given to <b>-S</b> as an
  extended POSIX regular expression to match.</div>
<p class="Pp">-O&lt;orderfile&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Control the order in which files appear in the output.
  This overrides the <b>diff.orderFile</b> configuration variable (see
  <b>git-config</b>(1)). To cancel <b>diff.orderFile</b>, use
  <b>-O/dev/null</b>.
<p class="Pp">The output order is determined by the order of glob patterns in
    &lt;orderfile&gt;. All files with pathnames that match the first pattern are
    output first, all files with pathnames that match the second pattern (but
    not the first) are output next, and so on. All files with pathnames that do
    not match any pattern are output last, as if there was an implicit match-all
    pattern at the end of the file. If multiple pathnames have the same rank
    (they match the same pattern but no earlier patterns), their output order
    relative to each other is the normal order.</p>
<p class="Pp">&lt;orderfile&gt; is parsed as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Blank lines are ignored, so they can be used as
  separators for readability.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Lines starting with a hash (&quot;<b>#</b>&quot;)
  are ignored, so they can be used for comments. Add a backslash
  (&quot;<b>\</b>&quot;) to the beginning of the pattern if it starts with a
  hash.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Each other line contains a single pattern.</div>
<p class="Pp">Patterns have the same syntax and semantics as patterns used for
    fnmatch(3) without the FNM_PATHNAME flag, except a pathname also matches a
    pattern if removing any number of the final pathname components matches the
    pattern. For example, the pattern &quot;<b>foo*bar</b>&quot; matches
    &quot;<b>fooasdfbar</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>foo/bar/baz/asdf</b>&quot; but
    not &quot;<b>foobarx</b>&quot;.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--skip-to=&lt;file&gt;, --rotate-to=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Discard the files before the named &lt;file&gt; from the
  output (i.e. <i>skip to</i>), or move them to the end of the output (i.e.
  <i>rotate to</i>). These were invented primarily for use of the <b>git
  difftool</b> command, and may not be very useful otherwise.</div>
<p class="Pp">-R</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index or
  on-disk file to tree contents.</div>
<p class="Pp">--relative[=&lt;path&gt;], --no-relative</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be
  told to exclude changes outside the directory and show pathnames relative to
  it with this option. When you are not in a subdirectory (e.g. in a bare
  repository), you can name which subdirectory to make the output relative to by
  giving a &lt;path&gt; as an argument. <b>--no-relative</b> can be used to
  countermand both <b>diff.relative</b> config option and previous
  <b>--relative</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-a, --text</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Treat all files as text.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-cr-at-eol</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore carriage-return at the end of line when doing a
  comparison.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-space-at-eol</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.</div>
<p class="Pp">-b, --ignore-space-change</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores
  whitespace at line end, and considers all other sequences of one or more
  whitespace characters to be equivalent.</div>
<p class="Pp">-w, --ignore-all-space</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores
  differences even if one line has whitespace where the other line has
  none.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-blank-lines</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.</div>
<p class="Pp">-I&lt;regex&gt;, --ignore-matching-lines=&lt;regex&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes whose all lines match &lt;regex&gt;. This
  option may be specified more than once.</div>
<p class="Pp">--inter-hunk-context=&lt;lines&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified
  number of lines, thereby fusing hunks that are close to each other. Defaults
  to <b>diff.interHunkContext</b> or 0 if the config option is unset.</div>
<p class="Pp">-W, --function-context</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show whole function as context lines for each change. The
  function names are determined in the same way as <b>git diff</b> works out
  patch hunk headers (see <i>Defining a custom hunk-header</i> in
  <b>gitattributes</b>(5)).</div>
<p class="Pp">--ext-diff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow an external diff helper to be executed. If you set
  an external diff driver with <b>gitattributes</b>(5), you need to use this
  option with <b>git-log</b>(1) and friends.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-ext-diff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disallow external diff drivers.</div>
<p class="Pp">--textconv, --no-textconv</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow (or disallow) external text conversion filters to
  be run when comparing binary files. See <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for details.
  Because textconv filters are typically a one-way conversion, the resulting
  diff is suitable for human consumption, but cannot be applied. For this
  reason, textconv filters are enabled by default only for <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  and <b>git-log</b>(1), but not for <b>git-format-patch</b>(1) or diff plumbing
  commands.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-submodules[=&lt;when&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation.
  &lt;when&gt; can be either &quot;none&quot;, &quot;untracked&quot;,
  &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;all&quot;, which is the default. Using
  &quot;none&quot; will consider the submodule modified when it either contains
  untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded in
  the superproject and can be used to override any settings of the <i>ignore</i>
  option in <b>git-config</b>(1) or <b>gitmodules</b>(5). When
  &quot;untracked&quot; is used submodules are not considered dirty when they
  only contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified
  content). Using &quot;dirty&quot; ignores all changes to the work tree of
  submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the superproject are shown
  (this was the behavior until 1.7.0). Using &quot;all&quot; hides all changes
  to submodules.</div>
<p class="Pp">--src-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the given source prefix instead of
  &quot;a/&quot;.</div>

<p class="Pp">--no-prefix</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not show any source or destination prefix.</div>
<p class="Pp">--line-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prepend an additional prefix to every line of
  output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ita-invisible-in-index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default entries added by &quot;git add -N&quot; appear
  as an existing empty file in &quot;git diff&quot; and a new file in &quot;git
  diff --cached&quot;. This option makes the entry appear as a new file in
  &quot;git diff&quot; and non-existent in &quot;git diff --cached&quot;. This
  option could be reverted with <b>--ita-visible-in-index</b>. Both options are
  experimental and could be removed in future.</div>

    option to produce a <i>combined diff</i> when showing a merge. This is the
    default format when showing merges with <b>git-diff</b>(1) or

<div class="Bd-indent">

<div class="Bd-indent">

deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;
</pre>

<p class="Pp">The <b>mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt;</b> line
    appears only if at least one of the &lt;mode&gt; is different from the rest.
    Extended headers with information about detected contents movement (renames
    and copying detection) are designed to work with diff of two
    &lt;tree-ish&gt; and are not used by combined diff format.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.It is followed by two-line from-file/to-file header
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
--- a/file
+++ b/file
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Similar to two-line header for traditional <i>unified</i> diff
    format, <b>/dev/null</b> is used to signal created or deleted files.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, if the --combined-all-paths option is provided, instead
    of a two-line from-file/to-file you get a N+1 line from-file/to-file header,
    where N is the number of parents in the merge commit</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
--- a/file
--- a/file
--- a/file
+++ b/file
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This extended format can be useful if rename or copy detection is
    active, to allow you to see the original name of the file in different
    parents.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from
  accidentally feeding it to <b>patch -p1</b>. Combined diff format was created
  for review of merge commit changes, and was not meant to be applied. The
  change is similar to the change in the extended <i>index</i> header:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
@@@ &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;to-file-range&gt; @@@
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">There are (number of parents + 1) <b>@</b> characters in the chunk
    header for combined diff format.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Unlike the traditional <i>unified</i> diff format, which shows two
    files A and B with a single column that has <b>-</b> (minus &#x2014; appears
    in A but removed in B), <b>+</b> (plus &#x2014; missing in A but added to
    B), or <b>&quot; &quot;</b> (space &#x2014; unchanged) prefix, this format
    compares two or more files file1, file2,... with one file X, and shows how X
    differs from each of fileN. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the
    output line to note how X&#x2019;s line is different from it.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <b>-</b> character in the column N means that the line appears
    in fileN but it does not appear in the result. A <b>+</b> character in the
    column N means that the line appears in the result, and fileN does not have
    that line (in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of
    that parent).</p>
<p class="Pp">In the above example output, the function signature was changed
    from both files (hence two <b>-</b> removals from both file1 and file2, plus
    <b>++</b> to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 or
    file2). Also eight other lines are the same from file1 but do not appear in
    file2 (hence prefixed with <b>+</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">When shown by <b>git diff-tree -c</b>, it compares the parents of
    a merge commit with the merge result (i.e. file1..fileN are the parents).
    When shown by <b>git diff-files -c</b>, it compares the two unresolved merge
    parents with the working tree file (i.e. file1 is stage 2 aka &quot;our
    version&quot;, file2 is stage 3 aka &quot;their version&quot;).</p>

<p class="Pp">Git is to some extent character encoding agnostic.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The contents of the blob objects are
  uninterpreted sequences of bytes. There is no encoding translation at the core
  level.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Path names are encoded in UTF-8 normalization
  form C. This applies to tree objects, the index file, ref names, as well as
  path names in command line arguments, environment variables and config files
  (<b>.git/config</b> (see <b>git-config</b>(1)), <b>gitignore</b>(5),
  <b>gitattributes</b>(5) and <b>gitmodules</b>(5)).
<p class="Pp">Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as
    sequences of non-NUL bytes, there are no path name encoding conversions
    (except on Mac and Windows). Therefore, using non-ASCII path names will
    mostly work even on platforms and file systems that use legacy extended
    ASCII encodings. However, repositories created on such systems will not work
    properly on UTF-8-based systems (e.g. Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice versa.
    Additionally, many Git-based tools simply assume path names to be UTF-8 and
    will fail to display other encodings correctly.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Commit log messages are typically encoded in
  UTF-8, but other extended ASCII encodings are also supported. This includes
  ISO-8859-x, CP125x and many others, but <i>not</i> UTF-16/32, EBCDIC and CJK
  multi-byte encodings (GBK, Shift-JIS, Big5, EUC-x, CP9xx etc.).</div>
<p class="Pp">Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in
    UTF-8, both the core and Git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF-8 on
    projects. If all participants of a particular project find it more
    convenient to use legacy encodings, Git does not forbid it. However, there
    are a few things to keep in mind.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.<i>git commit</i> and <i>git commit-tree</i> issues a
  warning if the commit log message given to it does not look like a valid UTF-8
  string, unless you explicitly say your project uses a legacy encoding. The way
  to say this is to have <b>i18n.commitEncoding</b> in <b>.git/config</b> file,
  like this:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
[i18n]
<br/>
        commitEncoding = ISO-8859-1
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Commit objects created with the above setting record the value of
    <b>i18n.commitEncoding</b> in its <b>encoding</b> header. This is to help
    other people who look at them later. Lack of this header implies that the
    commit log message is encoded in UTF-8.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.<i>git log</i>, <i>git show</i>, <i>git blame</i> and
  friends look at the <b>encoding</b> header of a commit object, and try to
  re-code the log message into UTF-8 unless otherwise specified. You can specify
  the desired output encoding with <b>i18n.logOutputEncoding</b> in
  <b>.git/config</b> file, like this:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
[i18n]
<br/>
        logOutputEncoding = ISO-8859-1
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If you do not have this configuration variable, the value of
    <b>i18n.commitEncoding</b> is used instead.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that we deliberately chose not to re-code the commit log
    message when a commit is made to force UTF-8 at the commit object level,
    because re-coding to UTF-8 is not necessarily a reversible operation.</p>
