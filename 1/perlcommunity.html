<p class="Pp">perlcommunity - a brief overview of the Perl community</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This document aims to provide an overview of the vast perl
    community, which is far too large and diverse to provide a detailed listing.
    If any specific niche has been forgotten, it is not meant as an insult but
    an omission for the sake of brevity.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Perl community is as diverse as Perl, and there is a large
    amount of evidence that the Perl users apply TMTOWTDI to all endeavors, not
    just programming. From websites, to IRC, to mailing lists, there is more
    than one way to get involved in the community.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Where_to_Find_the_Community"><a class="permalink" href="#Where_to_Find_the_Community">Where
  to Find the Community</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There is a central directory for the Perl community:
    &lt;https://perl.org&gt; maintained by the Perl Foundation
    (&lt;https://www.perlfoundation.org/&gt;), which tracks and provides
    services for a variety of other community sites.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Raku</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Perl's sister language, Raku (formerly known as Perl 6), maintains
    its own directory of community resources at
    &lt;https://raku.org/community/&gt;.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Mailing_Lists_and_Newsgroups"><a class="permalink" href="#Mailing_Lists_and_Newsgroups">Mailing
  Lists and Newsgroups</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl runs on e-mail; there is no doubt about it. The Camel book
    was originally written mostly over e-mail and today Perl's development is
    co-ordinated through mailing lists. The largest repository of Perl mailing
    lists is located at &lt;https://lists.perl.org&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most Perl-related projects set up mailing lists for both users and
    contributors. If you don't see a certain project listed at
    &lt;https://lists.perl.org&gt;, check the particular website for that
    project. Most mailing lists are archived at
    &lt;https://www.nntp.perl.org/&gt;.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">IRC</h2>
<p class="Pp">The Perl community has a rather large IRC presence. For starters,
    it has its own IRC network, &lt;irc://irc.perl.org&gt;. General (not
    help-oriented) chat can be found at &lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#perl&gt;. Many
    other more specific chats are also hosted on the network. Information about
    irc.perl.org is located on the network's website:
    &lt;https://www.irc.perl.org&gt;. For a more help-oriented #perl, check out
    &lt;irc://irc.libera.chat/#perl&gt;. Most Perl-related channels will be kind
    enough to point you in the right direction if you ask nicely.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any large IRC network (Dalnet, EFnet) is also likely to have a
    #perl channel, with varying activity levels.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Websites"><a class="permalink" href="#Websites">Websites</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl websites come in a variety of forms, but they fit into two
    large categories: forums and news websites. There are many Perl-related
    websites, so only a few of the community's largest are mentioned here.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>News sites</i></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&lt;https://perl.com/&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Originally run by O'Reilly Media (the publisher of the Camel Book, this
      site provides quality articles mostly about technical details of
    Perl.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;http://blogs.perl.org/&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Many members of the community have a Perl-related blog on this site. If
      you'd like to join them, you can sign up for free.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;http://perlsphere.net/&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Perlsphere is one of several aggregators of Perl-related blog feeds.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;http://perlweekly.com/&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Perl Weekly is a weekly mailing list that keeps you up to date on
      conferences, releases and notable blog posts.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><i>Forums</i></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&lt;https://www.perlmonks.org/&gt;</dt>
  <dd>PerlMonks is one of the largest Perl forums, and describes itself as
      &quot;A place for individuals to polish, improve, and showcase their Perl
      skills.&quot; and &quot;A community which allows everyone to grow and
      learn from each other.&quot;</dd>
  <dt>&lt;https://stackoverflow.com/&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Stack Overflow is a free question-and-answer site for programmers. It's
      not focussed solely on Perl, but it does have an active group of users who
      do their best to help people with their Perl programming questions.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;http://prepan.org/&gt;</dt>
  <dd>PrePAN is used as a place to discuss modules that you're considering
      uploading to the CPAN. You can get feedback on their design before you
      upload.</dd>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="User_Groups"><a class="permalink" href="#User_Groups">User
  Groups</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Many cities around the world have local Perl Mongers chapters. A
    Perl Mongers chapter is a local user group which typically holds regular
    in-person meetings, both social and technical; helps organize local
    conferences, workshops, and hackathons; and provides a mailing list or other
    continual contact method for its members to keep in touch.</p>
<p class="Pp">To find your local Perl Mongers (or PM as they're commonly
    abbreviated) group check the international Perl Mongers directory at
    &lt;https://www.pm.org/&gt;.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Workshops"><a class="permalink" href="#Workshops">Workshops</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl workshops are, as the name might suggest, workshops where
    Perl is taught in a variety of ways. At the workshops, subjects range from a
    beginner's introduction (such as the Pittsburgh Perl Workshop's &quot;Zero
    To Perl&quot;) to much more advanced subjects.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are several great resources for locating workshops: the
    websites mentioned above, the calendar mentioned below, and the YAPC Europe
    website, &lt;http://www.yapceurope.org/&gt;, which is probably the best
    resource for European Perl events.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Hackathons"><a class="permalink" href="#Hackathons">Hackathons</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Hackathons are a very different kind of gathering where Perl
    hackers gather to do just that, hack nonstop for an extended (several day)
    period on a specific project or projects. Information about hackathons can
    be located in the same place as information about workshops as well as in
    &lt;irc://irc.perl.org/#perl&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you have never been to a hackathon, here are a few basic things
    you need to know before attending: have a working laptop and know how to use
    it; check out the involved projects beforehand; have the necessary version
    control client; and bring backup equipment (an extra LAN cable, additional
    power strips, etc.) because someone will forget.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Conventions"><a class="permalink" href="#Conventions">Conventions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl had two major annual conventions: The Perl Conference (now
    part of OSCON), put on by O'Reilly, and Yet Another Perl Conference or YAPC
    (pronounced yap-see), which is localized into several regional YAPCs (North
    America, Europe, Asia) in a stunning grassroots display by the Perl
    community.</p>
<p class="Pp">In 2016, YAPC was rebranded as The Perl Conference again. It is
    now referred to as The Perl and Raku Conference.</p>
<p class="Pp">OSCON had been discontinued.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more information about either conference, check out their
    respective web pages:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The Perl Conference
    <p class="Pp">&lt;http://perlconference.us/&gt;.</p>
  </li>
  <li>OSCON
    <p class="Pp">&lt;https://www.oreilly.com/conferences/&gt;</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">An additional conference franchise with a large Perl portion was
    the Open Source Developers Conference or OSDC. First held in Australia, it
    also spread to Israel and France. More information can be found at:
    &lt;http://www.osdc.org.il&gt; for Israel, and &lt;http://www.osdc.fr/&gt;
    for France.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Calendar_of_Perl_Events"><a class="permalink" href="#Calendar_of_Perl_Events">Calendar
  of Perl Events</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Perl Review, &lt;http://www.theperlreview.com&gt; maintains a
    website and Google calendar for tracking workshops, hackathons, Perl Mongers
    meetings, and other events. A view of this calendar is available at
    &lt;https://www.perl.org/events.html&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Not every event or Perl Mongers group is on that calendar, so
    don't lose heart if you don't see yours posted. To have your event or group
    listed, contact brian d foy (brian@theperlreview.com).</p>
