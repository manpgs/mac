    a Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some

    in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable

      programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution
      provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.

      scripts or library files are aggregated with this Package via the
      so-called &quot;undump&quot; or &quot;unexec&quot; methods of producing a
      binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall neither
      be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it fall under the

      in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do not change the language in
      any way that would cause it to fail the regression tests for the
    language.</dd>
  <dt>8.</dt>
  <dd>Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
      permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is, when

      as a distribution of this Package.</dd>
