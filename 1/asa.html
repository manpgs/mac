<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">asa</code> utility reads files sequentially,
    mapping FORTRAN carriage-control characters to line-printer control
    sequences, and writes them to the standard output.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first character of each line is interpreted as a
    carriage-control character. The following characters are interpreted as
    follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&lt;space&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Output the rest of the line without change.</dd>
  <dt>0</dt>
  <dd>Output a &lt;newline&gt; character before printing the rest of the
    line.</dd>

  <dd>Output a &lt;formfeed&gt; character before printing the rest of the
    line.</dd>
  <dt>+</dt>
  <dd>The trailing &lt;newline&gt; of the previous line is replaced by a
      &lt;carriage-return&gt; before printing the rest of the line.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Lines beginning with characters other than the above are treated
    as if they begin with &lt;space&gt;.</p>
