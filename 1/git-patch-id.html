<p class="Pp">Read a patch from the standard input and compute the patch ID for
    it.</p>
<p class="Pp">A &quot;patch ID&quot; is nothing but a sum of SHA-1 of the file
    diffs associated with a patch, with line numbers ignored. As such,
    it&#x2019;s &quot;reasonably stable&quot;, but at the same time also
    reasonably unique, i.e., two patches that have the same &quot;patch ID&quot;
    are almost guaranteed to be the same thing.</p>
<p class="Pp">The main usecase for this command is to look for likely duplicate
    commits.</p>
<p class="Pp">When dealing with <i>git diff-tree</i> output, it takes advantage
    of the fact that the patch is prefixed with the object name of the commit,
    and outputs two 40-byte hexadecimal strings. The first string is the patch
    ID, and the second string is the commit ID. This can be used to make a
    mapping from patch ID to commit ID.</p>

<p class="Pp">--verbatim</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Calculate the patch-id of the input as it is given, do

<pre>This is the default if patchid.verbatim is true.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--stable</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use a &quot;stable&quot; sum of hashes as the patch ID.
  With this option:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Reordering file diffs that make up a patch does
  not affect the ID. In particular, two patches produced by comparing the same
  two trees with two different settings for &quot;-O&lt;orderfile&gt;&quot;
  result in the same patch ID signature, thereby allowing the computed result to
  be used as a key to index some meta-information about the change between the
  two trees;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Result is different from the value produced by
  git 1.9 and older or produced when an &quot;unstable&quot; hash (see
  --unstable below) is configured - even when used on a diff output taken
  without any use of &quot;-O&lt;orderfile&gt;&quot;, thereby making existing
  databases storing such &quot;unstable&quot; or historical patch-ids
  unusable.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;All whitespace within the patch is ignored and
  does not affect the id.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>This is the default if patchid.stable is set to true.</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--unstable</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use an &quot;unstable&quot; hash as the patch ID. With
  this option, the result produced is compatible with the patch-id value
  produced by git 1.9 and older and whitespace is ignored. Users with
  pre-existing databases storing patch-ids produced by git 1.9 and older (who do
  not deal with reordered patches) may want to use this option.
