<p class="Pp">Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects
    necessary to complete the given refs.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can make interesting things happen to a repository every time
    you push into it, by setting up <i>hooks</i> there. See documentation for
    <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">When the command line does not specify where to push with the
    <b>&lt;repository&gt;</b> argument, <b>branch.*.remote</b> configuration for
    the current branch is consulted to determine where to push. If the
    configuration is missing, it defaults to <i>origin</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the command line does not specify what to push with
    <b>&lt;refspec&gt;...</b> arguments or <b>--all</b>, <b>--mirror</b>,
    <b>--tags</b> options, the command finds the default <b>&lt;refspec&gt;</b>
    by consulting <b>remote.*.push</b> configuration, and if it is not found,
    honors <b>push.default</b> configuration to decide what to push (See
    <b>git-config</b>(1) for the meaning of <b>push.default</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">When neither the command-line nor the configuration specify what
    to push, the default behavior is used, which corresponds to the
    <b>simple</b> value for <b>push.default</b>: the current branch is pushed to
    the corresponding upstream branch, but as a safety measure, the push is
    aborted if the upstream branch does not have the same name as the local
  one.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">&lt;repository&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The &quot;remote&quot; repository that is destination of
  a push operation. This parameter can be either a URL (see the section GIT URLS
  below) or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES below).</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;refspec&gt;...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify what destination ref to update with what source
  object. The format of a &lt;refspec&gt; parameter is an optional plus
  <b>+</b>, followed by the source object &lt;src&gt;, followed by a colon
  <b>:</b>, followed by the destination ref &lt;dst&gt;.
<p class="Pp">The &lt;src&gt; is often the name of the branch you would want to
    push, but it can be any arbitrary &quot;SHA-1 expression&quot;, such as
    <b>master~4</b> or <b>HEAD</b> (see <b>gitrevisions</b>(7)).</p>
<p class="Pp">The &lt;dst&gt; tells which ref on the remote side is updated with
    this push. Arbitrary expressions cannot be used here, an actual ref must be
    named. If <b>git push [&lt;repository&gt;]</b> without any
    <b>&lt;refspec&gt;</b> argument is set to update some ref at the destination
    with <b>&lt;src&gt;</b> with <b>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.push</b>
    configuration variable, <b>:&lt;dst&gt;</b> part can be omitted&#x2014;such
    a push will update a ref that <b>&lt;src&gt;</b> normally updates without
    any <b>&lt;refspec&gt;</b> on the command line. Otherwise, missing
    <b>:&lt;dst&gt;</b> means to update the same ref as the
  <b>&lt;src&gt;</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If &lt;dst&gt; doesn&#x2019;t start with <b>refs/</b> (e.g.
    <b>refs/heads/master</b>) we will try to infer where in <b>refs/*</b> on the
    destination &lt;repository&gt; it belongs based on the type of &lt;src&gt;
    being pushed and whether &lt;dst&gt; is ambiguous.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If &lt;dst&gt; unambiguously refers to a ref on
  the &lt;repository&gt; remote, then push to that ref.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If &lt;src&gt; resolves to a ref starting with
  refs/heads/ or refs/tags/, then prepend that to &lt;dst&gt;.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Other ambiguity resolutions might be added in the
  future, but for now any other cases will error out with an error indicating
  what we tried, and depending on the <b>advice.pushUnqualifiedRefname</b>
  configuration (see <b>git-config</b>(1)) suggest what refs/ namespace you may
  have wanted to push to.</div>
<p class="Pp">The object referenced by &lt;src&gt; is used to update the
    &lt;dst&gt; reference on the remote side. Whether this is allowed depends on
    where in <b>refs/*</b> the &lt;dst&gt; reference lives as described in
    detail below, in those sections &quot;update&quot; means any modifications
    except deletes, which as noted after the next few sections are treated
    differently.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>refs/heads/*</b> namespace will only accept commit objects,
    and updates only if they can be fast-forwarded.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>refs/tags/*</b> namespace will accept any kind of object
    (as commits, trees and blobs can be tagged), and any updates to them will be
    rejected.</p>
<p class="Pp">It&#x2019;s possible to push any type of object to any namespace
    outside of <b>refs/{tags,heads}/*</b>. In the case of tags and commits,
    these will be treated as if they were the commits inside <b>refs/heads/*</b>
    for the purposes of whether the update is allowed.</p>
<p class="Pp">I.e. a fast-forward of commits and tags outside
    <b>refs/{tags,heads}/*</b> is allowed, even in cases where what&#x2019;s
    being fast-forwarded is not a commit, but a tag object which happens to
    point to a new commit which is a fast-forward of the commit the last tag (or
    commit) it&#x2019;s replacing. Replacing a tag with an entirely different
    tag is also allowed, if it points to the same commit, as well as pushing a
    peeled tag, i.e. pushing the commit that existing tag object points to, or a
    new tag object which an existing commit points to.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tree and blob objects outside of <b>refs/{tags,heads}/*</b> will
    be treated the same way as if they were inside <b>refs/tags/*</b>, any
    update of them will be rejected.</p>
<p class="Pp">All of the rules described above about what&#x2019;s not allowed
    as an update can be overridden by adding an the optional leading <b>+</b> to
    a refspec (or using <b>--force</b> command line option). The only exception
    to this is that no amount of forcing will make the <b>refs/heads/*</b>
    namespace accept a non-commit object. Hooks and configuration can also
    override or amend these rules, see e.g. <b>receive.denyNonFastForwards</b>
    in <b>git-config</b>(1) and <b>pre-receive</b> and <b>update</b> in
    <b>githooks</b>(5).</p>
<p class="Pp">Pushing an empty &lt;src&gt; allows you to delete the &lt;dst&gt;
    ref from the remote repository. Deletions are always accepted without a
    leading <b>+</b> in the refspec (or <b>--force</b>), except when forbidden
    by configuration or hooks. See <b>receive.denyDeletes</b> in
    <b>git-config</b>(1) and <b>pre-receive</b> and <b>update</b> in
    <b>githooks</b>(5).</p>
<p class="Pp">The special refspec <b>:</b> (or <b>+:</b> to allow
    non-fast-forward updates) directs Git to push &quot;matching&quot; branches:
    for every branch that exists on the local side, the remote side is updated
    if a branch of the same name already exists on the remote side.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>tag &lt;tag&gt;</b> means the same as
    <b>refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;:refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--all</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Push all branches (i.e. refs under <b>refs/heads/</b>);
  cannot be used with other &lt;refspec&gt;.</div>
<p class="Pp">--prune</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Remove remote branches that don&#x2019;t have a local
  counterpart. For example a remote branch <b>tmp</b> will be removed if a local
  branch with the same name doesn&#x2019;t exist any more. This also respects
  refspecs, e.g. <b>git push --prune remote refs/heads/*:refs/tmp/*</b> would
  make sure that remote <b>refs/tmp/foo</b> will be removed if
  <b>refs/heads/foo</b> doesn&#x2019;t exist.</div>
<p class="Pp">--mirror</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies that all
  refs under <b>refs/</b> (which includes but is not limited to
  <b>refs/heads/</b>, <b>refs/remotes/</b>, and <b>refs/tags/</b>) be mirrored
  to the remote repository. Newly created local refs will be pushed to the
  remote end, locally updated refs will be force updated on the remote end, and
  deleted refs will be removed from the remote end. This is the default if the
  configuration option <b>remote.&lt;remote&gt;.mirror</b> is set.</div>
<p class="Pp">-n, --dry-run</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do everything except actually send the updates.</div>
<p class="Pp">--porcelain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Produce machine-readable output. The output status line
  for each ref will be tab-separated and sent to stdout instead of stderr. The
  full symbolic names of the refs will be given.</div>
<p class="Pp">-d, --delete</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">All listed refs are deleted from the remote repository.
  This is the same as prefixing all refs with a colon.</div>
<p class="Pp">--tags</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">All refs under <b>refs/tags</b> are pushed, in addition
  to refspecs explicitly listed on the command line.</div>
<p class="Pp">--follow-tags</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Push all the refs that would be pushed without this
  option, and also push annotated tags in <b>refs/tags</b> that are missing from
  the remote but are pointing at commit-ish that are reachable from the refs
  being pushed. This can also be specified with configuration variable
  <b>push.followTags</b>. For more information, see <b>push.followTags</b> in
  <b>git-config</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]signed, --signed=(true|false|if-asked)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">GPG-sign the push request to update refs on the receiving
  side, to allow it to be checked by the hooks and/or be logged. If <b>false</b>
  or <b>--no-signed</b>, no signing will be attempted. If <b>true</b> or
  <b>--signed</b>, the push will fail if the server does not support signed
  pushes. If set to <b>if-asked</b>, sign if and only if the server supports
  signed pushes. The push will also fail if the actual call to <b>gpg --sign</b>
  fails. See <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) for the details on the receiving
  end.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]atomic</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use an atomic transaction on the remote side if
  available. Either all refs are updated, or on error, no refs are updated. If
  the server does not support atomic pushes the push will fail.</div>
<p class="Pp">-o &lt;option&gt;, --push-option=&lt;option&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Transmit the given string to the server, which passes
  them to the pre-receive as well as the post-receive hook. The given string
  must not contain a NUL or LF character. When multiple
  <b>--push-option=&lt;option&gt;</b> are given, they are all sent to the other
  side in the order listed on the command line. When no
  <b>--push-option=&lt;option&gt;</b> is given from the command line, the values
  of configuration variable <b>push.pushOption</b> are used instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">--receive-pack=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;,
    --exec=&lt;git-receive-pack&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Path to the <i>git-receive-pack</i> program on the remote
  end. Sometimes useful when pushing to a remote repository over ssh, and you do
  not have the program in a directory on the default $PATH.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]force-with-lease, --force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;,
    --force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Usually, &quot;git push&quot; refuses to update a remote
  ref that is not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it.
<p class="Pp">This option overrides this restriction if the current value of the
    remote ref is the expected value. &quot;git push&quot; fails otherwise.</p>
<p class="Pp">Imagine that you have to rebase what you have already published.
    You will have to bypass the &quot;must fast-forward&quot; rule in order to
    replace the history you originally published with the rebased history. If
    somebody else built on top of your original history while you are rebasing,
    the tip of the branch at the remote may advance with her commit, and blindly
    pushing with <b>--force</b> will lose her work.</p>
<p class="Pp">This option allows you to say that you expect the history you are
    updating is what you rebased and want to replace. If the remote ref still
    points at the commit you specified, you can be sure that no other people did
    anything to the ref. It is like taking a &quot;lease&quot; on the ref
    without explicitly locking it, and the remote ref is updated only if the
    &quot;lease&quot; is still valid.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--force-with-lease</b> alone, without specifying the details,
    will protect all remote refs that are going to be updated by requiring their
    current value to be the same as the remote-tracking branch we have for
  them.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;</b>, without specifying the
    expected value, will protect the named ref (alone), if it is going to be
    updated, by requiring its current value to be the same as the
    remote-tracking branch we have for it.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</b> will
    protect the named ref (alone), if it is going to be updated, by requiring
    its current value to be the same as the specified value
    <b>&lt;expect&gt;</b> (which is allowed to be different from the
    remote-tracking branch we have for the refname, or we do not even have to
    have such a remote-tracking branch when this form is used). If
    <b>&lt;expect&gt;</b> is the empty string, then the named ref must not
    already exist.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that all forms other than
    <b>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</b> that specifies the
    expected current value of the ref explicitly are still experimental and
    their semantics may change as we gain experience with this feature.</p>
<p class="Pp">&quot;--no-force-with-lease&quot; will cancel all the previous
    --force-with-lease on the command line.</p>
<p class="Pp">A general note on safety: supplying this option without an
    expected value, i.e. as <b>--force-with-lease</b> or
    <b>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;</b> interacts very badly with anything
    that implicitly runs <b>git fetch</b> on the remote to be pushed to in the
    background, e.g. <b>git fetch origin</b> on your repository in a
  cronjob.</p>
<p class="Pp">The protection it offers over <b>--force</b> is ensuring that
    subsequent changes your work wasn&#x2019;t based on aren&#x2019;t clobbered,
    but this is trivially defeated if some background process is updating refs
    in the background. We don&#x2019;t have anything except the remote tracking
    info to go by as a heuristic for refs you&#x2019;re expected to have seen
    &amp; are willing to clobber.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your editor or some other system is running <b>git fetch</b> in
    the background for you a way to mitigate this is to simply set up another
    remote:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git remote add origin-push $(git config remote.origin.url)
git fetch origin-push
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Now when the background process runs <b>git fetch origin</b> the
    references on <b>origin-push</b> won&#x2019;t be updated, and thus commands
    like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git push --force-with-lease origin-push
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Will fail unless you manually run <b>git fetch origin-push</b>.
    This method is of course entirely defeated by something that runs <b>git
    fetch --all</b>, in that case you&#x2019;d need to either disable it or do
    something more tedious like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git fetch              # update 'master' from remote
git tag base master    # mark our base point
git rebase -i master   # rewrite some commits
git push --force-with-lease=master:base master:master
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">I.e. create a <b>base</b> tag for versions of the upstream code
    that you&#x2019;ve seen and are willing to overwrite, then rewrite history,
    and finally force push changes to <b>master</b> if the remote version is
    still at <b>base</b>, regardless of what your local
    <b>remotes/origin/master</b> has been updated to in the background.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, specifying <b>--force-if-includes</b> as an
    ancillary option along with <b>--force-with-lease[=&lt;refname&gt;]</b>
    (i.e., without saying what exact commit the ref on the remote side must be
    pointing at, or which refs on the remote side are being protected) at the
    time of &quot;push&quot; will verify if updates from the remote-tracking
    refs that may have been implicitly updated in the background are integrated
    locally before allowing a forced update.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-f, --force</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Usually, the command refuses to update a remote ref that
  is not an ancestor of the local ref used to overwrite it. Also, when
  <b>--force-with-lease</b> option is used, the command refuses to update a
  remote ref whose current value does not match what is expected.
<p class="Pp">This flag disables these checks, and can cause the remote
    repository to lose commits; use it with care.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that <b>--force</b> applies to all the refs that are pushed,
    hence using it with <b>push.default</b> set to <b>matching</b> or with
    multiple push destinations configured with <b>remote.*.push</b> may
    overwrite refs other than the current branch (including local refs that are
    strictly behind their remote counterpart). To force a push to only one
    branch, use a <b>+</b> in front of the refspec to push (e.g <b>git push
    origin +master</b> to force a push to the <b>master</b> branch). See the
    <b>&lt;refspec&gt;...</b> section above for details.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]force-if-includes</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Force an update only if the tip of the remote-tracking
  ref has been integrated locally.
<p class="Pp">This option enables a check that verifies if the tip of the
    remote-tracking ref is reachable from one of the &quot;reflog&quot; entries
    of the local branch based in it for a rewrite. The check ensures that any
    updates from the remote have been incorporated locally by rejecting the
    forced update if that is not the case.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the option is passed without specifying
    <b>--force-with-lease</b>, or specified along with
    <b>--force-with-lease=&lt;refname&gt;:&lt;expect&gt;</b>, it is a
    &quot;no-op&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Specifying <b>--no-force-if-includes</b> disables this
  behavior.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--repo=&lt;repository&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is equivalent to the &lt;repository&gt;
  argument. If both are specified, the command-line argument takes
  precedence.</div>
<p class="Pp">-u, --set-upstream</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For every branch that is up to date or successfully
  pushed, add upstream (tracking) reference, used by argument-less
  <b>git-pull</b>(1) and other commands. For more information, see
  <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</b> in <b>git-config</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]thin</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">These options are passed to <b>git-send-pack</b>(1). A
  thin transfer significantly reduces the amount of sent data when the sender
  and receiver share many of the same objects in common. The default is
  <b>--thin</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-q, --quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Suppress all output, including the listing of updated
  refs, unless an error occurs. Progress is not reported to the standard error
  stream.</div>
<p class="Pp">-v, --verbose</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Run verbosely.</div>
<p class="Pp">--progress</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Progress status is reported on the standard error stream
  by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is specified. This
  flag forces progress status even if the standard error stream is not directed
  to a terminal.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-recurse-submodules,
    --recurse-submodules=check|on-demand|only|no</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">May be used to make sure all submodule commits used by
  the revisions to be pushed are available on a remote-tracking branch. If
  <i>check</i> is used Git will verify that all submodule commits that changed
  in the revisions to be pushed are available on at least one remote of the
  submodule. If any commits are missing the push will be aborted and exit with
  non-zero status. If <i>on-demand</i> is used all submodules that changed in
  the revisions to be pushed will be pushed. If on-demand was not able to push
  all necessary revisions it will also be aborted and exit with non-zero status.
  If <i>only</i> is used all submodules will be recursively pushed while the
  superproject is left unpushed. A value of <i>no</i> or using
  <b>--no-recurse-submodules</b> can be used to override the
  push.recurseSubmodules configuration variable when no submodule recursion is
  required.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]verify</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Toggle the pre-push hook (see <b>githooks</b>(5)). The
  default is --verify, giving the hook a chance to prevent the push. With
  --no-verify, the hook is bypassed completely.</div>
<p class="Pp">-4, --ipv4</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use IPv4 addresses only, ignoring IPv6 addresses.</div>
<p class="Pp">-6, --ipv6</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use IPv6 addresses only, ignoring IPv4 addresses.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="GIT_URLS"><a class="permalink" href="#GIT_URLS">GIT
  URLS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol,
    the address of the remote server, and the path to the repository. Depending
    on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent.</p>
<p class="Pp">Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition,
    ftp, and ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and
    deprecated; do not use it).</p>
<p class="Pp">The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and
    should be used with caution on unsecured networks.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following syntaxes may be used with them:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp">An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh
    protocol:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;[user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp">This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the
    first colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a colon.
    For example the local path <b>foo:bar</b> could be specified as an absolute
    path or <b>./foo:bar</b> to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh url.</p>
<p class="Pp">The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~username

<p class="Pp">For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the

<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;file:///path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp">These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning,
    when the former implies --local option. See <b>git-clone</b>(1) for
  details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>git clone</i>, <i>git fetch</i> and <i>git pull</i>, but not
    <i>git push</i>, will also accept a suitable bundle file. See
    <b>git-bundle</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">When Git doesn&#x2019;t know how to handle a certain transport
    protocol, it attempts to use the <i>remote-&lt;transport&gt;</i> remote
    helper, if one exists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the following
    syntax may be used:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&lt;transport&gt;::&lt;address&gt;</div>
<p class="Pp">where &lt;address&gt; may be a path, a server and path, or an
    arbitrary URL-like string recognized by the specific remote helper being
    invoked. See <b>gitremote-helpers</b>(7) for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories
    and you want to use a different format for them (such that the URLs you use
    will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration
    section of the form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        [url &quot;&lt;actual url base&gt;&quot;]
                insteadOf = &lt;other url base&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">For example, with this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        [url &quot;git://git.host.xz/&quot;]
                insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
                insteadOf = work:
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">a URL like &quot;work:repo.git&quot; or like
    &quot;host.xz:/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be rewritten in any context that
    takes a URL to be &quot;git://git.host.xz/repo.git&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a
    configuration section of the form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        [url &quot;&lt;actual url base&gt;&quot;]
                pushInsteadOf = &lt;other url base&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">For example, with this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        [url &quot;ssh://example.org/&quot;]
                pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">a URL like &quot;git://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot; will be
    rewritten to &quot;ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git&quot; for pushes, but
    pulls will still use the original URL.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTE_ABOUT_FAST"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTE_ABOUT_FAST">NOTE
  ABOUT FAST-FORWARDS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When an update changes a branch (or more in general, a ref) that
    used to point at commit A to point at another commit B, it is called a
    fast-forward update if and only if B is a descendant of A.</p>
<p class="Pp">In a fast-forward update from A to B, the set of commits that the
    original commit A built on top of is a subset of the commits the new commit
    B builds on top of. Hence, it does not lose any history.</p>
<p class="Pp">In contrast, a non-fast-forward update will lose history. For
    example, suppose you and somebody else started at the same commit X, and you
    built a history leading to commit B while the other person built a history
    leading to commit A. The history looks like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
      B
     /
 ---X---A
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Further suppose that the other person already pushed changes
    leading to A back to the original repository from which you two obtained the
    original commit X.</p>
<p class="Pp">The push done by the other person updated the branch that used to
    point at commit X to point at commit A. It is a fast-forward.</p>
<p class="Pp">But if you try to push, you will attempt to update the branch
    (that now points at A) with commit B. This does <i>not</i> fast-forward. If
    you did so, the changes introduced by commit A will be lost, because
    everybody will now start building on top of B.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command by default does not allow an update that is not a
    fast-forward to prevent such loss of history.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you do not want to lose your work (history from X to B) or the
    work by the other person (history from X to A), you would need to first
    fetch the history from the repository, create a history that contains
    changes done by both parties, and push the result back.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can perform &quot;git pull&quot;, resolve potential conflicts,
    and &quot;git push&quot; the result. A &quot;git pull&quot; will create a
    merge commit C between commits A and B.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
      B---C
     /   /
 ---X---A
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Updating A with the resulting merge commit will fast-forward and
    your push will be accepted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, you can rebase your change between X and B on top
    of A, with &quot;git pull --rebase&quot;, and push the result back. The
    rebase will create a new commit D that builds the change between X and B on
    top of A.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
      B   D
     /   /
 ---X---A
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Again, updating A with this commit will fast-forward and your push
    will be accepted.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is another common situation where you may encounter
    non-fast-forward rejection when you try to push, and it is possible even
    when you are pushing into a repository nobody else pushes into. After you
    push commit A yourself (in the first picture in this section), replace it
    with &quot;git commit --amend&quot; to produce commit B, and you try to push
    it out, because forgot that you have pushed A out already. In such a case,
    and only if you are certain that nobody in the meantime fetched your earlier
    commit A (and started building on top of it), you can run &quot;git push
    --force&quot; to overwrite it. In other words, &quot;git push --force&quot;
    is a method reserved for a case where you do mean to lose history.</p>

<p class="Pp">The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side
    from stealing data from the other repository that was not intended to be
    shared. If you have private data that you need to protect from a malicious
    peer, your best option is to store it in another repository. This applies to
    both clients and servers. In particular, namespaces on a server are not
    effective for read access control; you should only grant read access to a
    namespace to clients that you would trust with read access to the entire
    repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">The known attack vectors are as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.The victim sends &quot;have&quot; lines advertising
  the IDs of objects it has that are not explicitly intended to be shared but
  can be used to optimize the transfer if the peer also has them. The attacker
  chooses an object ID X to steal and sends a ref to X, but isn&#x2019;t
  required to send the content of X because the victim already has it. Now the
  victim believes that the attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back to
  the attacker later. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to
  perform on a server, by creating a ref to X in the namespace the client has
  access to and then fetching it. The most likely way for a server to perform it
  on a client is to &quot;merge&quot; X into a public branch and hope that the
  user does additional work on this branch and pushes it back to the server
  without noticing the merge.)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to
  steal. The victim sends an object Y that the attacker already has, and the
  attacker falsely claims to have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a delta
  against X. The delta reveals regions of X that are similar to Y to the
  attacker.</div>
