<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">leave</code> utility waits until the
    specified time, then reminds you that you have to leave. You are reminded 5
    minutes and 1 minute before the actual time, at the time, and every minute
    thereafter. When you log off, <code class="Nm">leave</code> exits just
    before it would have printed the next message.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following options are available:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><var class="Ar">hhmm</var></dt>
  <dd>The time of day is in the form <var class="Ar">hhmm</var> where
      <var class="Ar">hh</var> is a time in hours (on a 12 or 24 hour clock),
      and <var class="Ar">mm</var> are minutes. All times are converted to a 12
      hour clock, and assumed to be in the next 12 hours.</dd>
  <dt id="+"><a class="permalink" href="#+"><code class="Cm">+</code></a></dt>
  <dd>If the time is preceded by &#x2018;<code class="Cm">+</code>&#x2019;, the
      alarm will go off in hours and minutes from the current time.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If no argument is given, <code class="Nm">leave</code> prompts
    with &quot;When do you have to leave?&quot;. A reply of newline causes
    <code class="Nm">leave</code> to exit, otherwise the reply is assumed to be
    a time. This form is suitable for inclusion in a
    <span class="Pa">.login</span> or <span class="Pa">.profile</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">To get rid of <code class="Nm">leave</code> you should either log
    off or use &#x2018;<code class="Li">kill -s KILL</code>&#x2019; giving its
