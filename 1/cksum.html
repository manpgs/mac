<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">cksum</code> utility writes to the standard
    output three whitespace separated fields for each input file. These fields
    are a checksum CRC, the total number of octets in the file and the file
    name. If no file name is specified, the standard input is used and no file
    name is written.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">sum</code> utility is identical to the
    <code class="Nm">cksum</code> utility, except that it defaults to using
    historic algorithm 1, as described below. It is provided for compatibility
    only.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="o"><a class="permalink" href="#o"><code class="Fl">-o</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Use historic algorithms instead of the (superior) default one.
    <p class="Pp">Algorithm 1 is the algorithm used by historic
        <span class="Ux">BSD</span> systems as the
        <a class="Xr" href="../1/sum">sum(1)</a> algorithm and by historic
        <span class="Ux">AT&amp;T System&#x00A0;V UNIX</span> systems as the
        <a class="Xr" href="../1/sum">sum(1)</a> algorithm when using the
        <code class="Fl">-r</code> option. This is a 16-bit checksum, with a
        right rotation before each addition; overflow is discarded.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Algorithm 2 is the algorithm used by historic
        <span class="Ux">AT&amp;T System&#x00A0;V UNIX</span> systems as the
        default <a class="Xr" href="../1/sum">sum(1)</a> algorithm. This is a
        32-bit checksum, and is defined as follows:</p>
    <div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
    <pre>s = sum of all bytes;
r = s % 2^16 + (s % 2^32) / 2^16;
cksum = (r % 2^16) + r / 2^16;</pre>
    </div>
    <p class="Pp">Algorithm 3 is what is commonly called the
        &#x2018;<code class="Li">32bit CRC</code>&#x2019; algorithm. This is a
        32-bit checksum.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Both algorithm 1 and 2 write to the standard output the same
        fields as the default algorithm except that the size of the file in
        bytes is replaced with the size of the file in blocks. For historic
        reasons, the block size is 1024 for algorithm 1 and 512 for algorithm 2.
        Partial blocks are rounded up.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The default CRC used is based on the polynomial used for CRC error
    checking in the networking standard <span class="St">ISO 8802-3:
    1989</span>. The CRC checksum encoding is defined by the generating
    polynomial:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>G(x) = x^32 + x^26 + x^23 + x^22 + x^16 + x^12 +
     x^11 + x^10 + x^8 + x^7 + x^5 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Mathematically, the CRC value corresponding to a given file is
    defined by the following procedure:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">The <var class="Ar">n</var> bits to be evaluated
  are considered to be the coefficients of a mod 2 polynomial M(x) of degree
  <var class="Ar">n</var>-1. These <var class="Ar">n</var> bits are the bits
  from the file, with the most significant bit being the most significant bit of
  the first octet of the file and the last bit being the least significant bit
  of the last octet, padded with zero bits (if necessary) to achieve an integral
  number of octets, followed by one or more octets representing the length of
  the file as a binary value, least significant octet first. The smallest number
  of octets capable of representing this integer are used.
<p class="Pp">M(x) is multiplied by x^32 (i.e., shifted left 32 bits) and
    divided by G(x) using mod 2 division, producing a remainder R(x) of degree
    &lt;= 31.</p>
<p class="Pp">The coefficients of R(x) are considered to be a 32-bit
  sequence.</p>
<p class="Pp">The bit sequence is complemented and the result is the CRC.</p>
