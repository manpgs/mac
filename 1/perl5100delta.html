<p class="Pp">Many of the bug fixes in 5.10.0 were already seen in the 5.8.X
    maintenance releases; they are not duplicated here and are documented in the

  &quot;feature&quot; pragma</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;feature&quot;</span> pragma is used to
    enable new syntax that would break Perl's backwards-compatibility with older
    releases of the language. It's a lexical pragma, like
    <span class="Li">&quot;strict&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Currently the following new features are available:
    <span class="Li">&quot;switch&quot;</span> (adds a switch statement),
    <span class="Li">&quot;say&quot;</span> (adds a
    <span class="Li">&quot;say&quot;</span> built-in function), and
    <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span> (adds a
    <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span> keyword for declaring
    &quot;static&quot; variables). Those features are described in their own
    sections of this document.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;feature&quot;</span> pragma is also
    implicitly loaded when you require a minimal perl version (with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;use VERSION&quot;</span> construct) greater than, or
    equal to, 5.9.5. See feature for details.</p>

<p class="Pp">A new operator <span class="Li">&quot;//&quot;</span> (defined-or)
    has been implemented. The following expression:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $a // $b
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is merely equivalent to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>   $c = $d unless defined $c;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;//&quot;</span> operator has the same
    precedence and associativity as <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span>.
    Special care has been taken to ensure that this operator Do What You Mean

<p class="Pp">Perl 5 now has a switch statement. It's available when
    <span class="Li">&quot;use feature</span>
    <span class="Li">'switch'&quot;</span> is in effect. This feature introduces
    three new keywords, <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    given ($foo) {

<p class="Pp">A more complete description of how Perl matches the switch
    variable against the <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> conditions is
    given in &quot;Switch statements&quot; in perlsyn.</p>
<p class="Pp">This kind of match is called <i>smart match</i>, and it's also
    possible to use it outside of switch statements, via the new

  <dt id="Recursive"><a class="permalink" href="#Recursive">Recursive
    Patterns</a></dt>
  <dd>It is now possible to write recursive patterns without using the
      <span class="Li">&quot;(??{})&quot;</span> construct. This new way is more
      efficient, and in many cases easier to read.
    <p class="Pp">Each capturing parenthesis can now be treated as an
        independent pattern that can be entered by using the
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?PARNO)&quot;</span> syntax
        (<span class="Li">&quot;PARNO&quot;</span> standing for
        &quot;parenthesis number&quot;). For example, the following pattern will
        match nested balanced angle brackets:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    /
     ^                      # start of line
     (                      # start capture buffer 1
        &lt;                   #   match an opening angle bracket
        (?:                 #   match one of:
            (?&gt;             #     don't backtrack over the inside of this group
                [^&lt;&gt;]+      #       one or more non angle brackets
            )               #     end non backtracking group
        |                   #     ... or ...
            (?1)            #     recurse to bracket 1 and try it again
        )*                  #   0 or more times.
        &gt;                   #   match a closing angle bracket
     )                      # end capture buffer one
     $                      # end of line
    /x
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">PCRE users should note that Perl's recursive regex feature
        allows backtracking into a recursed pattern, whereas in PCRE the
        recursion is atomic or &quot;possessive&quot; in nature. As in the
        example above, you can add (?&gt;) to control this selectively. (Yves
        Orton)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Named"><a class="permalink" href="#Named">Named Capture
    Buffers</a></dt>
  <dd>It is now possible to name capturing parenthesis in a pattern and refer to
      the captured contents by name. The naming syntax is
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?&lt;NAME&gt;....)&quot;</span>. It's possible to
      backreference to a named buffer with the
      <span class="Li">&quot;\k&lt;NAME&gt;&quot;</span> syntax. In code, the
      new magical hashes <span class="Li">&quot;%+&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;%-&quot;</span> can be used to access the contents
      of the capture buffers.
    <p class="Pp">Thus, to replace all doubled chars with a single copy, one
        could write</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    s/(?&lt;letter&gt;.)\k&lt;letter&gt;/$+{letter}/g
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Only buffers with defined contents will be &quot;visible&quot;
        in the <span class="Li">&quot;%+&quot;</span> hash, so it's possible to
        do something like</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    foreach my $name (keys %+) {
        print &quot;content of buffer '$name' is $+{$name}\n&quot;;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;%-&quot;</span> hash is a bit more
        complete, since it will contain array refs holding values from all
        capture buffers similarly named, if there should be many of them.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;%+&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;%-&quot;</span> are implemented as tied hashes
        through the new module
        <span class="Li">&quot;Tie::Hash::NamedCapture&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Users exposed to the .NET regex engine will find that the perl
        implementation differs in that the numerical ordering of the buffers is
        sequential, and not &quot;unnamed first, then named&quot;. Thus in the
        pattern</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   /(A)(?&lt;B&gt;B)(C)(?&lt;D&gt;D)/
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">$1</span> will be 'A',
        <span class="Li">$2</span> will be 'B', <span class="Li">$3</span> will
        be 'C' and <span class="Li">$4</span> will be 'D' and not
        <span class="Li">$1</span> is 'A', <span class="Li">$2</span> is 'C' and
        <span class="Li">$3</span> is 'B' and <span class="Li">$4</span> is 'D'
        that a .NET programmer would expect. This is considered a feature. :-)

  <dt id="Possessive"><a class="permalink" href="#Possessive">Possessive
    Quantifiers</a></dt>
  <dd>Perl now supports the &quot;possessive quantifier&quot; syntax of the
      &quot;atomic match&quot; pattern. Basically a possessive quantifier
      matches as much as it can and never gives any back. Thus it can be used to
      control backtracking. The syntax is similar to non-greedy matching, except
      instead of using a '?' as the modifier the '+' is used. Thus
      <span class="Li">&quot;?+&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;*+&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;++&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;{min,max}+&quot;</span> are now legal quantifiers.
      (Yves Orton)</dd>
  <dt id="Backtracking"><a class="permalink" href="#Backtracking">Backtracking
    control verbs</a></dt>
  <dd>The regex engine now supports a number of special-purpose backtrack
      control verbs: (*THEN), (*PRUNE), (*MARK), (*SKIP), (*COMMIT), (*FAIL) and
      (*ACCEPT). See perlre for their descriptions. (Yves Orton)</dd>
  <dt id="Relative"><a class="permalink" href="#Relative">Relative
    backreferences</a></dt>
  <dd>A new syntax <span class="Li">&quot;\g{N}&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\gN&quot;</span> where &quot;N&quot; is a decimal
      integer allows a safer form of back-reference notation as well as allowing
      relative backreferences. This should make it easier to generate and embed
      patterns that contain backreferences. See &quot;Capture buffers&quot; in
      perlre. (Yves Orton)</dd>
  <dt>&quot;\K&quot; escape</dt>
  <dd>The functionality of Jeff Pinyan's module Regexp::Keep has been added to
      the core. In regular expressions you can now use the special escape
      <span class="Li">&quot;\K&quot;</span> as a way to do something like
      floating length positive lookbehind. It is also useful in substitutions
      like:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  s/(foo)bar/$1/g
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">that can now be converted to</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  s/foo\Kbar//g
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">which is much more efficient. (Yves Orton)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Vertical"><a class="permalink" href="#Vertical">Vertical and
    horizontal whitespace, and linebreak</a></dt>
  <dd>Regular expressions now recognize the
      <span class="Li">&quot;\v&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;\h&quot;</span> escapes that match vertical and
      horizontal whitespace, respectively.
      <span class="Li">&quot;\V&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;\H&quot;</span> logically match their complements.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;\R&quot;</span> matches a generic
        linebreak, that is, vertical whitespace, plus the multi-character
        sequence <span class="Li">&quot;\x0D\x0A&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Optional"><a class="permalink" href="#Optional">Optional pre-match and
    post-match captures with the /p flag</a></dt>
  <dd>There is a new flag <span class="Li">&quot;/p&quot;</span> for regular
      expressions. Using this makes the engine preserve a copy of the part of
      the matched string before the matching substring to the new special
      variable <span class="Li">&quot;${^PREMATCH}&quot;</span>, the part after
      the matching substring to
      <span class="Li">&quot;${^POSTMATCH}&quot;</span>, and the matched
      substring itself to <span class="Li">&quot;${^MATCH}&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Perl is still able to store these substrings to the special
        variables <span class="Li">&quot;$`&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;$'&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">$&amp;</span>,
        but using these variables anywhere in the program adds a penalty to all
        regular expression matches, whereas if you use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;/p&quot;</span> flag and the new special
        variables instead, you pay only for the regular expressions where the
        flag is used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For more detail on the new variables, see perlvar; for the use
        of the regular expression flag, see perlop and perlre.</p>

  simple</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $_;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The operations that default on <span class="Li">$_</span> will use
    the lexically-scoped version of <span class="Li">$_</span> when it exists,
    instead of the global <span class="Li">$_</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In a <span class="Li">&quot;map&quot;</span> or a
    <span class="Li">&quot;grep&quot;</span> block, if
    <span class="Li">$_</span> was previously my'ed, then the
    <span class="Li">$_</span> inside the block is lexical as well (and scoped
    to the block).</p>
<p class="Pp">In a scope where <span class="Li">$_</span> has been lexicalized,
    you can still have access to the global version of
    <span class="Li">$_</span> by using <span class="Li">$::_</span>, or, more

<p class="Pp">This has a small incompatible consequence: the <b>prototype()</b>

<p class="Pp">Note that, due to changes in the implementation of class hierarchy

    side-effect of removing the magic on the <span class="Li">@ISA</span> array
    and should not have been done in the first place. Also, the cache

<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;UNIVERSAL&quot;</span> class has a new

<h2 class="Ss" id="Packing_and_"><a class="permalink" href="#Packing_and_">Packing
  and UTF-8 strings</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The semantics of <b>pack()</b> and <b>unpack()</b> regarding
    UTF-8-encoded data has been changed. Processing is now by default character
    per character instead of byte per byte on the underlying encoding. Notably,
    code that used things like <span class="Li">&quot;pack(&quot;a*&quot;,
    $string)&quot;</span> to see through the encoding of string will now simply
    get back the original <span class="Li">$string</span>. Packed strings can
    also get upgraded during processing when you store upgraded characters. You
    can get the old behaviour by using <span class="Li">&quot;use
    bytes&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">To be consistent with <b>pack()</b>, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;C0&quot;</span> in <b>unpack()</b> templates
    indicates that the data is to be processed in character mode, i.e. character
    by character; on the contrary, <span class="Li">&quot;U0&quot;</span> in
    <b>unpack()</b> indicates UTF-8 mode, where the packed string is processed
    in its UTF-8-encoded Unicode form on a byte by byte basis. This is reversed
    with regard to perl 5.8.X, but now consistent between <b>pack()</b> and
    <b>unpack()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Moreover, <span class="Li">&quot;C0&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;U0&quot;</span> can also be used in <b>pack()</b>
    templates to specify respectively character and byte modes.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;C0&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;U0&quot;</span> in the middle of a pack or unpack
    format now switch to the specified encoding mode, honoring parens grouping.
    Previously, parens were ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also, there is a new <b>pack()</b> character format,
    <span class="Li">&quot;W&quot;</span>, which is intended to replace the old
    <span class="Li">&quot;C&quot;</span>. <span class="Li">&quot;C&quot;</span>
    is kept for unsigned chars coded as bytes in the strings internal
    representation. <span class="Li">&quot;W&quot;</span> represents unsigned
    (logical) character values, which can be greater than 255. It is therefore
    more robust when dealing with potentially UTF-8-encoded data (as
    <span class="Li">&quot;C&quot;</span> will wrap values outside the range
    0..255, and not respect the string encoding).</p>
<p class="Pp">In practice, that means that pack formats are now
    encoding-neutral, except <span class="Li">&quot;C&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For consistency, <span class="Li">&quot;A&quot;</span> in
    <b>unpack()</b> format now trims all Unicode whitespace from the end of the
    string. Before perl 5.9.2, it used to strip only the classical ASCII space
    characters.</p>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;encoding::warnings&quot;</span>, by Audrey Tang, is
      a module to emit warnings whenever an ASCII character string containing
      high-bit bytes is implicitly converted into UTF-8. It's a lexical pragma
      since Perl 5.9.4; on older perls, its effect is global.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Module::CoreList&quot;</span>, by Richard Clamp, is
      a small handy module that tells you what versions of core modules ship
      with any versions of Perl 5. It comes with a command-line frontend,
      <span class="Li">&quot;corelist&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Math::BigInt::FastCalc&quot;</span> is an
      XS-enabled, and thus faster, version of
      <span class="Li">&quot;Math::BigInt::Calc&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Compress::Zlib&quot;</span> is an interface to the
      zlib compression library. It comes with a bundled version of zlib, so
      having a working zlib is not a prerequisite to install it. It's used by
      <span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar&quot;</span> (see below).</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;IO::Zlib&quot;</span> is an
      <span class="Li">&quot;IO::&quot;</span>-style interface to
      <span class="Li">&quot;Compress::Zlib&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Tar&quot;</span> is a module to manipulate
      <span class="Li">&quot;tar&quot;</span> archives.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Digest::SHA&quot;</span> is a module used to
      calculate many types of SHA digests, has been included for SHA support in
      the CPAN module.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::CBuilder&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::ParseXS&quot;</span> have been
    added.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Hash::Util::FieldHash&quot;</span>, by Anno Siegel,
      has been added. This module provides support for <i>field hashes</i>:
      hashes that maintain an association of a reference with a value, in a
      thread-safe garbage-collected way. Such hashes are useful to implement
      inside-out objects.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Module::Build&quot;</span>, by Ken Williams, has
      been added. It's an alternative to
      <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::MakeMaker&quot;</span> to build and
      install perl modules.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Module::Load&quot;</span>, by Jos Boumans, has been
      added. It provides a single interface to load Perl modules and <i>.pl</i>
      files.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Module::Loaded&quot;</span>, by Jos Boumans, has
      been added. It's used to mark modules as loaded or unloaded.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Package::Constants&quot;</span>, by Jos Boumans,
      has been added. It's a simple helper to list all constants declared in a
      given package.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Win32API::File&quot;</span>, by Tye McQueen, has
      been added (for Windows builds). This module provides low-level access to
      Win32 system API calls for files/dirs.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Locale::Maketext::Simple&quot;</span>, needed by
      CPANPLUS, is a simple wrapper around
      <span class="Li">&quot;Locale::Maketext::Lexicon&quot;</span>. Note that
      <span class="Li">&quot;Locale::Maketext::Lexicon&quot;</span> isn't
      included in the perl core; the behaviour of
      <span class="Li">&quot;Locale::Maketext::Simple&quot;</span> gracefully
      degrades when the later isn't present.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Params::Check&quot;</span> implements a generic
      input parsing/checking mechanism. It is used by CPANPLUS.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Term::UI&quot;</span> simplifies the task to ask
      questions at a terminal prompt.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Object::Accessor&quot;</span> provides an interface
      to create per-object accessors.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Module::Pluggable&quot;</span> is a simple
      framework to create modules that accept pluggable sub-modules.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Module::Load::Conditional&quot;</span> provides
      simple ways to query and possibly load installed modules.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Time::Piece&quot;</span> provides an object
      oriented interface to time functions, overriding the built-ins
      <b>localtime()</b> and <b>gmtime()</b>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;IPC::Cmd&quot;</span> helps to find and run
      external commands, possibly interactively.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;File::Fetch&quot;</span> provide a simple generic
      file fetching mechanism.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Log::Message&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;Log::Message::Simple&quot;</span> are used by the
      log facility of <span class="Li">&quot;CPANPLUS&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Archive::Extract&quot;</span> is a generic archive
      extraction mechanism for <i>.tar</i> (plain, gzipped or bzipped) or
      <i>.zip</i> files.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;CPANPLUS&quot;</span> provides an API and a
      command-line tool to access the CPAN mirrors.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Pod::Escapes&quot;</span> provides utilities that
      are useful in decoding Pod E&lt;...&gt; sequences.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Pod::Simple&quot;</span> is now the backend for
      several of the Pod-related modules included with Perl.</li>

<p class="Pp">The interpreter internals now support a far more memory efficient
    form of inlineable constants. Storing a reference to a constant value in a
    symbol table is equivalent to a full typeglob referencing a constant
    subroutine, but using about 400 bytes less memory. This proxy constant
    subroutine is automatically upgraded to a real typeglob with subroutine if
    necessary. The approach taken is analogous to the existing space
    optimisation for subroutine stub declarations, which are stored as plain
    scalars in place of the full typeglob.</p>
<p class="Pp">Several of the core modules have been converted to use this
    feature for their system dependent constants - as a result

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Engine"><a class="permalink" href="#Engine">Engine
    de-recursivised</a></dt>
  <dd>The regular expression engine is no longer recursive, meaning that
      patterns that used to overflow the stack will either die with useful
      explanations, or run to completion, which, since they were able to blow
      the stack before, will likely take a very long time to happen. If you were
      experiencing the occasional stack overflow (or segfault) and upgrade to

      regex. (Dave Mitchell)</dd>
  <dt id="Single"><a class="permalink" href="#Single">Single char char-classes

  <dd>Classes of a single character are now treated the same as if the character
      had been used as a literal, meaning that code that uses char-classes as an
      escaping mechanism will see a speedup. (Yves Orton)</dd>
  <dt id="Trie"><a class="permalink" href="#Trie">Trie optimisation of literal
    string alternations</a></dt>
  <dd>Alternations, where possible, are optimised into more efficient matching
      structures. String literal alternations are merged into a trie and are
      matched simultaneously. This means that instead of O(N) time for matching
      N alternations at a given point, the new code performs in O(1) time. A new
      special variable, ${^RE_TRIE_MAXBUF}, has been added to fine-tune this
      optimization. (Yves Orton)
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note:</b> Much code exists that works around perl's
        historic poor performance on alternations. Often the tricks used to do
        so will disable the new optimisations. Hopefully the utility modules
        used for this purpose will be educated about these new
      optimisations.</p>

    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;threads&quot;</span> is now a dual-life

  <dt id="Overloading"><a class="permalink" href="#Overloading">Overloading and

  <dd>Overloading now works when references are reblessed into another class.
      Internally, this has been implemented by moving the flag for
      &quot;overloading&quot; from the reference to the referent, which
      logically is where it should always have been. (Nicholas Clark)</dd>

  <dd>Traditionally, <span class="Li">&quot;eval 'syntax error'&quot;</span> has

      or reduced. (Dave Mitchell)</dd>
  <dt id="Random"><a class="permalink" href="#Random">Random device on

  <dd>In previous versions, perl would read the file <i>/dev/urandom</i> if it
      existed when seeding its random number generator. That file is unlikely to

    <p class="Pp">Moreover, with a thread-enabled perl, using
        <span class="Li">&quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot;</span> could lead to an

    Hietaniemi)</dd>
  <dt id="study()"><a class="permalink" href="#study()"><b>study()</b> and

  <dd><b>study()</b> never worked for UTF-8 strings, but could lead to false

      &quot;Deferred Signals (Safe Signals)&quot; in perlipc). (Rafael)</dd>
  <dt>@INC-hook fix</dt>
  <dd>When a module or a file is loaded through an
      <span class="Li">@INC</span>-hook, and when this hook has set a filename
      entry in <span class="Li">%INC</span>, __FILE__ is now set for this module
      accordingly to the contents of that <span class="Li">%INC</span> entry.

  <dt>&quot;-t&quot; switch fix</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;-w&quot;</span> and

<p class="Pp">In general, the source code of perl has been refactored, tidied

<p class="Pp">When compiling the perl core with gcc, as many gcc warning flags
    are turned on as is possible on the platform. (This quest for cleanliness
    doesn't extend to XS code because we cannot guarantee the tidiness of code
    we didn't write.) Similar strictness flags have been added or tightened for
