<h2 class="Ss" id="New_bitwise_operators"><a class="permalink" href="#New_bitwise_operators">New
  bitwise operators</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A new experimental facility has been added that makes the four
    standard bitwise operators (<span class="Li">&quot;&amp; | ^ ~&quot;</span>)
    treat their operands consistently as numbers, and introduces four new dotted
    operators (<span class="Li">&quot;&amp;. |. ^. ~.&quot;</span>) that treat
    their operands consistently as strings. The same applies to the assignment
    variants (<span class="Li">&quot;&amp;= |= ^= &amp;.= |.=
  ^.=&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">To use this, enable the &quot;bitwise&quot; feature and disable
    the &quot;experimental::bitwise&quot; warnings category. See &quot;Bitwise
    String Operators&quot; in perlop for details. [perl #123466]

    <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> to open each file in
    <span class="Li">@ARGV</span>. This means that each element of

<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>&quot;qr/\b{gcb}/&quot;</i><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;gcb&quot;</span> stands for Grapheme
    Cluster Boundary. It is a Unicode property that finds the boundary between
    sequences of characters that look like a single character to a native
    speaker of a language. Perl has long had the ability to deal with these
    through the <span class="Li">&quot;\X&quot;</span> regular escape sequence.
    Now, there is an alternative way of handling these. See &quot;\b{}, \b,
    \B{}, \B&quot; in perlrebackslash for details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>&quot;qr/\b{wb}/&quot;</i><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;wb&quot;</span> stands for Word Boundary.
    It is a Unicode property that finds the boundary between words. This is
    similar to the plain <span class="Li">&quot;\b&quot;</span> (without braces)
    but is more suitable for natural language processing. It knows, for example,
    that apostrophes can occur in the middle of words. See &quot;\b{}, \b, \B{},
    \B&quot; in perlrebackslash for details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i></i><i>&quot;qr/\b{sb}/&quot;</i><i></i></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;sb&quot;</span> stands for Sentence
    Boundary. It is a Unicode property to aid in parsing natural language
    sentences. See &quot;\b{}, \b, \B{}, \B&quot; in perlrebackslash for

    unintentional behavior that backwards-compatibility issues prevent us from
    reporting in normal regular expression compilations. Because the behavior of
    this is subject to change in future Perl releases as we gain experience,
    using this pragma will raise a warning of category

<p class="Pp">When the relevant support is available in the operating system,

  operators now follow standard Perl precedence</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This experimental feature allows set operations in regular
    expression patterns. Prior to this, the intersection operator had the same
    precedence as the other binary operators. Now it has higher precedence. This
    could lead to different outcomes than existing code expects (though the
    documentation has always noted that this change might happen, recommending
    fully parenthesizing the expressions). See &quot;Extended Bracketed
    Character Classes&quot; in perlrecharclass.</p>

<p class="Pp">Previously, the text, unlike almost everything else, always came

<p class="Pp">The stringification of <span class="Li">$!</span> and
    <span class="Li">$^E</span> will have the UTF-8 flag set when the text is
    actually non-ASCII UTF-8. This will enable programs that are set up to be
    locale-aware to properly output messages in the user's native language. Code
    that needs to continue the 5.20 and earlier behavior can do the
    stringification within the scopes of both
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;bytes&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&#x00A0;&quot;:messages&quot;&quot;</span>.
    Within these two scopes, no other Perl operations will be affected by
    locale; only <span class="Li">$!</span> and <span class="Li">$^E</span>
    stringification. The <span class="Li">&quot;bytes&quot;</span> pragma causes

<p class="Pp">The syntax for single-character variable names is more lenient

    punctuation character or even invisible (a non-graphic). Perl v5.20
    deprecated the ASCII-range controls as such a name. Now, all non-graphic
    characters that formerly were allowed are deprecated. The practical effect
    of this occurs only when not under
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;utf8&quot;</span>, and affects just the C1
    controls (code points 0x80 through 0xFF), NO-BREAK SPACE, and SOFT

  of &quot;sub () { $var }&quot; with observable side-effects</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In many cases Perl makes
    <span class="Li">&quot;sub&#x00A0;()&#x00A0;{&#x00A0;$var&#x00A0;}&quot;</span>
    into an inlinable constant subroutine, capturing the value of
    <span class="Li">$var</span> at the time the
    <span class="Li">&quot;sub&quot;</span> expression is evaluated. This can
    break the closure behavior in those cases where <span class="Li">$var</span>
    is subsequently modified, since the subroutine won't return the changed
    value. (Note that this all only applies to anonymous subroutines with an
    empty prototype (<span class="Li">&quot;sub&#x00A0;()&quot;</span>).)</p>
<p class="Pp">This usage is now deprecated in those cases where the variable
    could be modified elsewhere. Perl detects those cases and emits a
    deprecation warning. Such code will likely change in the future and stop
    producing a constant.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your variable is only modified in the place where it is
    declared, then Perl will continue to make the sub inlinable with no
    warnings.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    sub make_constant {
        my $var = shift;
        return sub () { $var }; # fine

    sub make_constant_deprecated {
        my $var;

        log_that_value($var); # could modify $var
        return sub () { $var }; # deprecated
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In the second example above, detecting that
    <span class="Li">$var</span> is assigned to only once is too hard to detect.
    That it happens in a spot other than the
    <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span> declaration is enough for Perl to
    find it suspicious.</p>
<p class="Pp">This deprecation warning happens only for a simple variable for
    the body of the sub. (A <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span> block or
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> statement inside the sub is ignored,
    because it does not become part of the sub's body.) For more complex cases,
    such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;sub&#x00A0;()&#x00A0;{&#x00A0;do_something()&#x00A0;if&#x00A0;0;&#x00A0;$var&#x00A0;}&quot;</span>

    is modifiable elsewhere. Such cases should be rare.</p>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>If a method or class name is known at compile time, a hash is precomputed
      to speed up run-time method lookup. Also, compound method names like
      <span class="Li">&quot;SUPER::new&quot;</span> are parsed at compile time,
      to save having to parse them at run time.</li>
  <li>Array and hash lookups (especially nested ones) that use only constants or
      simple variables as keys, are now considerably faster. See &quot;Internal
      Changes&quot; for more details.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;(...)x1&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;(&quot;constant&quot;)x0&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;($scalar)x0&quot;</span> are now optimised in list
      context. If the right-hand argument is a constant 1, the repetition
      operator disappears. If the right-hand argument is a constant 0, the whole
      expression is optimised to the empty list, so long as the left-hand
      argument is a simple scalar or constant. (That is,
      <span class="Li">&quot;(foo())x0&quot;</span> is not subject to this
      optimisation.)</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;substr&quot;</span> assignment is now optimised
      into 4-argument <span class="Li">&quot;substr&quot;</span> at the end of a
      subroutine (or as the argument to
      <span class="Li">&quot;return&quot;</span>). Previously, this optimisation
      only happened in void context.</li>
  <li>In <span class="Li">&quot;\L...&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\Q...&quot;</span>, etc., the extra
      &quot;stringify&quot; op is now optimised away, making these just as fast
      as <span class="Li">&quot;lcfirst&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;quotemeta&quot;</span>, etc.</li>
  <li>Assignment to an empty list is now sometimes faster. In particular, it
      never calls <span class="Li">&quot;FETCH&quot;</span> on tied arguments on
      the right-hand side, whereas it used to sometimes.</li>
  <li>There is a performance improvement of up to 20% when
      <span class="Li">&quot;length&quot;</span> is applied to a non-magical,
      non-tied string, and either <span class="Li">&quot;use bytes&quot;</span>
      is in scope or the string doesn't use UTF-8 internally.</li>
  <li>On most perl builds with 64-bit integers, memory usage for non-magical,
      non-tied scalars containing only a floating point value has been reduced
      by between 8 and 32 bytes, depending on OS.</li>
  <li>In <span class="Li">&quot;@array = split&quot;</span>, the assignment can
      be optimized away, so that <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span>
      writes directly to the array. This optimisation was happening only for
      package arrays other than <span class="Li">@_</span>, and only sometimes.
      Now this optimisation happens almost all the time.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;join&quot;</span> is now subject to constant
      folding. So for example
      <span class="Li">&quot;join&#x00A0;&quot;-&quot;,&#x00A0;&quot;a&quot;,&#x00A0;&quot;b&quot;&quot;</span>
      is converted at compile-time to <span class="Li">&quot;a-b&quot;</span>.
      Moreover, <span class="Li">&quot;join&quot;</span> with a scalar or
      constant for the separator and a single-item list to join is simplified to
      a stringification, and the separator doesn't even get evaluated.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;qq(@array)&quot;</span> is implemented using two
      ops: a stringify op and a join op. If the
      <span class="Li">&quot;qq&quot;</span> contains nothing but a single
      array, the stringification is optimized away.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;our&#x00A0;$var&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;our($s,@a,%h)&quot;</span> in void context are no
      longer evaluated at run time. Even a whole sequence of
      <span class="Li">&quot;our&#x00A0;$foo;&quot;</span> statements will
      simply be skipped over. The same applies to
      <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span> variables.</li>
  <li>Many internal functions have been refactored to improve performance and
      reduce their memory footprints. [perl #121436]

      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121969&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;-T&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;-B&quot;</span> filetests will return sooner when
      an empty file is detected. [perl #121489]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121489&gt;</li>
  <li>Hash lookups where the key is a constant are faster.</li>
  <li>Subroutines with an empty prototype and a body containing just
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> are now eligible for inlining.
      [perl #122728]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122728&gt;</li>
  <li>Subroutines in packages no longer need to be stored in typeglobs:
      declaring a subroutine will now put a simple sub reference directly in the
      stash if possible, saving memory. The typeglob still notionally exists, so
      accessing it will cause the stash entry to be upgraded to a typeglob
      (<i>i.e.</i> this is just an internal implementation detail). This
      optimization does not currently apply to XSUBs or exported subroutines,
      and method calls will undo it, since they cache things in typeglobs. [perl
      #120441] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120441&gt;</li>
  <li>The functions
      <span class="Li">&quot;utf8::native_to_unicode()&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;utf8::unicode_to_native()&quot;</span> (see utf8)
      are now optimized out on ASCII platforms. There is now not even a minimal
      performance hit in writing code portable between ASCII and EBCDIC
      platforms.</li>
  <li>Win32 Perl uses 8 KB less of per-process memory than before for every perl
      process, because some data is now memory mapped from disk and shared
      between processes from the same perl binary.</li>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Bad symbol for scalar
    <p class="Pp">(P) An internal request asked to add a scalar entry to
        something that wasn't a symbol table entry.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Can't use a hash as a reference
    <p class="Pp">(F) You tried to use a hash as a reference, as in
        <span class="Li">&quot;%foo-&gt;{&quot;bar&quot;}&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;%$ref-&gt;{&quot;hello&quot;}&quot;</span>.
        Versions of perl &lt;= 5.6.1 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn't
        have.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Can't use an array as a reference
    <p class="Pp">(F) You tried to use an array as a reference, as in
        <span class="Li">&quot;@foo-&gt;[23]&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;@$ref-&gt;[99]&quot;</span>. Versions of perl
        &lt;= 5.6.1 used to allow this syntax, but shouldn't have.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Can't use 'defined(@array)' (Maybe you should just omit the
      <b>defined()</b>?)
    <p class="Pp">(F) <span class="Li">&quot;defined()&quot;</span> is not
        useful on arrays because it checks for an undefined <i>scalar</i> value.
        If you want to see if the array is empty, just use
        <span class="Li">&quot;if&#x00A0;(@array)&#x00A0;{&#x00A0;#&#x00A0;not&#x00A0;empty&#x00A0;}&quot;</span>
        for example.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Can't use 'defined(%hash)' (Maybe you should just omit the
      <b>defined()</b>?)
    <p class="Pp">(F) <span class="Li">&quot;defined()&quot;</span> is not
        usually right on hashes.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Although
        <span class="Li">&quot;defined&#x00A0;%hash&quot;</span> is false on a
        plain not-yet-used hash, it becomes true in several non-obvious
        circumstances, including iterators, weak references, stash names, even
        remaining true after
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&#x00A0;%hash&quot;</span>. These things
        make <span class="Li">&quot;defined&#x00A0;%hash&quot;</span> fairly
        useless in practice, so it now generates a fatal error.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a check for non-empty is what you wanted then just put it
        in boolean context (see &quot;Scalar values&quot; in perldata):</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    if (%hash) {
       # not empty
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you had
        <span class="Li">&quot;defined&#x00A0;%Foo::Bar::QUUX&quot;</span> to
        check whether such a package variable exists then that's never really
        been reliable, and isn't a good way to enquire about the features of a
        package, or whether it's loaded, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Cannot chr <span class="Li">%f</span>
    <p class="Pp">(F) You passed an invalid number (like an infinity or
        not-a-number) to <span class="Li">&quot;chr&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Cannot compress <span class="Li">%f</span> in pack
    <p class="Pp">(F) You tried converting an infinity or not-a-number to an
        unsigned character, which makes no sense.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Cannot pack <span class="Li">%f</span> with '%c'
    <p class="Pp">(F) You tried converting an infinity or not-a-number to a
        character, which makes no sense.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Cannot print <span class="Li">%f</span> with '%c'
    <p class="Pp">(F) You tried printing an infinity or not-a-number as a
        character (<span class="Li">%c</span>), which makes no sense. Maybe you
        meant <span class="Li">'%s'</span>, or just stringifying it?</p>
  </li>
  <li>charnames alias definitions may not contain a sequence of multiple spaces
    <p class="Pp">(F) You defined a character name which had multiple space
        characters in a row. Change them to single spaces. Usually these names
        are defined in the <span class="Li">&quot;:alias&quot;</span> import
        argument to <span class="Li">&quot;use charnames&quot;</span>, but they
        could be defined by a translator installed into
        <span class="Li">$^H{charnames}</span>. See &quot;CUSTOM ALIASES&quot;
        in charnames.</p>
  </li>
  <li>charnames alias definitions may not contain trailing white-space
    <p class="Pp">(F) You defined a character name which ended in a space
        character. Remove the trailing space(s). Usually these names are defined
        in the <span class="Li">&quot;:alias&quot;</span> import argument to
        <span class="Li">&quot;use charnames&quot;</span>, but they could be
        defined by a translator installed into
        <span class="Li">$^H{charnames}</span>. See &quot;CUSTOM ALIASES&quot;
        in charnames.</p>
  </li>
  <li>:const is not permitted on named subroutines
    <p class="Pp">(F) The <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span> attribute
        causes an anonymous subroutine to be run and its value captured at the
        time that it is cloned. Named subroutines are not cloned like this, so
        the attribute does not make sense on them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Hexadecimal float: internal error
    <p class="Pp">(F) Something went horribly bad in hexadecimal float
      handling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Hexadecimal float: unsupported long double format
    <p class="Pp">(F) You have configured Perl to use long doubles but the
        internals of the long double format are unknown, therefore the
        hexadecimal float output is impossible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Illegal suidscript
    <p class="Pp">(F) The script run under suidperl was somehow illegal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In '(?...)', the '(' and '?' must be adjacent in regex; marked by
      &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/
    <p class="Pp">(F) The two-character sequence
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?&quot;</span> in this context in a regular
        expression pattern should be an indivisible token, with nothing
        intervening between the <span class="Li">&quot;(&quot;</span> and the
        <span class="Li">&quot;?&quot;</span>, but you separated them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In '(*VERB...)', the '(' and '*' must be adjacent in regex; marked by
      &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/
    <p class="Pp">(F) The two-character sequence
        <span class="Li">&quot;(*&quot;</span> in this context in a regular
        expression pattern should be an indivisible token, with nothing
        intervening between the <span class="Li">&quot;(&quot;</span> and the
        <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>, but you separated them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Invalid quantifier in {,} in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/
    <p class="Pp">(F) The pattern looks like a {min,max} quantifier, but the min
        or max could not be parsed as a valid number: either it has leading
        zeroes, or it represents too big a number to cope with. The
        &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE shows where in the regular expression the problem was
        discovered. See perlre.</p>
  </li>
  <li>'%s' is an unknown bound type in regex
    <p class="Pp">(F) You used <span class="Li">&quot;\b{...}&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;\B{...}&quot;</span> and the
        <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> is not known to Perl. The
        current valid ones are given in &quot;\b{}, \b, \B{}, \B&quot; in
        perlrebackslash.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Missing or undefined argument to require
    <p class="Pp">(F) You tried to call
        <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> with no argument or with an
        undefined value as an argument.
        <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> expects either a package
        name or a file-specification as an argument. See &quot;require&quot; in
        perlfunc.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Formerly, <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> with no
        argument or <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> warned about a
        Null filename.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp"><i>New Warnings</i></p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>\C is deprecated in regex
    <p class="Pp">(D deprecated) The <span class="Li">&quot;/\C/&quot;</span>
        character class was deprecated in v5.20, and now emits a warning. It is
        intended that it will become an error in v5.24. This character class
        matches a single byte even if it appears within a multi-byte character,
        breaks encapsulation, and can corrupt UTF-8 strings.</p>

        range, that is, all the characters in it are considered to be the
        Unicode characters, and which may be different code points on some
        platforms Perl runs on. For example,
        <span class="Li">&quot;[\N{U+06}-\x08]&quot;</span> is treated as if you

    <p class="Pp">Stricter rules help to find typos and other errors. Perhaps
        you didn't even intend a range here, if the

        character, or should have been escaped (like
        <span class="Li">&quot;\-&quot;</span>). If you did intend a range, the

    <p class="Pp">(You can force portability by specifying a Unicode range,
        which means that the endpoints are specified by
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span>, but the meaning may still
        not be obvious.) The stricter rules require that ranges that start or
        stop with an ASCII character that is not a control have all their
        endpoints be a literal character, and not some escape sequence (like
        <span class="Li">&quot;\x41&quot;</span>), and the ranges must be all

    <p class="Pp">Stricter rules help to find typos and other errors. You
        included a range, and at least one of the end points is a decimal digit.
        Under the stricter rules, when this happens, both end points should be

  </li>
  <li>Use of \b{} for non-UTF-8 locale is wrong. Assuming a UTF-8 locale
    <p class="Pp">(W locale) You are matching a regular expression using locale
        rules, and a Unicode boundary is being matched, but the locale is not a
        Unicode one. This doesn't make sense. Perl will continue, assuming a
        Unicode (UTF-8) locale, but the results could well be wrong except if
        the locale happens to be ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) where this message is
        spurious and can be ignored.</p>

  </li>
  <li>Using /u for '%s' instead of /%s in regex; marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/
    <p class="Pp">(W regexp) You used a Unicode boundary
        (<span class="Li">&quot;\b{...}&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;\B{...}&quot;</span>) in a portion of a regular
        expression where the character set modifiers
        <span class="Li">&quot;/a&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;/aa&quot;</span> are in effect. These two
        modifiers indicate an ASCII interpretation, and this doesn't make sense
        for a Unicode definition. The generated regular expression will compile
        so that the boundary uses all of Unicode. No other portion of the
        regular expression is affected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The bitwise feature is experimental
    <p class="Pp">(S experimental::bitwise) This warning is emitted if you use
        bitwise operators (<span class="Li">&quot;&amp; | ^ ~ &amp;. |. ^.
        ~.&quot;</span>) with the &quot;bitwise&quot; feature enabled. Simply
        suppress the warning if you want to use the feature, but know that in
        doing so you are taking the risk of using an experimental feature which
        may change or be removed in a future Perl version:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    no warnings &quot;experimental::bitwise&quot;;
    use feature &quot;bitwise&quot;;
    $x |.= $y;

  </li>
  <li>Unescaped left brace in regex is deprecated, passed through in regex;
      marked by &lt;-- HERE in m/%s/
    <p class="Pp">(D deprecated, regexp) You used a literal
        <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> character in a regular expression
        pattern. You should change to use <span class="Li">&quot;\{&quot;</span>
        instead, because a future version of Perl (tentatively v5.26) will
        consider this to be a syntax error. If the pattern delimiters are also
        braces, any matching right brace (<span class="Li">&quot;}&quot;</span>)
        should also be escaped to avoid confusing the parser, for example,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    qr{abc\{def\}ghi}
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Use of literal non-graphic characters in variable names is deprecated
    <p class="Pp">(D deprecated) Using literal non-graphic (including control)
        characters in the source to refer to the <i>^FOO</i> variables, like
        <span class="Li">$^X</span> and

  </li>
  <li>Useless use of attribute &quot;const&quot;
    <p class="Pp">(W misc) The <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span>
        attribute has no effect except on anonymous closure prototypes. You
        applied it to a subroutine via attributes.pm. This is only useful inside
        an attribute handler for an anonymous subroutine.</p>

  <li>Useless use of /d modifier in transliteration operator
    <p class="Pp">This is not a new diagnostic, but in earlier releases was
        accidentally not displayed if the transliteration contained wide

  </li>
  <li>&quot;use re 'strict'&quot; is experimental
    <p class="Pp">(S experimental::re_strict) The things that are different when
        a regular expression pattern is compiled under
        <span class="Li">'strict'</span> are subject to change in future Perl
        releases in incompatible ways; there are also proposals to change how to
        enable strict checking instead of using this subpragma. This means that
        a pattern that compiles today may not in a future Perl release. This
        warning is to alert you to that risk.</p>

  <li>Warning: unable to close filehandle properly: <span class="Li">%s</span>
    <p class="Pp">Warning: unable to close filehandle <span class="Li">%s</span>
        properly: <span class="Li">%s</span></p>
    <p class="Pp">(S io) Previously, perl silently ignored any errors when doing
        an implicit close of a filehandle, <i>i.e.</i> where the reference count
        of the filehandle reached zero and the user's code hadn't already called
        <span class="Li">&quot;close()&quot;</span>; <i>e.g.</i></p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    {
        open my $fh, '&gt;', $file  or die &quot;open: '$file': $!\n&quot;;
        print $fh, $data  or die;
    } # implicit close here
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In a situation such as disk full, due to buffering, the error
        may only be detected during the final close, so not checking the result
        of the close is dangerous.</p>
    <p class="Pp">So perl now warns in such situations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Wide character (U+%X) in <span class="Li">%s</span>
    <p class="Pp">(W locale) While in a single-byte locale (<i>i.e.</i>, a
        non-UTF-8 one), a multi-byte character was encountered. Perl considers
        this character to be the specified Unicode code point. Combining
        non-UTF-8 locales and Unicode is dangerous. Almost certainly some
        characters will have two different representations. For example, in the
        ISO 8859-7 (Greek) locale, the code point 0xC3 represents a Capital
        Gamma. But so also does 0x393. This will make string comparisons
        unreliable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You likely need to figure out how this multi-byte character
        got mixed up with your single-byte locale (or perhaps you thought you
        had a UTF-8 locale, but Perl disagrees).</p>

  <dd>Core perl now works on this EBCDIC platform. Earlier perls also worked,
      but, even though support wasn't officially withdrawn, recent perls would
      not compile and run well. Perl 5.20 would work, but had many bugs which
      have now been fixed. Many CPAN modules that ship with Perl still fail
      tests, including <span class="Li">&quot;Pod::Simple&quot;</span>. However
      the version of <span class="Li">&quot;Pod::Simple&quot;</span> currently
      on CPAN should work; it was fixed too late to include in Perl 5.22. Work
      is under way to fix many of the still-broken CPAN modules, which likely
      will be installed on CPAN when completed, so that you may not have to wait
      until Perl 5.24 to get a working version.</dd>

  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>Experimental support has been added to allow ops in the optree to locate
      their parent, if any. This is enabled by the non-default build option
      <span class="Li">&quot;-DPERL_OP_PARENT&quot;</span>. It is envisaged that
      this will eventually become enabled by default, so XS code which directly
      accesses the <span class="Li">&quot;op_sibling&quot;</span> field of ops
      should be updated to be future-proofed.
    <p class="Pp">On <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot;</span> builds,
        the <span class="Li">&quot;op_sibling&quot;</span> field has been
        renamed <span class="Li">&quot;op_sibparent&quot;</span> and a new flag,
        <span class="Li">&quot;op_moresib&quot;</span>, added. On the last op in
        a sibling chain, <span class="Li">&quot;op_moresib&quot;</span> is false
        and <span class="Li">&quot;op_sibparent&quot;</span> points to the
        parent (if any) rather than being
        <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To make existing code work transparently whether using
        <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot;</span> or not, a number of
        new macros and functions have been added that should be used, rather
        than directly manipulating
        <span class="Li">&quot;op_sibling&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For the case of just reading
        <span class="Li">&quot;op_sibling&quot;</span> to determine the next
        sibling, two new macros have been added. A simple scan through a sibling
        chain like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    for (; kid-&gt;op_sibling; kid = kid-&gt;op_sibling) { ... }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">should now be written as:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    for (; OpHAS_SIBLING(kid); kid = OpSIBLING(kid)) { ... }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For altering optrees, a general-purpose function
        <span class="Li">&quot;op_sibling_splice()&quot;</span> has been added,
        which allows for manipulation of a chain of sibling ops. By analogy with
        the Perl function <span class="Li">&quot;splice()&quot;</span>, it
        allows you to cut out zero or more ops from a sibling chain and replace
        them with zero or more new ops. It transparently handles all the
        updating of sibling, parent, op_last pointers etc.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you need to manipulate ops at a lower level, then three new
        macros, <span class="Li">&quot;OpMORESIB_set&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;OpLASTSIB_set&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;OpMAYBESIB_set&quot;</span> are intended to be a
        low-level portable way to set
        <span class="Li">&quot;op_sibling&quot;</span> /
        <span class="Li">&quot;op_sibparent&quot;</span> while also updating
        <span class="Li">&quot;op_moresib&quot;</span>. The first sets the
        sibling pointer to a new sibling, the second makes the op the last
        sibling, and the third conditionally does the first or second action.
        Note that unlike <span class="Li">&quot;op_sibling_splice()&quot;</span>
        these macros won't maintain consistency in the parent at the same time
        (<i>e.g.</i> by updating <span class="Li">&quot;op_first&quot;</span>
        and <span class="Li">&quot;op_last&quot;</span> where appropriate).</p>
    <p class="Pp">A C-level <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_op_parent()&quot;</span>
        function and a Perl-level
        <span class="Li">&quot;B::OP::parent()&quot;</span> method have been
        added. The C function only exists under
        <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot;</span> builds (using it is
        build-time error on vanilla perls).
        <span class="Li">&quot;B::OP::parent()&quot;</span> exists always, but
        on a vanilla build it always returns
        <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span>. Under
        <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot;</span>, they return the
        parent of the current op, if any. The variable
        <span class="Li">$B::OP::does_parent</span> allows you to determine
        whether <span class="Li">&quot;B&quot;</span> supports retrieving an
        op's parent.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;PERL_OP_PARENT&quot;</span> was
        introduced in 5.21.2, but the interface was changed considerably in
        5.21.11. If you updated your code before the 5.21.11 changes, it may
        require further revision. The main changes after 5.21.2 were:</p>

  <li>Accessing &quot;CvPADLIST&quot; in perlapi on an XSUB is now forbidden.
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;CvPADLIST&quot;</span> field has
        been reused for a different internal purpose for XSUBs. So in
        particular, you can no longer rely on it being NULL as a test of whether
        a CV is an XSUB. Use <span class="Li">&quot;CvISXSUB()&quot;</span>
        instead.</p>
  </li>
  <li>SVs of type <span class="Li">&quot;SVt_NV&quot;</span> are now sometimes

      when <span class="Li">&quot;sizeof(NV) &lt;=</span>
      <span class="Li">sizeof(IV)&quot;</span>. &quot;Bodiless&quot; means that
      the NV value is stored directly in the head of an SV, without requiring a
      separate body to be allocated. This trick has already been used for IVs
      since 5.9.2 (though in the case of IVs, it is always used, regardless of
      platform and build configuration).</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">$DB::single</span>,
      <span class="Li">$DB::signal</span> and <span class="Li">$DB::trace</span>
      variables now have set- and get-magic that stores their values as IVs, and
      those IVs are used when testing their values in
      <span class="Li">&quot;pp_dbstate()&quot;</span>. This prevents perl from
      recursing infinitely if an overloaded object is assigned to any of those
      variables. [perl #122445]

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;Perl_tmps_grow()&quot;</span>, which is marked as

      no longer used in the core since commit 6f1401dc2a five years ago, and
      have not been found present on CPAN.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;SvFAKE&quot;</span> bit (unused on HVs) got
      informally reserved by David Mitchell for future work on vtables.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;sv_catpvn_flags()&quot;</span> function accepts
      <span class="Li">&quot;SV_CATBYTES&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;SV_CATUTF8&quot;</span> flags, which specify
      whether the appended string is bytes or UTF-8, respectively. (These flags
      have in fact been present since 5.16.0, but were formerly not regarded as
      part of the API.)</li>
  <li>A new opcode class, <span class="Li">&quot;METHOP&quot;</span>, has been
      introduced. It holds information used at runtime to improve the
      performance of class/object method calls.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;OP_METHOD&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;OP_METHOD_NAMED&quot;</span> have changed from
        being <span class="Li">&quot;UNOP/SVOP&quot;</span> to being
        <span class="Li">&quot;METHOP&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;cv_name()&quot;</span> is a new API function that
      can be passed a CV or GV. It returns an SV containing the name of the
      subroutine, for use in diagnostics.
    <p class="Pp">[perl #116735]
        &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116735&gt; [perl #120441]
        &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120441&gt;</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;cv_set_call_checker_flags()&quot;</span> is a new
      API function that works like
      <span class="Li">&quot;cv_set_call_checker()&quot;</span>, except that it
      allows the caller to specify whether the call checker requires a full GV
      for reporting the subroutine's name, or whether it could be passed a CV
      instead. Whatever value is passed will be acceptable to
      <span class="Li">&quot;cv_name()&quot;</span>.
      <span class="Li">&quot;cv_set_call_checker()&quot;</span> guarantees there
      will be a GV, but it may have to create one on the fly, which is
      inefficient. [perl #116735]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116735&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;CvGV&quot;</span> (which is not part of the API) is
      now a more complex macro, which may call a function and reify a GV. For
      those cases where it has been used as a boolean,
      <span class="Li">&quot;CvHASGV&quot;</span> has been added, which will
      return true for CVs that notionally have GVs, but without reifying the GV.
      <span class="Li">&quot;CvGV&quot;</span> also returns a GV now for lexical
      subs. [perl #120441]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120441&gt;</li>
  <li>The &quot;sync_locale&quot; in perlapi function has been added to the
      public API. Changing the program's locale should be avoided by XS code.
      Nevertheless, certain non-Perl libraries called from XS need to do so,
      such as <span class="Li">&quot;Gtk&quot;</span>. When this happens, Perl
      needs to be told that the locale has changed. Use this function to do so,
      before returning to Perl.</li>
  <li>The defines and labels for the flags in the
      <span class="Li">&quot;op_private&quot;</span> field of OPs are now
      auto-generated from data in <i>regen/op_private</i>. The noticeable effect
      of this is that some of the flag output of
      <span class="Li">&quot;Concise&quot;</span> might differ slightly, and the
      flag output of <span class="Li">&quot;perl&#x00A0;-Dx&quot;</span> may
      differ considerably (they both use the same set of labels now). Also,
      debugging builds now have a new assertion in
      <span class="Li">&quot;op_free()&quot;</span> to ensure that the op
      doesn't have any unrecognized flags set in
      <span class="Li">&quot;op_private&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>The deprecated variable <span class="Li">&quot;PL_sv_objcount&quot;</span>
      has been removed.</li>
  <li>Perl now tries to keep the locale category
      <span class="Li">&quot;LC_NUMERIC&quot;</span> set to &quot;C&quot; except
      around operations that need it to be set to the program's underlying
      locale. This protects the many XS modules that cannot cope with the
      decimal radix character not being a dot. Prior to this release, Perl
      initialized this category to &quot;C&quot;, but a call to
      <span class="Li">&quot;POSIX::setlocale()&quot;</span> would change it.
      Now such a call will change the underlying locale of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;LC_NUMERIC&quot;</span> category for the program,
      but the locale exposed to XS code will remain &quot;C&quot;. There are new
      macros to manipulate the LC_NUMERIC locale, including
      <span class="Li">&quot;STORE_LC_NUMERIC_SET_TO_NEEDED&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;STORE_LC_NUMERIC_FORCE_TO_UNDERLYING&quot;</span>.
      See &quot;Locale-related functions and macros&quot; in perlapi.</li>
  <li>A new macro <span class="Li">&quot;isUTF8_CHAR&quot;</span> has been
      written which efficiently determines if the string given by its parameters
      begins with a well-formed UTF-8 encoded character.</li>
  <li>The following private API functions had their context parameter removed:
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_cast_ulong&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_cast_i32&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_cast_iv&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_cast_uv&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_cv_const_sv&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_mg_find&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_mg_findext&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_mg_magical&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_mini_mktime&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_my_dirfd&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_sv_backoff&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_utf8_hop&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Note that the prefix-less versions of those functions that are
        part of the public API, such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;cast_i32()&quot;</span>, remain unaffected.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;PADNAME&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;PADNAMELIST&quot;</span> types are now separate
      types, and no longer simply aliases for SV and AV. [perl #123223]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123223&gt;.</li>
  <li>Pad names are now always UTF-8. The
      <span class="Li">&quot;PadnameUTF8&quot;</span> macro always returns true.
      Previously, this was effectively the case already, but any support for two
      different internal representations of pad names has now been removed.</li>
  <li>A new op class, <span class="Li">&quot;UNOP_AUX&quot;</span>, has been
      added. This is a subclass of <span class="Li">&quot;UNOP&quot;</span> with
      an <span class="Li">&quot;op_aux&quot;</span> field added, which points to
      an array of unions of UV, SV* etc. It is intended for where an op needs to
      store more data than a simple <span class="Li">&quot;op_sv&quot;</span> or
      whatever. Currently the only op of this type is
      <span class="Li">&quot;OP_MULTIDEREF&quot;</span> (see next item).</li>
  <li>A new op has been added,
      <span class="Li">&quot;OP_MULTIDEREF&quot;</span>, which performs one or
      more nested array and hash lookups where the key is a constant or simple
      variable. For example the expression
      <span class="Li">$a[0]{$k}[$i]</span>, which previously involved ten
      <span class="Li">&quot;rv2Xv&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;Xelem&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;gvsv&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span> ops is now performed by a single
      <span class="Li">&quot;multideref&quot;</span> op. It can also handle
      <span class="Li">&quot;local&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;exists&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;delete&quot;</span>. A non-simple index expression,
      such as <span class="Li">&quot;[$i+1]&quot;</span> is still done using
      <span class="Li">&quot;aelem&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;helem&quot;</span>,
      and single-level array lookup with a small constant index is still done
      using <span class="Li">&quot;aelemfast&quot;</span>.</li>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span> now sets
      <span class="Li">$!</span>
    <p class="Pp">When an I/O error occurs, the fact that there has been an
        error is recorded in the handle.
        <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span> returns false for such a
        handle. Previously, the value of <span class="Li">$!</span> would be
        untouched by <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span>, so the common
        convention of writing
        <span class="Li">&quot;close&#x00A0;$fh&#x00A0;or&#x00A0;die&#x00A0;$!&quot;</span>
        did not work reliably. Now the handle records the value of
        <span class="Li">$!</span>, too, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span> restores it.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;no re&quot;</span> now can turn off everything that
      <span class="Li">&quot;use re&quot;</span> enables
    <p class="Pp">Previously, running <span class="Li">&quot;no re&quot;</span>
        would turn off only a few things. Now it can turn off all the enabled
        things. For example, the only way to stop debugging, once enabled, was
        to exit the enclosing block; that is now fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;pack(&quot;D&quot;, $x)&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;pack(&quot;F&quot;, $x)&quot;</span> now zero the
      padding on x86 long double builds. Under some build options on GCC 4.8 and
      later, they used to either overwrite the zero-initialized padding, or
      bypass the initialized buffer entirely. This caused <i>op/pack.t</i> to
      fail. [perl #123971]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123971&gt;</li>
  <li>Extending an array cloned from a parent thread could result in
      &quot;Modification of a read-only value attempted&quot; errors when
      attempting to modify the new elements. [perl #124127]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124127&gt;</li>
  <li>An assertion failure and subsequent crash with
      <span class="Li">&quot;*x=&lt;y&gt;&quot;</span> has been fixed. [perl
      #123790] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123790&gt;</li>
  <li>A possible crashing/looping bug related to compiling lexical subs has been
      fixed. [perl #124099]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124099&gt;</li>
  <li>UTF-8 now works correctly in function names, in unquoted HERE-document
      terminators, and in variable names used as array indexes. [perl #124113]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124113&gt;</li>
  <li>Repeated global pattern matches in scalar context on large tainted strings
      were exponentially slow depending on the current match position in the
      string. [perl #123202]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123202&gt;</li>
  <li>Various crashes due to the parser getting confused by syntax errors have

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> in the scope of lexical

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;my $x : attr&quot;</span> syntax inside various
      list operators no longer fails assertions. [perl #123817]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123817&gt;</li>
  <li>An <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> sign in quotes followed by a
      non-ASCII digit (which is not a valid identifier) would cause the parser
      to crash, instead of simply trying the
      <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> as literal. This has been fixed.
      [perl #123963]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123963&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;*bar::=*foo::=*glob_with_hash&quot;</span> has been
      crashing since Perl 5.14, but no longer does. [perl #123847]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123847&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> in scalar context was not
      pushing an item on to the stack, resulting in bugs.
      (<span class="Li">&quot;print&#x00A0;4,&#x00A0;scalar&#x00A0;do&#x00A0;{&#x00A0;foreach(@x){}&#x00A0;}&#x00A0;+&#x00A0;1&quot;</span>
      would print 5.) It has been fixed to return
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>. [perl #124004]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124004&gt;</li>
  <li>Several cases of data used to store environment variable contents in core
      C code being potentially overwritten before being used have been fixed.
      [perl #123748]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123748&gt;</li>
  <li>Some patterns starting with <span class="Li">&quot;/.*..../&quot;</span>
      matched against long strings have been slow since v5.8, and some of the
      form <span class="Li">&quot;/.*..../i&quot;</span> have been slow since
      v5.18. They are now all fast again. [perl #123743]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123743&gt;.</li>
  <li>The original visible value of <span class="Li">$/</span> is now preserved
      when it is set to an invalid value. Previously if you set
      <span class="Li">$/</span> to a reference to an array, for example, perl
      would produce a runtime error and not set
      <span class="Li">&quot;PL_rs&quot;</span>, but Perl code that checked
      <span class="Li">$/</span> would see the array reference. [perl #123218]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123218&gt;.</li>
  <li>In a regular expression pattern, a POSIX class, like
      <span class="Li">&quot;[:ascii:]&quot;</span>, must be inside a bracketed
      character class, like <span class="Li">&quot;qr/[[:ascii:]]/&quot;</span>.
      A warning is issued when something looking like a POSIX class is not
      inside a bracketed class. That warning wasn't getting generated when the
      POSIX class was negated: <span class="Li">&quot;[:^ascii:]&quot;</span>.
      This is now fixed.</li>
  <li>Perl 5.14.0 introduced a bug whereby
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval&#x00A0;{&#x00A0;LABEL:&#x00A0;}&quot;</span>
      would crash. This has been fixed. [perl #123652]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123652&gt;.</li>
  <li>Various crashes due to the parser getting confused by syntax errors have
      been fixed. [perl #123617]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123617&gt;. [perl #123737]

      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123753&gt;. [perl #123677]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123677&gt;.</li>
  <li>Code like <span class="Li">&quot;/$a[/&quot;</span> used to read the next
      line of input and treat it as though it came immediately after the opening
      bracket. Some invalid code consequently would parse and run, but some code
      caused crashes, so this is now disallowed. [perl #123712]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123712&gt;.</li>
  <li>Fix argument underflow for <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span>. [perl
      #123874] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123874&gt;.</li>
  <li>Fix handling of non-strict <span class="Li">&quot;\x{}&quot;</span>. Now
      <span class="Li">&quot;\x{}&quot;</span> is equivalent to
      <span class="Li">&quot;\x{0}&quot;</span> instead of faulting.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;stat -t&quot;</span> is now no longer treated as
      stackable, just like <span class="Li">&quot;-t stat&quot;</span>. [perl
      #123816] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123816&gt;.</li>
  <li>The following no longer causes a SEGV:
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr{x+(y(?0))*}&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Fixed infinite loop in parsing backrefs in regexp patterns.</li>
  <li>Several minor bug fixes in behavior of Infinity and NaN, including
      warnings when stringifying Infinity-like or NaN-like strings. For example,
      &quot;NaNcy&quot; doesn't numify to NaN anymore.</li>
  <li>A bug in regular expression patterns that could lead to segfaults and
      other crashes has been fixed. This occurred only in patterns compiled with
      <span class="Li">&quot;/i&quot;</span> while taking into account the
      current POSIX locale (which usually means they have to be compiled within
      the scope of <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span>), and
      there must be a string of at least 128 consecutive bytes to match. [perl
      #123539] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123539&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;s///g&quot;</span> now works on very long strings
      (where there are more than 2 billion iterations) instead of dying with
      'Substitution loop'. [perl #103260]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=103260&gt;. [perl #123071]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123071&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;gmtime&quot;</span> no longer crashes with
      not-a-number values. [perl #123495]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123495&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;\()&quot;</span> (a reference to an empty list),
      and <span class="Li">&quot;y///&quot;</span> with lexical
      <span class="Li">$_</span> in scope, could both do a bad write past the
      end of the stack. They have both been fixed to extend the stack
    first.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;prototype()&quot;</span> with no arguments used to
      read the previous item on the stack, so
      <span class="Li">&quot;print&#x00A0;&quot;foo&quot;,&#x00A0;prototype()&quot;</span>
      would print foo's prototype. It has been fixed to infer
      <span class="Li">$_</span> instead. [perl #123514]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123514&gt;.</li>
  <li>Some cases of lexical state subs declared inside predeclared subs could
      crash, for example when evalling a string including the name of an outer
      variable, but no longer do.</li>
  <li>Some cases of nested lexical state subs inside anonymous subs could cause
      'Bizarre copy' errors or possibly even crashes.</li>
  <li>When trying to emit warnings, perl's default debugger (<i>perl5db.pl</i>)
      was sometimes giving 'Undefined subroutine &amp;DB::db_warn called'
      instead. This bug, which started to occur in Perl 5.18, has been fixed.
      [perl #123553]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123553&gt;.</li>
  <li>Certain syntax errors in substitutions, such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;s/${&lt;&gt;{})//&quot;</span>, would crash, and
      had done so since Perl 5.10. (In some cases the crash did not start
      happening till 5.16.) The crash has, of course, been fixed. [perl #123542]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123542&gt;.</li>
  <li>Fix a couple of string grow size calculation overflows; in particular, a
      repeat expression like
      <span class="Li">&quot;33&#x00A0;x&#x00A0;~3&quot;</span> could cause a
      large buffer overflow since the new output buffer size was not correctly
      handled by <span class="Li">&quot;SvGROW()&quot;</span>. An expression
      like this now properly produces a memory wrap panic. [perl #123554]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123554&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;formline(&quot;@...&quot;,
      &quot;a&quot;);&quot;</span> would crash. The
      <span class="Li">&quot;FF_CHECKNL&quot;</span> case in
      <span class="Li">&quot;pp_formline()&quot;</span> didn't set the pointer
      used to mark the chop position, which led to the
      <span class="Li">&quot;FF_MORE&quot;</span> case crashing with a
      segmentation fault. This has been fixed. [perl #123538]

  <li>A possible buffer overrun and crash when parsing a literal pattern during
      regular expression compilation has been fixed. [perl #123604]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123604&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;fchmod()&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;futimes()&quot;</span> now set
      <span class="Li">$!</span> when they fail due to being passed a closed
      file handle. [perl #122703]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122703&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;op_free()&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;scalarvoid()&quot;</span> no longer crash due to a
      stack overflow when freeing a deeply recursive op tree. [perl #108276]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=108276&gt;.</li>
  <li>In Perl 5.20.0, <span class="Li">$^N</span> accidentally had the internal
      UTF-8 flag turned off if accessed from a code block within a regular
      expression, effectively UTF-8-encoding the value. This has been fixed.
      [perl #123135]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123135&gt;.</li>
  <li>A failed <span class="Li">&quot;semctl&quot;</span> call no longer
      overwrites existing items on the stack, which means that
      <span class="Li">&quot;(semctl(-1,0,0,0))[0]&quot;</span> no longer gives
      an &quot;uninitialized&quot; warning.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;else{foo()}&quot;</span> with no space before
      <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span> is now better at assigning the
      right line number to that statement. [perl #122695]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122695&gt;.</li>
  <li>Sometimes the assignment in <span class="Li">&quot;@array =
      split&quot;</span> gets optimised so that
      <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> itself writes directly to the
      array. This caused a bug, preventing this assignment from being used in
      lvalue context. So
      <span class="Li">&quot;(@a=split//,&quot;foo&quot;)=bar()&quot;</span> was
      an error. (This bug probably goes back to Perl 3, when the optimisation
      was added.) It has now been fixed. [perl #123057]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123057&gt;.</li>
  <li>When an argument list fails the checks specified by a subroutine signature
      (which is still an experimental feature), the resulting error messages now
      give the file and line number of the caller, not of the called subroutine.
      [perl #121374]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121374&gt;.</li>
  <li>The flip-flop operators (<span class="Li">&quot;..&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> in scalar context) used to
      maintain a separate state for each recursion level (the number of times
      the enclosing sub was called recursively), contrary to the documentation.
      Now each closure has one internal state for each flip-flop. [perl #122829]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122829&gt;.</li>
  <li>The flip-flop operator (<span class="Li">&quot;..&quot;</span> in scalar
      context) would return the same scalar each time, unless the containing
      subroutine was called recursively. Now it always returns a new scalar.
      [perl #122829]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122829&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;no&quot;</span>, statement labels, special blocks
      (<span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span>) and pod are now permitted as
      the first thing in a <span class="Li">&quot;map&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;grep&quot;</span> block, the block after
      <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;say&quot;</span> (or other functions) returning a
      handle, and within <span class="Li">&quot;${...}&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;@{...}&quot;</span>, etc. [perl #122782]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122782&gt;.</li>
  <li>The repetition operator <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span> now
      propagates lvalue context to its left-hand argument when used in contexts
      like <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span>. That allows
      <span class="Li">&quot;for(($#that_array)x2)&#x00A0;{&#x00A0;...&#x00A0;}&quot;</span>
      to work as expected if the loop modifies <span class="Li">$_</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;(...) x ...&quot;</span> in scalar context used to
      corrupt the stack if one operand was an object with &quot;x&quot;
      overloading, causing erratic behavior. [perl #121827]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121827&gt;.</li>
  <li>Assignment to a lexical scalar is often optimised away; for example in
      <span class="Li">&quot;my $x; $x = $y + $z&quot;</span>, the assign
      operator is optimised away and the add operator writes its result directly
      to <span class="Li">$x</span>. Various bugs related to this optimisation
      have been fixed. Certain operators on the right-hand side would sometimes
      fail to assign the value at all or assign the wrong value, or would call
      STORE twice or not at all on tied variables. The operators affected were
      <span class="Li">&quot;$foo++&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;$foo--&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;-$foo&quot;</span> under
      <span class="Li">&quot;use</span> <span class="Li">integer&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;chomp&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;chr&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;setpgrp&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>List assignments were sometimes buggy if the same scalar ended up on both
      sides of the assignment due to use of
      <span class="Li">&quot;tied&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;values&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span>. The result would be the wrong
      value getting assigned.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;setpgrp($nonzero)&quot;</span> (with one argument)
      was accidentally changed in 5.16 to mean
      <span class="Li">setpgrp(0)</span>. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;__SUB__&quot;</span> could return the wrong value
      or even corrupt memory under the debugger (the
      <span class="Li">&quot;-d&quot;</span> switch) and in subs containing
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval $string&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>When
      <span class="Li">&quot;sub&#x00A0;()&#x00A0;{&#x00A0;$var&#x00A0;}&quot;</span>
      becomes inlinable, it now returns a different scalar each time, just as a
      non-inlinable sub would, though Perl still optimises the copy away in
      cases where it would make no observable difference.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;my&#x00A0;sub&#x00A0;f&#x00A0;()&#x00A0;{&#x00A0;$var&#x00A0;}&quot;</span>
      and
      <span class="Li">&quot;sub&#x00A0;()&#x00A0;:&#x00A0;attr&#x00A0;{&#x00A0;$var&#x00A0;}&quot;</span>
      are no longer eligible for inlining. The former would crash; the latter
      would just throw the attributes away. An exception is made for the
      little-known <span class="Li">&quot;:method&quot;</span> attribute, which
      does nothing much.</li>
  <li>Inlining of subs with an empty prototype is now more consistent than
      before. Previously, a sub with multiple statements, of which all but the
      last were optimised away, would be inlinable only if it were an anonymous
      sub containing a string <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span> declaration or closing over an
      outer lexical variable (or any anonymous sub under the debugger). Now any
      sub that gets folded to a single constant after statements have been
      optimised away is eligible for inlining. This applies to things like
      <span class="Li">&quot;sub</span> <span class="Li">() { jabber() if DEBUG;
      42 }&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Some subroutines with an explicit
        <span class="Li">&quot;return&quot;</span> were being made inlinable,
        contrary to the documentation, Now
        <span class="Li">&quot;return&quot;</span> always prevents inlining.</p>
  </li>
  <li>On some systems, such as VMS, <span class="Li">&quot;crypt&quot;</span>
      can return a non-ASCII string. If a scalar assigned to had contained a
      UTF-8 string previously, then <span class="Li">&quot;crypt&quot;</span>
      would not turn off the UTF-8 flag, thus corrupting the return value. This
      would happen with
      <span class="Li">&quot;$lexical&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;crypt&#x00A0;...&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;crypt&quot;</span> no longer calls
      <span class="Li">&quot;FETCH&quot;</span> twice on a tied first
    argument.</li>
  <li>An unterminated here-doc on the last line of a quote-like operator
      (<span class="Li">&quot;qq[${ &lt;&lt;END }]&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;/(?{ &lt;&lt;END })/&quot;</span>) no longer causes
      a double free. It started doing so in 5.18.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;index()&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;rindex()&quot;</span> no longer crash when used on
      strings over 2GB in size. [perl #121562]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121562&gt;.</li>
  <li>A small, previously intentional, memory leak in
      <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_SYS_INIT&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;PERL_SYS_INIT3&quot;</span>
      on Win32 builds was fixed. This might affect embedders who repeatedly
      create and destroy perl engines within the same process.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;POSIX::localeconv()&quot;</span> now returns the
      data for the program's underlying locale even when called from outside the
      scope of <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;POSIX::localeconv()&quot;</span> now works properly
      on platforms which don't have
      <span class="Li">&quot;LC_NUMERIC&quot;</span> and/or
      <span class="Li">&quot;LC_MONETARY&quot;</span>, or for which Perl has
      been compiled to disregard either or both of these locale categories. In
      such circumstances, there are now no entries for the corresponding values
      in the hash returned by
    <span class="Li">&quot;localeconv()&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;POSIX::localeconv()&quot;</span> now marks
      appropriately the values it returns as UTF-8 or not. Previously they were
      always returned as bytes, even if they were supposed to be encoded as
      UTF-8.</li>
  <li>On Microsoft Windows, within the scope of
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span>, the following POSIX
      character classes gave results for many locales that did not conform to
      the POSIX standard: <span class="Li">&quot;[[:alnum:]]&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;[[:alpha:]]&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;[[:blank:]]&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;[[:digit:]]&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;[[:graph:]]&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;[[:lower:]]&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;[[:print:]]&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;[[:punct:]]&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;[[:upper:]]&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;[[:word:]]&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;[[:xdigit:]]&quot;</span>. This was because the
      underlying Microsoft implementation does not follow the standard. Perl now
      takes special precautions to correct for this.</li>
  <li>Many issues have been detected by Coverity
      &lt;http://www.coverity.com/&gt; and fixed.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;system()&quot;</span> and friends should now work
      properly on more Android builds.
    <p class="Pp">Due to an oversight, the value specified through
        <span class="Li">&quot;-Dtargetsh&quot;</span> to <i>Configure</i> would
        end up being ignored by some of the build process. This caused perls
        cross-compiled for Android to end up with defective versions of
        <span class="Li">&quot;system()&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;exec()&quot;</span> and backticks: the commands
        would end up looking for <span class="Li">&quot;/bin/sh&quot;</span>
        instead of <span class="Li">&quot;/system/bin/sh&quot;</span>, and so
        would fail for the vast majority of devices, leaving
        <span class="Li">$!</span> as
        <span class="Li">&quot;ENOENT&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;qr(...\(...\)...)&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr[...\[...\]...]&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr{...\{...\}...}&quot;</span> now work. Previously
      it was impossible to escape these three left-characters with a backslash
      within a regular expression pattern where otherwise they would be
      considered metacharacters, and the pattern opening delimiter was the
      character, and the closing delimiter was its mirror character.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;s///e&quot;</span> on tainted UTF-8 strings
      corrupted <span class="Li">&quot;pos()&quot;</span>. This bug, introduced
      in 5.20, is now fixed. [perl #122148]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122148&gt;.</li>
  <li>A non-word boundary in a regular expression
      (<span class="Li">&quot;\B&quot;</span>) did not always match the end of
      the string; in particular <span class="Li">&quot;q{} =~ /\B/&quot;</span>
      did not match. This bug, introduced in perl 5.14, is now fixed. [perl
      #122090] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122090&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;&quot; P&quot; =~ /(?=.*P)P/&quot;</span> should
      match, but did not. This is now fixed. [perl #122171]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122171&gt;.</li>
  <li>Failing to compile <span class="Li">&quot;use Foo&quot;</span> in an
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> could leave a spurious
      <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span> subroutine definition, which
      would produce a &quot;Subroutine BEGIN redefined&quot; warning on the next
      use of <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>, or other
      <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span> block. [perl #122107]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122107&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;method { BLOCK } ARGS&quot;</span> syntax now
      correctly parses the arguments if they begin with an opening brace. [perl
      #46947] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46947&gt;.</li>
  <li>External libraries and Perl may have different ideas of what the locale
      is. This is problematic when parsing version strings if the locale's
      numeric separator has been changed. Version parsing has been patched to
      ensure it handles the locales correctly. [perl #121930]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121930&gt;.</li>
  <li>A bug has been fixed where zero-length assertions and code blocks inside
      of a regex could cause <span class="Li">&quot;pos&quot;</span> to see an
      incorrect value. [perl #122460]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122460&gt;.</li>
  <li>Dereferencing of constants now works correctly for typeglob constants.
      Previously the glob was stringified and its name looked up. Now the glob
      itself is used. [perl #69456]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69456&gt;</li>
  <li>When parsing a sigil (<span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span>
      <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span>
      <span class="Li">&quot;%&quot;</span>
      <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;)&quot;</span> followed by braces, the parser
      no longer tries to guess whether it is a block or a hash constructor
      (causing a syntax error when it guesses the latter), since it can only be
      a block.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;undef&#x00A0;$reference&quot;</span> now frees the
      referent immediately, instead of hanging on to it until the next
      statement. [perl #122556]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122556&gt;</li>
  <li>Various cases where the name of a sub is used (autoload, overloading,
      error messages) used to crash for lexical subs, but have been fixed.</li>
  <li>Bareword lookup now tries to avoid vivifying packages if it turns out the
      bareword is not going to be a subroutine name.</li>
  <li>Compilation of anonymous constants (<i>e.g.</i>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;sub () { 3 }&quot;</span>) no longer deletes any
      subroutine named <span class="Li">&quot;__ANON__&quot;</span> in the
      current package. Not only was
      <span class="Li">&quot;*__ANON__{CODE}&quot;</span> cleared, but there was
      a memory leak, too. This bug goes back to Perl 5.8.0.</li>
  <li>Stub declarations like <span class="Li">&quot;sub f;&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;sub f ();&quot;</span> no longer wipe out constants
      of the same name declared by <span class="Li">&quot;use
      constant&quot;</span>. This bug was introduced in Perl 5.10.0.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;qr/[\N{named sequence}]/&quot;</span> now works
      properly in many instances.
    <p class="Pp">Some names known to
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span> refer to a sequence of
        multiple characters, instead of the usual single character. Bracketed
        character classes generally only match single characters, but now
        special handling has been added so that they can match named sequences,
        but not if the class is inverted or the sequence is specified as the
        beginning or end of a range. In these cases, the only behavior change
        from before is a slight rewording of the fatal error message given when
        this class is part of a <span class="Li">&quot;?[...])&quot;</span>
        construct. When the <span class="Li">&quot;[...]&quot;</span> stands
        alone, the same non-fatal warning as before is raised, and only the
        first character in the sequence is used, again just as before.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Tainted constants evaluated at compile time no longer cause unrelated
      statements to become tainted. [perl #122669]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122669&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;open&#x00A0;$$fh,&#x00A0;...&quot;</span>, which
      vivifies a handle with a name like
      <span class="Li">&quot;main::_GEN_0&quot;</span>, was not giving the
      handle the right reference count, so a double free could happen.</li>
  <li>When deciding that a bareword was a method name, the parser would get
      confused if an <span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span> sub with the same
      name existed, and look up the method in the package of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span> sub, instead of the package of the
      invocant.</li>
  <li>The parser no longer gets confused by
      <span class="Li">&quot;\U=&quot;</span> within a double-quoted string. It
      used to produce a syntax error, but now compiles it correctly. [perl
      #80368] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=80368&gt;</li>
  <li>It has always been the intention for the
      <span class="Li">&quot;-B&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;-T&quot;</span> file test operators to treat UTF-8
      encoded files as text. (perlfunc has been updated to say this.)
      Previously, it was possible for some files to be considered UTF-8 that
      actually weren't valid UTF-8. This is now fixed. The operators now work on
      EBCDIC platforms as well.</li>
  <li>Under some conditions warning messages raised during regular expression
      pattern compilation were being output more than once. This has now been
      fixed.</li>
  <li>Perl 5.20.0 introduced a regression in which a UTF-8 encoded regular
      expression pattern that contains a single ASCII lowercase letter did not
      match its uppercase counterpart. That has been fixed in both 5.20.1 and
      5.22.0. [perl #122655]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122655&gt;</li>
  <li>Constant folding could incorrectly suppress warnings if lexical warnings
      (<span class="Li">&quot;use warnings&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;no warnings&quot;</span>) were not in effect and
      <span class="Li">$^W</span> were false at compile time and true at run
      time.</li>
  <li>Loading Unicode tables during a regular expression match could cause
      assertion failures under debugging builds if the previous match used the
      very same regular expression. [perl #122747]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122747&gt;</li>
  <li>Thread cloning used to work incorrectly for lexical subs, possibly causing
      crashes or double frees on exit.</li>
  <li>Since Perl 5.14.0, deleting
      <span class="Li">$SomePackage::{__ANON__}</span> and then undefining an
      anonymous subroutine could corrupt things internally, resulting in
      Devel::Peek crashing or B.pm giving nonsensical data. This has been
    fixed.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;(caller&#x00A0;$n)[3]&quot;</span> now reports
      names of lexical subs, instead of treating them as
      <span class="Li">&quot;(unknown)&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;sort subname LIST&quot;</span> now supports using a
      lexical sub as the comparison routine.</li>
  <li>Aliasing (<i>e.g.</i>, via
      <span class="Li">&quot;*x&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;*y&quot;</span>) could confuse
      list assignments that mention the two names for the same variable on
      either side, causing wrong values to be assigned. [perl #15667]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=15667&gt;</li>
  <li>Long here-doc terminators could cause a bad read on short lines of input.
      This has been fixed. It is doubtful that any crash could have occurred.
      This bug goes back to when here-docs were introduced in Perl 3.000
      twenty-five years ago.</li>
  <li>An optimization in <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> to treat
      <span class="Li">&quot;split&#x00A0;/^/&quot;</span> like
      <span class="Li">&quot;split&#x00A0;/^/m&quot;</span> had the unfortunate
      side-effect of also treating
      <span class="Li">&quot;split&#x00A0;/\A/&quot;</span> like
      <span class="Li">&quot;split&#x00A0;/^/m&quot;</span>, which it should
      not. This has been fixed. (Note, however, that
      <span class="Li">&quot;split&#x00A0;/^x/&quot;</span> does not behave like
      <span class="Li">&quot;split&#x00A0;/^x/m&quot;</span>, which is also
      considered to be a bug and will be fixed in a future version.) [perl
      #122761] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122761&gt;</li>
  <li>The little-known
      <span class="Li">&quot;my&#x00A0;Class&#x00A0;$var&quot;</span> syntax
      (see fields and attributes) could get confused in the scope of
      <span class="Li">&quot;use utf8&quot;</span> if
      <span class="Li">&quot;Class&quot;</span> were a constant whose value
      contained Latin-1 characters.</li>
  <li>Locking and unlocking values via Hash::Util or
      <span class="Li">&quot;Internals::SvREADONLY&quot;</span> no longer has
      any effect on values that were read-only to begin with. Previously,
      unlocking such values could result in crashes, hangs or other erratic
      behavior.</li>
  <li>Some unterminated <span class="Li">&quot;(?(...)...)&quot;</span>
      constructs in regular expressions would either crash or give erroneous
      error messages. <span class="Li">&quot;/(?(1)/&quot;</span> is one such
      example.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;pack&#x00A0;&quot;w&quot;,&#x00A0;$tied&quot;</span>
      no longer calls FETCH twice.</li>
  <li>List assignments like
      <span class="Li">&quot;($x,&#x00A0;$z)&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;(1,&#x00A0;$y)&quot;</span>
      now work correctly if <span class="Li">$x</span> and
      <span class="Li">$y</span> have been aliased by
      <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Some patterns including code blocks with syntax errors, such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;/&#x00A0;(?{(^{})/&quot;</span>, would hang or fail
      assertions on debugging builds. Now they produce errors.</li>
  <li>An assertion failure when parsing <span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span>
      with debugging enabled has been fixed. [perl #122771]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122771&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;*a&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;*b;&#x00A0;@a&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;split&#x00A0;//,&#x00A0;$b[1]&quot;</span>
      could do a bad read and produce junk results.</li>
  <li>In
      <span class="Li">&quot;()&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;@array&#x00A0;=&#x00A0;split&quot;</span>,
      the <span class="Li">&quot;()&#x00A0;=&quot;</span> at the beginning no
      longer confuses the optimizer into assuming a limit of 1.</li>
  <li>Fatal warnings no longer prevent the output of syntax errors. [perl
      #122966] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122966&gt;.</li>
  <li>Fixed a NaN double-to-long-double conversion error on VMS. For quiet NaNs
      (and only on Itanium, not Alpha) negative infinity instead of NaN was
      produced.</li>
  <li>Fixed the issue that caused <span class="Li">&quot;make
      distclean&quot;</span> to incorrectly leave some files behind. [perl
      #122820] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122820&gt;.</li>
  <li>AIX now sets the length in <span class="Li">&quot;getsockopt&quot;</span>
      correctly. [perl #120835]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120835&gt;. [cpan #91183]
      &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=91183&gt;. [cpan #85570]
      &lt;https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=85570&gt;.</li>
  <li>The optimization phase of a regexp compilation could run
      &quot;forever&quot; and exhaust all memory under certain circumstances;
      now fixed. [perl #122283]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122283&gt;.</li>
  <li>The test script <i>t/op/crypt.t</i> now uses the SHA-256 algorithm if the
      default one is disabled, rather than giving failures. [perl #121591]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121591&gt;.</li>
  <li>Fixed an off-by-one error when setting the size of a shared array. [perl
      #122950] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122950&gt;.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that could cause perl to enter an infinite loop during
      compilation. In particular, a <span class="Li">while(1)</span> within a
      sublist, <i>e.g.</i>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    sub foo { () = ($a, my $b, ($c, do { while(1) {} })) }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The bug was introduced in 5.20.0 [perl #122995]
        &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=122995&gt;.</p>
  </li>
  <li>On Win32, if a variable was <span class="Li">&quot;local&quot;</span>-ized
      in a pseudo-process that later forked, restoring the original value in the
      child pseudo-process caused memory corruption and a crash in the child
      pseudo-process (and therefore the OS process). [perl #40565]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=40565&gt;.</li>
  <li>Calling <span class="Li">&quot;write&quot;</span> on a format with a
      <span class="Li">&quot;^**&quot;</span> field could produce a panic in
      <span class="Li">&quot;sv_chop()&quot;</span> if there were insufficient
      arguments or if the variable used to fill the field was empty. [perl
      #123245] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123245&gt;.</li>
  <li>Non-ASCII lexical sub names now appear without trailing junk when they
      appear in error messages.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;\@&quot;</span> subroutine prototype no longer
      flattens parenthesized arrays (taking a reference to each element), but
      takes a reference to the array itself. [perl #47363]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=47363&gt;.</li>
  <li>A block containing nothing except a C-style
      <span class="Li">&quot;for&quot;</span> loop could corrupt the stack,
      causing lists outside the block to lose elements or have elements
      overwritten. This could happen with <span class="Li">&quot;map {
      for(...){...} } ...&quot;</span> and with lists containing
      <span class="Li">&quot;do { for(...){...} }&quot;</span>. [perl #123286]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123286&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;scalar()&quot;</span> now propagates lvalue
      context, so that
      <span class="Li">&quot;for(scalar($#foo))&#x00A0;{&#x00A0;...&#x00A0;}&quot;</span>
      can modify <span class="Li">$#foo</span> through
      <span class="Li">$_</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;qr/@array(?{block})/&quot;</span> no longer dies
      with &quot;Bizarre copy of ARRAY&quot;. [perl #123344]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123344&gt;.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;eval&#x00A0;'$variable'&quot;</span> in nested
      named subroutines would sometimes look up a global variable even with a
      lexical variable in scope.</li>
  <li>In perl 5.20.0, <span class="Li">&quot;sort CORE::fake&quot;</span> where
      'fake' is anything other than a keyword, started chopping off the last 6
      characters and treating the result as a sort sub name. The previous
      behavior of treating <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::fake&quot;</span> as a
      sort sub name has been restored. [perl #123410]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123410&gt;.</li>
  <li>Outside of <span class="Li">&quot;use utf8&quot;</span>, a
      single-character Latin-1 lexical variable is disallowed. The error message
      for it, &quot;Can't use global <span class="Li">$foo</span>...&quot;, was
      giving garbage instead of the variable name.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;readline&quot;</span> on a nonexistent handle was
      causing <span class="Li">&quot;${^LAST_FH}&quot;</span> to produce a
      reference to an undefined scalar (or fail an assertion). Now
      <span class="Li">&quot;${^LAST_FH}&quot;</span> ends up undefined.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;(...) x ...&quot;</span> in void context now
      applies scalar context to the left-hand argument, instead of the context
      the current sub was called in. [perl #123020]

<p class="Pp">Brian McCauley died on May 8, 2015. He was a frequent poster to
    Usenet, Perl Monks, and other Perl forums, and made several CPAN
    contributions under the nick NOBULL, including to the Perl FAQ. He attended
    almost every YAPC::Europe, and indeed, helped organise YAPC::Europe 2006 and
    the QA Hackathon 2009. His wit and his delight in intricate systems were
    particularly apparent in his love of board games; many Perl mongers will
    have fond memories of playing Fluxx and other games with Brian. He will be
    missed.</p>
