<p class="Pp">A Perl program consists of a sequence of declarations and
    statements which run from the top to the bottom. Loops, subroutines, and
    other control structures allow you to jump around within the code.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl is a <b>free-form</b> language: you can format and indent it
    however you like. Whitespace serves mostly to separate tokens, unlike
    languages like Python where it is an important part of the syntax, or
    Fortran where it is immaterial.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of Perl's syntactic elements are <b>optional</b>. Rather than
    requiring you to put parentheses around every function call and declare
    every variable, you can often leave such explicit elements off and Perl will
    figure out what you meant. This is known as <b>Do What I</b> <b>Mean</b>,
    abbreviated <b>DWIM</b>. It allows programmers to be <b>lazy</b> and to code
    in a style with which they are comfortable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl <b>borrows syntax</b> and concepts from many languages: awk,
    sed, C, Bourne Shell, Smalltalk, Lisp and even English. Other languages have
    borrowed syntax from Perl, particularly its regular expression extensions.
    So if you have programmed in another language you will see familiar pieces
    in Perl. They often work the same, but see perltrap for information about
    how they differ.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Declarations"><a class="permalink" href="#Declarations">Declarations</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The only things you need to declare in Perl are report formats and
    subroutines (and sometimes not even subroutines). A scalar variable holds
    the undefined value (<span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>) until it has
    been assigned a defined value, which is anything other than
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>. When used as a number,
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> is treated as
    <span class="Li">0</span>; when used as a string, it is treated as the empty
    string, <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span>; and when used as a reference
    that isn't being assigned to, it is treated as an error. If you enable
    warnings, you'll be notified of an uninitialized value whenever you treat
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> as a string or a number. Well,
    usually. Boolean contexts, such as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    if ($a) {}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">are exempt from warnings (because they care about truth rather
    than definedness). Operators such as <span class="Li">&quot;++&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;--&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;+=&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;-=&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;.=&quot;</span>, that operate on undefined variables
    such as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    undef $a;
    $a++;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">are also always exempt from such warnings.</p>
<p class="Pp">A declaration can be put anywhere a statement can, but has no
    effect on the execution of the primary sequence of statements: declarations
    all take effect at compile time. All declarations are typically put at the
    beginning or the end of the script. However, if you're using
    lexically-scoped private variables created with
    <span class="Li">&quot;my()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;state()&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;our()&quot;</span>, you'll have to make sure your
    format or subroutine definition is within the same block scope as the my if
    you expect to be able to access those private variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">Declaring a subroutine allows a subroutine name to be used as if
    it were a list operator from that point forward in the program. You can
    declare a subroutine without defining it by saying
    <span class="Li">&quot;sub name&quot;</span>, thus:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    sub myname;
    $me = myname $0             or die &quot;can't get myname&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A bare declaration like that declares the function to be a list
    operator, not a unary operator, so you have to be careful to use parentheses
    (or <span class="Li">&quot;or&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span>.) The
    <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span> operator binds too tightly to use
    after list operators; it becomes part of the last element. You can always
    use parentheses around the list operators arguments to turn the list
    operator back into something that behaves more like a function call.
    Alternatively, you can use the prototype
    <span class="Li">&quot;($)&quot;</span> to turn the subroutine into a unary
    operator:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  sub myname ($);
  $me = myname $0             || die &quot;can't get myname&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That now parses as you'd expect, but you still ought to get in the
    habit of using parentheses in that situation. For more on prototypes, see
    perlsub</p>
<p class="Pp">Subroutines declarations can also be loaded up with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> statement or both loaded and
    imported into your namespace with a <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>
    statement. See perlmod for details on this.</p>
<p class="Pp">A statement sequence may contain declarations of lexically-scoped
    variables, but apart from declaring a variable name, the declaration acts
    like an ordinary statement, and is elaborated within the sequence of
    statements as if it were an ordinary statement. That means it actually has
    both compile-time and run-time effects.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Comments"><a class="permalink" href="#Comments">Comments</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Text from a <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> character until
    the end of the line is a comment, and is ignored. Exceptions include
    <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> inside a string or regular
  expression.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Simple_Statements"><a class="permalink" href="#Simple_Statements">Simple
  Statements</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The only kind of simple statement is an expression evaluated for
    its side-effects. Every simple statement must be terminated with a
    semicolon, unless it is the final statement in a block, in which case the
    semicolon is optional. But put the semicolon in anyway if the block takes up
    more than one line, because you may eventually add another line. Note that
    there are operators like <span class="Li">&quot;eval {}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;sub {}&quot;</span>, and <span class="Li">&quot;do
    {}&quot;</span> that <i>look</i> like compound statements, but
    aren't--they're just TERMs in an expression--and thus need an explicit
    termination when used as the last item in a statement.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Truth_and_Falsehood"><a class="permalink" href="#Truth_and_Falsehood">Truth
  and Falsehood</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The number 0, the strings <span class="Li">'0'</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span>, the empty list
    <span class="Li">&quot;()&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> are all false in a boolean
    context. All other values are true. Negation of a true value by
    <span class="Li">&quot;!&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;not&quot;</span> returns a special false value. When
    evaluated as a string it is treated as <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span>,
    but as a number, it is treated as 0. Most Perl operators that return true or
    false behave this way.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Statement_Modifiers"><a class="permalink" href="#Statement_Modifiers">Statement
  Modifiers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Any simple statement may optionally be followed by a <i>SINGLE</i>
    modifier, just before the terminating semicolon (or block ending). The
    possible modifiers are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    if EXPR
    unless EXPR
    while EXPR
    until EXPR
    for LIST
    foreach LIST
    when EXPR
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR&quot;</span> following the
    modifier is referred to as the &quot;condition&quot;. Its truth or falsehood
    determines how the modifier will behave.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span> executes the statement once
    <i>if</i> and only if the condition is true.
    <span class="Li">&quot;unless&quot;</span> is the opposite, it executes the
    statement <i>unless</i> the condition is true (that is, if the condition is
    false).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    print &quot;Basset hounds got long ears&quot; if length $ear &gt;= 10;
    go_outside() and play() unless $is_raining;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;for(each)&quot;</span> modifier is an
    iterator: it executes the statement once for each item in the LIST (with
    <span class="Li">$_</span> aliased to each item in turn).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    print &quot;Hello $_!\n&quot; for qw(world Dolly nurse);
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> repeats the statement
    <i>while</i> the condition is true.
    <span class="Li">&quot;until&quot;</span> does the opposite, it repeats the
    statement <i>until</i> the condition is true (or while the condition is
    false):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    # Both of these count from 0 to 10.
    print $i++ while $i &lt;= 10;
    print $j++ until $j &gt;  10;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;until&quot;</span> modifiers have the usual
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> loop&quot; semantics
    (conditional evaluated first), except when applied to a
    <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span>-BLOCK (or to the Perl4
    <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span>-SUBROUTINE statement), in which case
    the block executes once before the conditional is evaluated.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is so that you can write loops like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    do {
        $line = &lt;STDIN&gt;;
        ...
    } until !defined($line) || $line eq &quot;.\n&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">See &quot;do&quot; in perlfunc. Note also that the loop control
    statements described later will <i>NOT</i> work in this construct, because
    modifiers don't take loop labels. Sorry. You can always put another block
    inside of it (for <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>) or around it
    (for <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span>) to do that sort of thing. For
    <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>, just double the braces:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    do {{
        next if $x == $y;
        # do something here
    }} until $x++ &gt; $z;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span>, you have to be more
    elaborate:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    LOOP: { 
            do {
                last if $x = $y**2;
                # do something here
            } while $x++ &lt;= $z;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE:</b> The behaviour of a
    <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;state&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span> modified with a statement modifier
    conditional or loop construct (for example, <span class="Li">&quot;my $x if
    ...&quot;</span>) is <b>undefined</b>. The value of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span> variable may be
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>, any previously assigned value, or
    possibly anything else. Don't rely on it. Future versions of perl might do
    something different from the version of perl you try it out on. Here be
    dragons.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> modifier is an
    experimental feature that first appeared in Perl 5.14. To use it, you should
    include a <span class="Li">&quot;use v5.14&quot;</span> declaration.
    (Technically, it requires only the
    <span class="Li">&quot;switch&quot;</span> feature, but that aspect of it
    was not available before 5.14.) Operative only from within a
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop or a
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block, it executes the statement
    only if the smartmatch <span class="Li">&quot;$_ ~~
    </span><i>EXPR</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span> is true. If the statement
    executes, it is followed by a <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span> from
    inside a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;break&quot;</span> from inside a
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Under the current implementation, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop can be anywhere within the
    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> modifier's dynamic scope, but must
    be within the <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block's lexical
    scope. This restricted may be relaxed in a future release. See &quot;Switch
    Statements&quot; below.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Compound_Statements"><a class="permalink" href="#Compound_Statements">Compound
  Statements</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In Perl, a sequence of statements that defines a scope is called a
    block. Sometimes a block is delimited by the file containing it (in the case
    of a required file, or the program as a whole), and sometimes a block is
    delimited by the extent of a string (in the case of an eval).</p>
<p class="Pp">But generally, a block is delimited by curly brackets, also known
    as braces. We will call this syntactic construct a BLOCK.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following compound statements may be used to control flow:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    if (EXPR) BLOCK
    if (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK
    if (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ...
    if (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK

    unless (EXPR) BLOCK
    unless (EXPR) BLOCK else BLOCK
    unless (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ...
    unless (EXPR) BLOCK elsif (EXPR) BLOCK ... else BLOCK

    given (EXPR) BLOCK

    LABEL while (EXPR) BLOCK
    LABEL while (EXPR) BLOCK continue BLOCK

    LABEL until (EXPR) BLOCK
    LABEL until (EXPR) BLOCK continue BLOCK

    LABEL for (EXPR; EXPR; EXPR) BLOCK
    LABEL for VAR (LIST) BLOCK
    LABEL for VAR (LIST) BLOCK continue BLOCK

    LABEL foreach (EXPR; EXPR; EXPR) BLOCK
    LABEL foreach VAR (LIST) BLOCK
    LABEL foreach VAR (LIST) BLOCK continue BLOCK

    LABEL BLOCK
    LABEL BLOCK continue BLOCK

    PHASE BLOCK
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The experimental <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>
    statement is <i>not automatically enabled</i>; see &quot;Switch
    Statements&quot; below for how to do so, and the attendant caveats.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike in C and Pascal, in Perl these are all defined in terms of
    BLOCKs, not statements. This means that the curly brackets are
    <i>required</i>--no dangling statements allowed. If you want to write
    conditionals without curly brackets, there are several other ways to do it.
    The following all do the same thing:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    if (!open(FOO)) { die &quot;Can't open $FOO: $!&quot; }
    die &quot;Can't open $FOO: $!&quot; unless open(FOO);
    open(FOO)  || die &quot;Can't open $FOO: $!&quot;;
    open(FOO) ? () : die &quot;Can't open $FOO: $!&quot;;
                        # a bit exotic, that last one
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span> statement is
    straightforward. Because BLOCKs are always bounded by curly brackets, there
    is never any ambiguity about which <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span> an
    <span class="Li">&quot;else&quot;</span> goes with. If you use
    <span class="Li">&quot;unless&quot;</span> in place of
    <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span>, the sense of the test is reversed.
    Like <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;unless&quot;</span> can be followed by
    <span class="Li">&quot;else&quot;</span>.
    <span class="Li">&quot;unless&quot;</span> can even be followed by one or
    more <span class="Li">&quot;elsif&quot;</span> statements, though you may
    want to think twice before using that particular language construct, as
    everyone reading your code will have to think at least twice before they can
    understand what's going on.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> statement executes
    the block as long as the expression is true. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;until&quot;</span> statement executes the block as
    long as the expression is false. The LABEL is optional, and if present,
    consists of an identifier followed by a colon. The LABEL identifies the loop
    for the loop control statements <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;redo&quot;</span>. If the LABEL is omitted, the loop
    control statement refers to the innermost enclosing loop. This may include
    dynamically looking back your call-stack at run time to find the LABEL. Such
    desperate behavior triggers a warning if you use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;use warnings&quot;</span> pragma or the <b>-w</b>
    flag.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there is a <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span> BLOCK,
    it is always executed just before the conditional is about to be evaluated
    again. Thus it can be used to increment a loop variable, even when the loop
    has been continued via the <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>
    statement.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a block is preceding by a compilation phase keyword such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;END&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;INIT&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;CHECK&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;UNITCHECK&quot;</span>, then the block will run only
    during the corresponding phase of execution. See perlmod for more
  details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Extension modules can also hook into the Perl parser to define new
    kinds of compound statements. These are introduced by a keyword which the
    extension recognizes, and the syntax following the keyword is defined
    entirely by the extension. If you are an implementor, see
    &quot;PL_keyword_plugin&quot; in perlapi for the mechanism. If you are using
    such a module, see the module's documentation for details of the syntax that
    it defines.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Loop_Control"><a class="permalink" href="#Loop_Control">Loop
  Control</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span> command starts the
    next iteration of the loop:</p>

<pre>
    LINE: while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        next LINE if /^#/;      # discard comments
        ...

</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span> command immediately
    exits the loop in question. The <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span>
    block, if any, is not executed:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    LINE: while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        last LINE if /^$/;      # exit when done with header
        ...
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;redo&quot;</span> command restarts the
    loop block without evaluating the conditional again. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span> block, if any, is <i>not</i>
    executed. This command is normally used by programs that want to lie to
    themselves about what was just input.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, when processing a file like <i>/etc/termcap</i>. If
    your input lines might end in backslashes to indicate continuation, you want
    to skip ahead and get the next record.</p>

<p class="Pp">Note that if there were a

<p class="Pp">If the word <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> is replaced

<p class="Pp">Loop control statements don't work in an

<p class="Pp">There is one minor difference: if variables are declared with

    body of the loop and the control sections).</p>
<p class="Pp">Besides the normal array index looping,
    <span class="Li">&quot;for&quot;</span> can lend itself to many other
    interesting applications. Here's one that avoids the problem you get into if

  Loops</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop iterates over
    a normal list value and sets the variable VAR to be each element of the list
    in turn. If the variable is preceded with the keyword
    <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span>, then it is lexically scoped, and is
    therefore visible only within the loop. Otherwise, the variable is
    implicitly local to the loop and regains its former value upon exiting the
    loop. If the variable was previously declared with
    <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span>, it uses that variable instead of the
    global one, but it's still localized to the loop. This implicit localization
    occurs <i>only</i> in a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span>
  loop.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> keyword is
    actually a synonym for the <span class="Li">&quot;for&quot;</span> keyword,
    so you can use either. If VAR is omitted, <span class="Li">$_</span> is set
    to each value.</p>
<p class="Pp">If any element of LIST is an lvalue, you can modify it by
    modifying VAR inside the loop. Conversely, if any element of LIST is NOT an
    lvalue, any attempt to modify that element will fail. In other words, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop index variable is an
    implicit alias for each item in the list that you're looping over.</p>
<p class="Pp">If any part of LIST is an array,
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> will get very confused if you
    add or remove elements within the loop body, for example with
    <span class="Li">&quot;splice&quot;</span>. So don't do that.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> probably won't do what
    you expect if VAR is a tied or other special variable. Don't do that
  either.</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

    for (@ary) { s/foo/bar/ }

    for (my $i = 0; $i &lt; @ary1; $i++) {
        for (my $j = 0; $j &lt; @ary2; $j++) {

            }
            $ary1[$i] += $ary2[$j];
        }
        # this is where that last takes me
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Whereas here's how a Perl programmer more comfortable with the
    idiom might do it:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    OUTER: for my $wid (@ary1) {
    INNER:   for my $jet (@ary2) {
                next OUTER if $wid &gt; $jet;
                $wid += $jet;
             }
          }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">See how much easier this is? It's cleaner, safer, and faster. It's
    cleaner because it's less noisy. It's safer because if code gets added
    between the inner and outer loops later on, the new code won't be
    accidentally executed. The <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>
    explicitly iterates the other loop rather than merely terminating the inner
    one. And it's faster because Perl executes a
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> statement more rapidly than it
    would the equivalent <span class="Li">&quot;for&quot;</span> loop.</p>

  BLOCKs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A BLOCK by itself (labeled or not) is semantically equivalent to a
    loop that executes once. Thus you can use any of the loop control statements
    in it to leave or restart the block. (Note that this is <i>NOT</i> true in
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval{}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;sub{}&quot;</span>, or contrary to popular belief
    <span class="Li">&quot;do{}&quot;</span> blocks, which do <i>NOT</i> count

<p class="Pp">Such constructs are quite frequently used, both because older

<p class="Pp">Starting from Perl 5.10.1 (well, 5.10.0, but it didn't work
    right), you can say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use feature &quot;switch&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">to enable an experimental switch feature. This is loosely based on
    an old version of a Perl 6 proposal, but it no longer resembles the Perl 6
    construct. You also get the switch feature whenever you declare that your
    code prefers to run under a version of Perl that is 5.10 or later. For
    example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use v5.14;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Under the &quot;switch&quot; feature, Perl gains the experimental
    keywords <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;break&quot;</span>. Starting from Perl 5.16, one can
    prefix the switch keywords with <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::&quot;</span>
    to access the feature without a <span class="Li">&quot;use
    feature&quot;</span> statement. The keywords
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> are analogous to
    <span class="Li">&quot;switch&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;case&quot;</span> in other languages, so the code in
    the previous section could be rewritten as</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use v5.10.1;
    for ($var) {
        when (/^abc/) { $abc = 1 }
        when (/^def/) { $def = 1 }

        default       { $nothing = 1 }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> is the
    non-experimental way to set a topicalizer. If you wish to use the highly

<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use v5.10.1;

        default       { $nothing = 1 }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As of 5.14, that can also be written this way:</p>

<pre>
    use v5.14;
    for ($var) {
        $abc = 1 when /^abc/;
        $def = 1 when /^def/;
        $xyz = 1 when /^xyz/;
        default { $nothing = 1 }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or if you don't care to play it safe, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use v5.14;
    given ($var) {
        $abc = 1 when /^abc/;
        $def = 1 when /^def/;
        $xyz = 1 when /^xyz/;
        default { $nothing = 1 }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The arguments to <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> are in scalar context, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> assigns the
    <span class="Li">$_</span> variable its topic value.</p>
<p class="Pp">Exactly what the <i>EXPR</i> argument to
    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> does is hard to describe precisely,
    but in general, it tries to guess what you want done. Sometimes it is
    interpreted as <span class="Li">&quot;$_ ~~
    </span><i>EXPR</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>, and sometimes it is not.
    It also behaves differently when lexically enclosed by a
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block than it does when
    dynamically enclosed by a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop.
    The rules are far too difficult to understand to be described here. See
    &quot;Experimental Details on given and when&quot; later on.</p>
<p class="Pp">Due to an unfortunate bug in how
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> was implemented between Perl 5.10
    and 5.16, under those implementations the version of
    <span class="Li">$_</span> governed by
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> is merely a lexically scoped copy
    of the original, not a dynamically scoped alias to the original, as it would
    be if it were a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> or under both
    the original and the current Perl 6 language specification. This bug was
    fixed in Perl 5.18. If you really want a lexical <span class="Li">$_</span>,
    specify that explicitly, but note that <span class="Li">&quot;my
    $_&quot;</span> is now deprecated and will warn unless warnings have been
    disabled:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    given(my $_ = EXPR) { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If your code still needs to run on older versions, stick to
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> for your topicalizer and you
    will be less unhappy.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Goto"><a class="permalink" href="#Goto">Goto</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Although not for the faint of heart, Perl does support a
    <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span> statement. There are three forms:
    <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>-LABEL,
    <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>-EXPR, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>-&amp;NAME. A loop's LABEL is not
    actually a valid target for a <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>; it's
    just the name of the loop.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>-LABEL form finds the
    statement labeled with LABEL and resumes execution there. It may not be used
    to go into any construct that requires initialization, such as a subroutine
    or a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop. It also can't be used
    to go into a construct that is optimized away. It can be used to go almost
    anywhere else within the dynamic scope, including out of subroutines, but
    it's usually better to use some other construct such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>. The author of Perl has never felt
    the need to use this form of <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span> (in
    Perl, that is--C is another matter).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>-EXPR form expects a
    label name, whose scope will be resolved dynamically. This allows for
    computed <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>s per FORTRAN, but isn't
    necessarily recommended if you're optimizing for maintainability:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    goto((&quot;FOO&quot;, &quot;BAR&quot;, &quot;GLARCH&quot;)[$i]);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>-&amp;NAME form is
    highly magical, and substitutes a call to the named subroutine for the
    currently running subroutine. This is used by
    <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD()&quot;</span> subroutines that wish to load
    another subroutine and then pretend that the other subroutine had been
    called in the first place (except that any modifications to
    <span class="Li">@_</span> in the current subroutine are propagated to the
    other subroutine.) After the <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>, not
    even <span class="Li">&quot;caller()&quot;</span> will be able to tell that
    this routine was called first.</p>
<p class="Pp">In almost all cases like this, it's usually a far, far better idea
    to use the structured control flow mechanisms of
    <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;redo&quot;</span> instead of resorting to a
    <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>. For certain applications, the
    catch and throw pair of <span class="Li">&quot;eval{}&quot;</span> and
    <i>die()</i> for exception processing can also be a prudent approach.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="The_Ellipsis_Statement"><a class="permalink" href="#The_Ellipsis_Statement">The
  Ellipsis Statement</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Beginning in Perl 5.12, Perl accepts an ellipsis,
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span>&quot;, as a placeholder for
    code that you haven't implemented yet. This form of ellipsis, the
    unimplemented statement, should not be confused with the binary flip-flop
    <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> operator. One is a statement and the
    other an operator. (Perl doesn't usually confuse them because usually Perl
    can tell whether it wants an operator or a statement, but see below for
    exceptions.)</p>
<p class="Pp">When Perl 5.12 or later encounters an ellipsis statement, it
    parses this without error, but if and when you should actually try to
    execute it, Perl throws an exception with the text
    <span class="Li">&quot;Unimplemented&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use v5.12;
    sub unimplemented { ... }
    eval { unimplemented() };
    if ($@ =~ /^Unimplemented at /) {
        say &quot;I found an ellipsis!&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can only use the elliptical statement to stand in for a
    complete statement. These examples of how the ellipsis works:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use v5.12;
    { ... }
    sub foo { ... }
    ...;
    eval { ... };
    sub somemeth {
        my $self = shift;
        ...;
    }
    $x = do {
        my $n;
        ...;
        say &quot;Hurrah!&quot;;
        $n;
    };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The elliptical statement cannot stand in for an expression that is
    part of a larger statement, since the
    <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> is also the three-dot version of the
    flip-flop operator (see &quot;Range Operators&quot; in perlop).</p>
<p class="Pp">These examples of attempts to use an ellipsis are syntax
  errors:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use v5.12;

    print ...;
    open(my $fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;, &quot;/dev/passwd&quot;) or ...;
    if ($condition &amp;&amp; ... ) { say &quot;Howdy&quot; };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There are some cases where Perl can't immediately tell the
    difference between an expression and a statement. For instance, the syntax
    for a block and an anonymous hash reference constructor look the same unless
    there's something in the braces to give Perl a hint. The ellipsis is a
    syntax error if Perl doesn't guess that the <span class="Li">&quot;{ ...
    }&quot;</span> is a block. In that case, it doesn't think the
    <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> is an ellipsis because it's
    expecting an expression instead of a statement:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @transformed = map { ... } @input;  # syntax error
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can use a <span class="Li">&quot;;&quot;</span> inside your
    block to denote that the <span class="Li">&quot;{ ... }&quot;</span> is a
    block and not a hash reference constructor. Now the ellipsis works:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @transformed = map {; ... } @input; # ; disambiguates

    @transformed = map { ...; } @input; # ; disambiguates
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note: Some folks colloquially refer to this bit of punctuation as
    a &quot;yada-yada&quot; or &quot;triple-dot&quot;, but its true name is
    actually an ellipsis. Perl does not yet accept the Unicode version, U+2026
    HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS, as an alias for
    <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span>, but someday it may.</p>

    Using this, one can control Perl's idea of filenames and line numbers in
    error or warning messages (especially for strings that are processed with
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval()&quot;</span>). The syntax for this mechanism
    is almost the same as for most C preprocessors: it matches the regular

<p class="Pp">There is a fairly obvious gotcha included with the line directive:

  Details on given and when</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As previously mentioned, the &quot;switch&quot; feature is
    considered highly experimental; it is subject to change with little notice.
    In particular, <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> has tricky
    behaviours that are expected to change to become less tricky in the future.
    Do not rely upon its current (mis)implementation. Before Perl 5.18,
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> also had tricky behaviours that
    you should still beware of if your code must run on older versions of
  Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is a longer example of
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use feature &quot;:5.10&quot;;
    given ($foo) {
        when (undef) {
            say '$foo is undefined';
        }
        when (&quot;foo&quot;) {
            say '$foo is the string &quot;foo&quot;';
        }
        when ([1,3,5,7,9]) {
            say '$foo is an odd digit';
            continue; # Fall through
        }
        when ($_ &lt; 100) {
            say '$foo is numerically less than 100';
        }
        when (\&amp;complicated_check) {
            say 'a complicated check for $foo is true';
        }
        default {
            die q(I don't know what to do with $foo);
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Before Perl 5.18, <span class="Li">&quot;given(EXPR)&quot;</span>
    assigned the value of <i>EXPR</i> to merely a lexically scoped
    <i></i><b><i>copy</i></b><i></i> (!) of <span class="Li">$_</span>, not a
    dynamically scoped alias the way <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span>
    does. That made it similar to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
        do { my $_ = EXPR; ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">except that the block was automatically broken out of by a
    successful <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> or an explicit
    <span class="Li">&quot;break&quot;</span>. Because it was only a copy, and
    because it was only lexically scoped, not dynamically scoped, you could not
    do the things with it that you are used to in a
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop. In particular, it did not
    work for arbitrary function calls if those functions might try to access
    <span class="Li">$_</span>. Best stick to
    <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> for that.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most of the power comes from the implicit smartmatching that can
    sometimes apply. Most of the time,
    <span class="Li">&quot;when(EXPR)&quot;</span> is treated as an implicit
    smartmatch of <span class="Li">$_</span>, that is, <span class="Li">&quot;$_
    ~~ EXPR&quot;</span>. (See &quot;Smartmatch Operator&quot; in perlop for
    more information on smartmatching.) But when <i>EXPR</i> is one of the 10
    exceptional cases (or things like them) listed below, it is used directly as
    a boolean.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>A user-defined subroutine call or a method invocation.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>A regular expression match in the form of
      <span class="Li">&quot;/REGEX/&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;$foo
      =~ /REGEX/&quot;</span>, or <span class="Li">&quot;$foo =~
      EXPR&quot;</span>. Also, a negated regular expression match in the form
      <span class="Li">&quot;!/REGEX/&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;$foo
      !~ /REGEX/&quot;</span>, or <span class="Li">&quot;$foo !~
      EXPR&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>A smart match that uses an explicit <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span>
      operator, such as <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR ~~ EXPR&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>A boolean comparison operator such as <span class="Li">&quot;$_ &lt;
      10&quot;</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;$x eq
      &quot;abc&quot;&quot;</span>. The relational operators that this applies
      to are the six numeric comparisons
      (<span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;=&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;=&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;==&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;!=&quot;</span>), and the six string comparisons
      (<span class="Li">&quot;lt&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;gt&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;le&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;ge&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;ne&quot;</span>).
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE:</b> You will often have to use
        <span class="Li">&quot;$c ~~ $_&quot;</span> because the default case
        uses <span class="Li">&quot;$_ ~~ $c&quot;</span> , which is frequently
        the opposite of what you want.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>5.</dt>
  <dd>At least the three builtin functions
      <span class="Li">&quot;defined(...)&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;exists(...)&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;eof(...)&quot;</span>. We might someday add more of
      these later if we think of them.</dd>
  <dt>6.</dt>
  <dd>A negated expression, whether <span class="Li">&quot;!(EXPR)&quot;</span>
      or <span class="Li">&quot;not(EXPR)&quot;</span>, or a logical
      exclusive-or, <span class="Li">&quot;(EXPR1) xor (EXPR2)&quot;</span>. The
      bitwise versions (<span class="Li">&quot;~&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span>) are not included.</dd>
  <dt>7.</dt>
  <dd>A filetest operator, with exactly 4 exceptions:
      <span class="Li">&quot;-s&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;-M&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;-A&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;-C&quot;</span>, as these return numerical values,
      not boolean ones. The <span class="Li">&quot;-z&quot;</span> filetest
      operator is not included in the exception list.</dd>
  <dt>8.</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;..&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> flip-flop operators. Note that the
      <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> flip-flop operator is completely
      different from the <span class="Li">&quot;...&quot;</span> elliptical
      statement just described.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In those 8 cases above, the value of EXPR is used directly as a
    boolean, so no smartmatching is done. You may think of
    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> as a smartsmartmatch.</p>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, Perl inspects the operands of logical operators to
    decide whether to use smartmatching for each one by applying the above test
    to the operands:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>9.</dt>
  <dd>If EXPR is <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR1 &amp;&amp; EXPR2&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR1 and EXPR2&quot;</span>, the test is applied
      <i>recursively</i> to both EXPR1 and EXPR2. Only if <i>both</i> operands
      also pass the test, <i>recursively</i>, will the expression be treated as
      boolean. Otherwise, smartmatching is used.</dd>
  <dt>10.</dt>
  <dd>If EXPR is <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR1 || EXPR2&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR1 // EXPR2&quot;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR1 or EXPR2&quot;</span>, the test is applied
      <i>recursively</i> to EXPR1 only (which might itself be a
      higher-precedence AND operator, for example, and thus subject to the
      previous rule), not to EXPR2. If EXPR1 is to use smartmatching, then EXPR2
      also does so, no matter what EXPR2 contains. But if EXPR2 does not get to
      use smartmatching, then the second argument will not be either. This is
      quite different from the <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;</span>
      case just described, so be careful.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">These rules are complicated, but the goal is for them to do what
    you want (even if you don't quite understand why they are doing it). For
    example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    when (/^\d+$/ &amp;&amp; $_ &lt; 75) { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will be treated as a boolean match because the rules say both a
    regex match and an explicit test on <span class="Li">$_</span> will be
    treated as boolean.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    when ([qw(foo bar)] &amp;&amp; /baz/) { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will use smartmatching because only <i>one</i> of the operands is
    a boolean: the other uses smartmatching, and that wins.</p>
<p class="Pp">Further:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    when ([qw(foo bar)] || /^baz/) { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will use smart matching (only the first operand is considered),
    whereas</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    when (/^baz/ || [qw(foo bar)]) { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will test only the regex, which causes both operands to be treated
    as boolean. Watch out for this one, then, because an arrayref is always a
    true value, which makes it effectively redundant. Not a good idea.</p>
<p class="Pp">Tautologous boolean operators are still going to be optimized
    away. Don't be tempted to write</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    when (&quot;foo&quot; or &quot;bar&quot;) { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will optimize down to
    <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span>, so
    <span class="Li">&quot;bar&quot;</span> will never be considered (even
    though the rules say to use a smartmatch on
    <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span>). For an alternation like this, an
    array ref will work, because this will instigate smartmatching:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    when ([qw(foo bar)] { ... }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is somewhat equivalent to the C-style switch statement's
    fallthrough functionality (not to be confused with <i>Perl's</i> fallthrough
    functionality--see below), wherein the same block is used for several
    <span class="Li">&quot;case&quot;</span> statements.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another useful shortcut is that, if you use a literal array or
    hash as the argument to <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>, it is
    turned into a reference. So <span class="Li">&quot;given(@foo)&quot;</span>
    is the same as <span class="Li">&quot;given(\@foo)&quot;</span>, for
    example.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span> behaves exactly like
    <span class="Li">&quot;when(1 == 1)&quot;</span>, which is to say that it
    always matches.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Breaking out</i></p>
<p class="Pp">You can use the <span class="Li">&quot;break&quot;</span> keyword
    to break out of the enclosing <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>
    block. Every <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> block is implicitly
    ended with a <span class="Li">&quot;break&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Fall-through</i></p>
<p class="Pp">You can use the <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span>
    keyword to fall through from one case to the next:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    given($foo) {
        when (/x/) { say '$foo contains an x'; continue }
        when (/y/) { say '$foo contains a y'            }
        default    { say '$foo does not contain a y'    }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Return value</i></p>
<p class="Pp">When a <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> statement is also
    a valid expression (for example, when it's the last statement of a block),
    it evaluates to:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>An empty list as soon as an explicit
      <span class="Li">&quot;break&quot;</span> is encountered.</li>
  <li>The value of the last evaluated expression of the successful
      <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span>
      clause, if there happens to be one.</li>
  <li>The value of the last evaluated expression of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block if no condition is
    true.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">In both last cases, the last expression is evaluated in the
    context that was applied to the <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>
    block.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that, unlike <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;unless&quot;</span>, failed
    <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> statements always evaluate to an
    empty list.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    my $price = do {
        given ($item) {
            when ([&quot;pear&quot;, &quot;apple&quot;]) { 1 }
            break when &quot;vote&quot;;      # My vote cannot be bought
            1e10  when /Mona Lisa/;
            &quot;unknown&quot;;
        }
    };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Currently, <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> blocks can't
    always be used as proper expressions. This may be addressed in a future
    version of Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Switching in a loop</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of using <span class="Li">&quot;given()&quot;</span>, you
    can use a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach()&quot;</span> loop. For example,
    here's one way to count how many times a particular string occurs in an
    array:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use v5.10.1;
    my $count = 0;
    for (@array) {
        when (&quot;foo&quot;) { ++$count }
    }
    print &quot;\@array contains $count copies of 'foo'\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Or in a more recent version:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use v5.14;
    my $count = 0;
    for (@array) {
        ++$count when &quot;foo&quot;;
    }
    print &quot;\@array contains $count copies of 'foo'\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">At the end of all <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> blocks,
    there is an implicit <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>. You can
    override that with an explicit <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span> if
    you're interested in only the first match alone.</p>
<p class="Pp">This doesn't work if you explicitly specify a loop variable, as in
    <span class="Li">&quot;for $item (@array)&quot;</span>. You have to use the
    default variable <span class="Li">$_</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Differences from Perl 6</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The Perl 5 smartmatch and
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span>
    constructs are not compatible with their Perl 6 analogues. The most visible
    difference and least important difference is that, in Perl 5, parentheses
    are required around the argument to
    <span class="Li">&quot;given()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;when()&quot;</span> (except when this last one is
    used as a statement modifier). Parentheses in Perl 6 are always optional in
    a control construct such as <span class="Li">&quot;if()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;while()&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;when()&quot;</span>; they can't be made optional in
    Perl 5 without a great deal of potential confusion, because Perl 5 would
    parse the expression</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    given $foo {
        ...
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">as though the argument to
    <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> were an element of the hash
    <span class="Li">%foo</span>, interpreting the braces as hash-element
    syntax.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, their are many, many other differences. For example, this
    works in Perl 5:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use v5.12;
    my @primary = (&quot;red&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;green&quot;);

    if (@primary ~~ &quot;red&quot;) {
        say &quot;primary smartmatches red&quot;;
    }

    if (&quot;red&quot; ~~ @primary) {
        say &quot;red smartmatches primary&quot;;
    }

    say &quot;that's all, folks!&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But it doesn't work at all in Perl 6. Instead, you should use the
    (parallelizable) <span class="Li">&quot;any&quot;</span> operator
  instead:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   if any(@primary) eq &quot;red&quot; {
       say &quot;primary smartmatches red&quot;;
   }

   if &quot;red&quot; eq any(@primary) {
       say &quot;red smartmatches primary&quot;;
   }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The table of smartmatches in &quot;Smartmatch Operator&quot; in
    perlop is not identical to that proposed by the Perl 6 specification, mainly
    due to differences between Perl 6's and Perl 5's data models, but also
    because the Perl 6 spec has changed since Perl 5 rushed into early
  adoption.</p>
<p class="Pp">In Perl 6, <span class="Li">&quot;when()&quot;</span> will always
    do an implicit smartmatch with its argument, while in Perl 5 it is
    convenient (albeit potentially confusing) to suppress this implicit
    smartmatch in various rather loosely-defined situations, as roughly outlined
    above. (The difference is largely because Perl 5 does not have, even
    internally, a boolean type.)</p>
