<p class="Pp">Scalar is a repository management tool that optimizes Git for use
    in large repositories. Scalar improves performance by configuring advanced
    Git settings, maintaining repositories in the background, and helping to
    reduce data sent across the network.</p>
<p class="Pp">An important Scalar concept is the enlistment: this is the
    top-level directory of the project. It usually contains the subdirectory
    <b>src/</b> which is a Git worktree. This encourages the separation between
    tracked files (inside <b>src/</b>) and untracked files, such as build
    artifacts (outside <b>src/</b>). When registering an existing Git worktree
    with Scalar whose name is not <b>src</b>, the enlistment will be identical
    to the worktree.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>scalar</b> command implements various subcommands, and
    different options depending on the subcommand. With the exception of
    <b>clone</b>, <b>list</b> and <b>reconfigure --all</b>, all subcommands
    expect to be run in an enlistment.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following options can be specified <i>before</i> the
    subcommand:</p>
<p class="Pp">-C &lt;directory&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Before running the subcommand, change the working
  directory. This option imitates the same option of <b>git</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">-c &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For the duration of running the specified subcommand,
  configure this setting. This option imitates the same option of
  <b>git</b>(1).</div>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Clone"><a class="permalink" href="#Clone">Clone</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">clone [&lt;options&gt;] &lt;url&gt; [&lt;enlistment&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Clones the specified repository, similar to
  <b>git-clone</b>(1). By default, only commit and tree objects are cloned. Once
  finished, the worktree is located at <b>&lt;enlistment&gt;/src</b>.
<p class="Pp">The sparse-checkout feature is enabled (except when run with
    <b>--full-clone</b>) and the only files present are those in the top-level
    directory. Use <b>git sparse-checkout set</b> to expand the set of
    directories you want to see, or <b>git sparse-checkout disable</b> to expand
    to all files (see <b>git-sparse-checkout</b>(1) for more details). You can
    explore the subdirectories outside your sparse-checkout by using <b>git
    ls-tree HEAD[:&lt;directory&gt;]</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-b &lt;name&gt;, --branch &lt;name&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of checking out the branch pointed to by the
  cloned repository&#x2019;s HEAD, check out the <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> branch
  instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]single-branch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Clone only the history leading to the tip of a single
  branch, either specified by the <b>--branch</b> option or the primary branch
  remote&#x2019;s <b>HEAD</b> points at.
<p class="Pp">Further fetches into the resulting repository will only update the
    remote-tracking branch for the branch this option was used for the initial
    cloning. If the HEAD at the remote did not point at any branch when
    <b>--single-branch</b> clone was made, no remote-tracking branch is
  created.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]full-clone</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A sparse-checkout is initialized by default. This
  behavior can be turned off via <b>--full-clone</b>.</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="List"><a class="permalink" href="#List">List</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">list</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">List enlistments that are currently registered by Scalar.
  This subcommand does not need to be run inside an enlistment.</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Register"><a class="permalink" href="#Register">Register</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">register [&lt;enlistment&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Adds the enlistment&#x2019;s repository to the list of
  registered repositories and starts background maintenance. If
  <b>&lt;enlistment&gt;</b> is not provided, then the enlistment associated with
  the current working directory is registered.
<p class="Pp">Note: when this subcommand is called in a worktree that is called
    <b>src/</b>, its parent directory is considered to be the Scalar enlistment.
    If the worktree is <i>not</i> called <b>src/</b>, it itself will be
    considered to be the Scalar enlistment.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Unregister"><a class="permalink" href="#Unregister">Unregister</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">unregister [&lt;enlistment&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Remove the specified repository from the list of
  repositories registered with Scalar and stop the scheduled background
  maintenance.</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Run"><a class="permalink" href="#Run">Run</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">scalar run ( all | config | commit-graph | fetch | loose-objects |
    pack-files ) [&lt;enlistment&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Run the given maintenance task (or all tasks, if
  <b>all</b> was specified). Except for <b>all</b> and <b>config</b>, this
  subcommand simply hands off to <b>git-maintenance</b>(1) (mapping <b>fetch</b>
  to <b>prefetch</b> and <b>pack-files</b> to <b>incremental-repack</b>).
<p class="Pp">These tasks are run automatically as part of the scheduled
    maintenance, as soon as the repository is registered with Scalar. It should
    therefore not be necessary to run this subcommand manually.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>config</b> task is specific to Scalar and configures all
    those opinionated default settings that make Git work more efficiently with
    large repositories. As this task is run as part of <b>scalar clone</b>
    automatically, explicit invocations of this task are rarely needed.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Reconfigure"><a class="permalink" href="#Reconfigure">Reconfigure</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">After a Scalar upgrade, or when the configuration of a Scalar
    enlistment was somehow corrupted or changed by mistake, this subcommand
    allows to reconfigure the enlistment.</p>
<p class="Pp">With the <b>--all</b> option, all enlistments currently registered
    with Scalar will be reconfigured. Use this option after each Scalar
  upgrade.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Diagnose"><a class="permalink" href="#Diagnose">Diagnose</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">diagnose [&lt;enlistment&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When reporting issues with Scalar, it is often helpful to
  provide the information gathered by this command, including logs and certain
  statistics describing the data shape of the current enlistment.
<p class="Pp">The output of this command is a <b>.zip</b> file that is written
    into a directory adjacent to the worktree in the <b>src</b> directory.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Delete"><a class="permalink" href="#Delete">Delete</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">delete &lt;enlistment&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This subcommand lets you delete an existing Scalar
  enlistment from your local file system, unregistering the repository.</div>
