<p class="Pp">These are a few notes describing features peculiar to Plan 9 Perl.
    As such, it is not intended to be a replacement for the rest of the Perl 5
    documentation (which is both copious and excellent). If you have any
    questions to which you can't find answers in these man pages, contact Luther
    Huffman at lutherh@stratcom.com and we'll try to answer them.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Invoking_Perl"><a class="permalink" href="#Invoking_Perl">Invoking
  Perl</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl is invoked from the command line as described in perl. Most
    perl scripts, however, do have a first line such as
    &quot;#!/usr/local/bin/perl&quot;. This is known as a shebang (shell-bang)
    statement and tells the OS shell where to find the perl interpreter. In Plan
    9 Perl this statement should be &quot;#!/bin/perl&quot; if you wish to be
    able to directly invoke the script by its name.
  <br/>
   Alternatively, you may invoke perl with the command &quot;Perl&quot; instead
    of &quot;perl&quot;. This will produce Acme-friendly error messages of the
    form &quot;filename:18&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some scripts, usually identified with a *.PL extension, are
    self-configuring and are able to correctly create their own shebang path
    from config information located in Plan 9 Perl. These you won't need to be
    worried about.</p>

<p class="Pp">Although Plan 9 Perl currently only provides static loading, it is
    built with a number of useful extensions. These include Opcode, FileHandle,
    Fcntl, and POSIX. Expect to see others (and DynaLoading!) in the future.</p>

<p class="Pp">Some, such as <span class="Li">&quot;chown&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;umask&quot;</span> aren't provided because the

  AND INSTALLING PERL ON PLAN 9</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">WELCOME to Plan 9 Perl, brave soul!</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>   This is a preliminary alpha version of Plan 9 Perl. Still to be
implemented are MakeMaker and DynaLoader. Many perl commands are
missing or currently behave in an inscrutable manner. These gaps will,
with perseverance and a modicum of luck, be remedied in the near
future.To install this software:
</pre>
<p class="Pp">1. Create the source directories and libraries for perl by running
    the plan9/setup.rc command (i.e., located in the plan9 subdirectory). Note:
    the setup routine assumes that you haven't dearchived these files into
    /sys/src/cmd/perl. After running setup.rc you may delete the copy of the
    source you originally detarred, as source code has now been installed in
    /sys/src/cmd/perl. If you plan on installing perl binaries for all
    architectures, run &quot;setup.rc -a&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">2. After making sure that you have adequate privileges to build
    system software, from /sys/src/cmd/perl/5.00301 (adjust version
    appropriately) run:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        mk install
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you wish to install perl versions for all architectures (68020,
    mips, sparc and 386) run:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        mk installall
</pre>
<p class="Pp">3. Wait. The build process will take a *long* time because perl
    bootstraps itself. A 75MHz Pentium, 16MB RAM machine takes roughly 30
    minutes to build the distribution from scratch.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Installing_Perl_Documentation_on_Plan_9"><a class="permalink" href="#Installing_Perl_Documentation_on_Plan_9">Installing
  Perl Documentation on Plan 9</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This perl distribution comes with a tremendous amount of
    documentation. To add these to the built-in manuals that come with Plan 9,
    from /sys/src/cmd/perl/5.00301 (adjust version appropriately) run:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        mk man
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To begin your reading, start with:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>        man perl

<p class="Pp">This is a good introduction and will direct you towards other man
