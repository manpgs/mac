<p class="Pp">This document describes various features of HP's Unix operating
    system (HP-UX) that will affect how Perl version 5 (hereafter just Perl) is
    compiled and/or runs.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Using_perl_as_shipped_with_HP-UX"><a class="permalink" href="#Using_perl_as_shipped_with_HP-UX">Using
  perl as shipped with HP-UX</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Application release September 2001, HP-UX 11.00 is the first to
    ship with Perl. By the time it was perl-5.6.1 in /opt/perl. The first
    occurrence is on CD 5012-7954 and can be installed using</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  swinstall -s /cdrom perl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">assuming you have mounted that CD on /cdrom.</p>
<p class="Pp">That build was a portable hppa-1.1 multithread build that supports
    large files compiled with gcc-2.9-hppa-991112.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you perform a new installation, then (a newer) Perl will be
    installed automatically. Pre-installed HP-UX systems now have more recent
    versions of Perl and the updated modules.</p>
<p class="Pp">The official (threaded) builds from HP, as they are shipped on the
    Application DVD/CD's are available on
    &lt;http://www.software.hp.com/portal/swdepot/displayProductInfo.do?productNumber=PERL&gt;
    for both PA-RISC and IPF (Itanium Processor Family). They are built with the
    HP ANSI-C compiler. Up till 5.8.8 that was done by ActiveState.</p>
<p class="Pp">To see what version is included on the DVD (assumed here to be
    mounted on /cdrom), issue this command:</p>

  perl from HP's porting centre</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">HP porting centre tries to keep up with customer demand and
    release updates from the Open Source community. Having precompiled Perl
    binaries available is obvious, though &quot;up-to-date&quot; is something
    relative. At the moment of writing perl-5.10.1 and 5.28.0 were
  available.</p>
<p class="Pp">The HP porting centres are limited in what systems they are
    allowed to port to and they usually choose the two most recent OS versions
    available.</p>
<p class="Pp">HP has asked the porting centre to move Open Source binaries from
    /opt to /usr/local, so binaries produced since the start of July 2002 are
    located in /usr/local.</p>
<p class="Pp">One of HP porting centres URL's is
    &lt;http://hpux.connect.org.uk/&gt; The port currently available is built
    with GNU gcc. As porting modern GNU gcc is extremely hard on HP-UX, they are
    stuck at version gcc-4.2.3.</p>

  Perl 5 on HP-UX</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When compiling Perl, you must use an ANSI C compiler. The C
    compiler that ships with all HP-UX systems is a K&amp;R compiler that should
    only be used to build new kernels.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl can be compiled with either HP's ANSI C compiler or with gcc.
    The former is recommended, as not only can it compile Perl with no
    difficulty, but also can take advantage of features listed later that
    require the use of HP compiler-specific command-line flags.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you decide to use gcc, make sure your installation is recent
    and complete, and be sure to read the Perl INSTALL file for more
    gcc-specific details.</p>

<p class="Pp">The last and final version of PA-RISC is 2.0, HP no longer sells
    any system with these CPU's.</p>
<p class="Pp">HP's HP9000 Unix systems run on HP's own Precision Architecture
    (PA-RISC) chip. HP-UX used to run on the Motorola MC68000 family of chips,
    but any machine with this chip in it is quite obsolete and this document
    will not attempt to address issues for compiling Perl on the Motorola
    chipset. Even though PA-RISC hardware is not sold anymore, a lot of machines
    still running on these CPU's can be found in the wild.</p>
<p class="Pp">The last order date for HP 9000 systems was December 31, 2008.</p>
<p class="Pp">HP PA-RISC systems are usually referred to with model description
    &quot;HP 9000&quot;. The last CPU in this series is the PA-8900. Support for
    PA-RISC architectured machines officially ended as shown in the following

<h2 class="Ss" id="Building_Dynamic_Extensions_on_HP-UX"><a class="permalink" href="#Building_Dynamic_Extensions_on_HP-UX">Building
  Dynamic Extensions on HP-UX</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">HP-UX supports dynamically loadable libraries (shared libraries).
    Shared libraries end with the suffix .sl. On Itanium systems, they end with
    the suffix .so.</p>
<p class="Pp">Shared libraries created on a platform using a particular PA-RISC
    version are not usable on platforms using an earlier PA-RISC version by
    default. However, this backwards compatibility may be enabled using the same
    +DAportable compiler flag (with the same PA-RISC 1.0 caveat mentioned
    above).</p>
<p class="Pp">Shared libraries created on an Itanium platform cannot be loaded
    on a PA-RISC platform. Shared libraries created on a PA-RISC platform can
    only be loaded on an Itanium platform if it is a PA-RISC executable that is
    attempting to load the PA-RISC library. A PA-RISC shared library cannot be
    loaded into an Itanium executable nor vice-versa.</p>
<p class="Pp">To create a shared library, the following steps must be
  performed:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  1. Compile source modules with +z or +Z flag to create a .o module
     which contains Position-Independent Code (PIC).  The linker will
     tell you in the next step if +Z was needed.
     (For gcc, the appropriate flag is -fpic or -fPIC.)
  2. Link the shared library using the -b flag.  If the code calls
     any functions in other system libraries (e.g., libm), it must
     be included on this line.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(Note that these steps are usually handled automatically by the
    extension's Makefile).</p>
<p class="Pp">If these dependent libraries are not listed at shared library
    creation time, you will get fatal &quot;Unresolved symbol&quot; errors at
    run time when the library is loaded.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may create a shared library that refers to another library,
    which may be either an archive library or a shared library. If this second
    library is a shared library, this is called a &quot;dependent library&quot;.
    The dependent library's name is recorded in the main shared library, but it
    is not linked into the shared library. Instead, it is loaded when the main
    shared library is loaded. This can cause problems if you build an extension
    on one system and move it to another system where the libraries may not be
    located in the same place as on the first system.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the referred library is an archive library, then it is treated
    as a simple collection of .o modules (all of which must contain PIC). These
    modules are then linked into the shared library.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that it is okay to create a library which contains a
    dependent library that is already linked into perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some extensions, like DB_File and Compress::Zlib use/require
    prebuilt libraries for the perl extensions/modules to work. If these
    libraries are built using the default configuration, it might happen that
    you run into an error like &quot;invalid loader fixup&quot; during load
    phase. HP is aware of this problem. Search the HP-UX cxx-dev forums for
    discussions about the subject. The short answer is that <b>everything</b>
    (all libraries, everything) must be compiled with
    <span class="Li">&quot;+z&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;+Z&quot;</span> to be PIC (position independent
    code). (For gcc, that would be <span class="Li">&quot;-fpic&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;-fPIC&quot;</span>). In HP-UX 11.00 or newer the
    linker error message should tell the name of the offending object file.</p>
<p class="Pp">A more general approach is to intervene manually, as with an
    example for the DB_File module, which requires SleepyCat's libdb.sl:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  # cd .../db-3.2.9/build_unix
  # vi Makefile
  ... add +Z to all cflags to create shared objects
  CFLAGS=         -c $(CPPFLAGS) +Z -Ae +O2 +Onolimit \
                  -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include/X11R6
  CXXFLAGS=       -c $(CPPFLAGS) +Z -Ae +O2 +Onolimit \
                  -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include/X11R6
  # make clean
  # make
  # mkdir tmp
  # cd tmp
  # ar x ../libdb.a
  # ld -b -o libdb-3.2.sl *.o
  # mv libdb-3.2.sl /usr/local/lib
  # rm *.o
  # cd /usr/local/lib
  # rm -f libdb.sl
  # ln -s libdb-3.2.sl libdb.sl
  # cd .../DB_File-1.76
  # make distclean
  # perl Makefile.PL
  # make
  # make test
  # make install
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As of db-4.2.x it is no longer needed to do this by hand.
    Sleepycat has changed the configuration process to add +z on HP-UX
    automatically.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  # cd .../db-4.2.25/build_unix
  # env CFLAGS=+DD64 LDFLAGS=+DD64 ../dist/configure
</pre>
<p class="Pp">should work to generate 64bit shared libraries for HP-UX 11.00 and
    11i.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is no longer possible to link PA-RISC 1.0 shared libraries
    (even though the command-line flags are still present).</p>
<p class="Pp">PA-RISC and Itanium object files are not interchangeable. Although
    you may be able to use ar to create an archive library of PA-RISC object
    files on an Itanium system, you cannot link against it using an Itanium link
    editor.</p>

<h2 class="Ss">The HP ANSI C Compiler</h2>
<p class="Pp">When using this compiler to build Perl, you should make sure that
    the flag -Aa is added to the cpprun and cppstdin variables in the config.sh
    file (though see the section on 64-bit perl below). If you are using a
    recent version of the Perl distribution, these flags are set
  automatically.</p>
<p class="Pp">Even though HP-UX 10.20 and 11.00 are not actively maintained by
    HP anymore, updates for the HP ANSI C compiler are still available from time
    to time, and it might be advisable to see if updates are applicable. At the
    moment of writing, the latests available patches for 11.00 that should be
    applied are PHSS_35098, PHSS_35175, PHSS_35100, PHSS_33036, and PHSS_33902).

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">The GNU C Compiler</h2>
<p class="Pp">When you are going to use the GNU C compiler (gcc), and you don't
    have gcc yet, you can either build it yourself (if you feel masochistic
    enough) from the sources (available from e.g.
    &lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/mirrors.html&gt;) or fetch a prebuilt binary from the
    HP porting center at
    &lt;http://hpux.connect.org.uk/hppd/cgi-bin/search?term=gcc&amp;Search=Search&gt;
    or from the DSPP (you need to be a member) at
    &lt;http://h21007.www2.hp.com/portal/site/dspp/menuitem.863c3e4cbcdc3f3515b49c108973a801?ciid=2a08725cc2f02110725cc2f02110275d6e10RCRD&amp;jumpid=reg_r1002_usen_c-001_title_r0001&gt;
    (Browse through the list, because there are often multiple versions of the
    same package available).</p>
<p class="Pp">Most mentioned distributions are depots. H.Merijn Brand has made
    prebuilt gcc binaries available on
    &lt;http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/&gt; and/or
    &lt;http://www.cmve.net/~merijn/&gt; for HP-UX 10.20 (only 32bit), HP-UX
    11.00, HP-UX 11.11 (HP-UX 11i v1), and HP-UX 11.23 (HP-UX 11i v2 PA-RISC) in
    both 32- and 64-bit versions. For HP-UX 11.23 IPF and HP-UX 11.31 IPF depots
    are available too. The IPF versions do not need two versions of GNU gcc.</p>
<p class="Pp">On PA-RISC you need a different compiler for 32-bit applications
    and for 64-bit applications. On PA-RISC, 32-bit objects and 64-bit objects
    do not mix. Period. There is no different behaviour for HP C-ANSI-C or GNU
    gcc. So if you require your perl binary to use 64-bit libraries, like
    Oracle-64bit, you MUST build a 64-bit perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Building a 64-bit capable gcc on PA-RISC from source is possible
    only when you have the HP C-ANSI C compiler or an already working 64-bit
    binary of gcc available. Best performance for perl is achieved with HP's
    native compiler.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Using_Large_Files_with_Perl_on_HP-UX"><a class="permalink" href="#Using_Large_Files_with_Perl_on_HP-UX">Using
  Large Files with Perl on HP-UX</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Beginning with HP-UX version 10.20, files larger than 2GB (2^31
    bytes) may be created and manipulated. Three separate methods of doing this
    are available. Of these methods, the best method for Perl is to compile
    using the -Duselargefiles flag to Configure. This causes Perl to be compiled
    using structures and functions in which these are 64 bits wide, rather than
    32 bits wide. (Note that this will only work with HP's ANSI C compiler. If
    you want to compile Perl using gcc, you will have to get a version of the
    compiler that supports 64-bit operations. See above for where to find
  it.)</p>
<p class="Pp">There are some drawbacks to this approach. One is that any
    extension which calls any file-manipulating C function will need to be
    recompiled (just follow the usual &quot;perl Makefile.PL; make; make test;
    make install&quot; procedure).</p>
<p class="Pp">The list of functions that will need to recompiled is:
  <br/>
   creat, fgetpos, fopen,
  <br/>
   freopen, fsetpos, fstat,
  <br/>
   fstatvfs, fstatvfsdev, ftruncate,
  <br/>
   ftw, lockf, lseek,
  <br/>
   lstat, mmap, nftw,
  <br/>
   open, prealloc, stat,
  <br/>
   statvfs, statvfsdev, tmpfile,
  <br/>
   truncate, getrlimit, setrlimit</p>
<p class="Pp">Another drawback is only valid for Perl versions before 5.6.0.
    This drawback is that the seek and tell functions (both the builtin version
    and POSIX module version) will not perform correctly.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is strongly recommended that you use this flag when you run
    Configure. If you do not do this, but later answer the question about large
    files when Configure asks you, you may get a configuration that cannot be
    compiled, or that does not function as expected.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Threaded_Perl_on_HP-UX"><a class="permalink" href="#Threaded_Perl_on_HP-UX">Threaded
  Perl on HP-UX</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">It is possible to compile a version of threaded Perl on any
    version of HP-UX before 10.30, but it is strongly suggested that you be
    running on HP-UX 11.00 at least.</p>
<p class="Pp">To compile Perl with threads, add -Dusethreads to the arguments of
    Configure. Verify that the -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L compiler flag is
    automatically added to the list of flags. Also make sure that -lpthread is
    listed before -lc in the list of libraries to link Perl with. The hints
    provided for HP-UX during Configure will try very hard to get this right for
    you.</p>
<p class="Pp">HP-UX versions before 10.30 require a separate installation of a
    POSIX threads library package. Two examples are the HP DCE package,
    available on &quot;HP-UX Hardware Extensions 3.0, Install and Core OS,
    Release 10.20, April 1999 (B3920-13941)&quot; or the Freely available PTH
    package, available on H.Merijn's site
    (&lt;http://mirrors.develooper.com/hpux/&gt;). The use of PTH will be
    unsupported in perl-5.12 and up and is rather buggy in 5.11.x.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are going to use the HP DCE package, the library used for
    threading is /usr/lib/libcma.sl, but there have been multiple updates of
    that library over time. Perl will build with the first version, but it will
    not pass the test suite. Older Oracle versions might be a compelling reason
    not to update that library, otherwise please find a newer version in one of
    the following patches: PHSS_19739, PHSS_20608, or PHSS_23672</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="64"><a class="permalink" href="#64">64-bit Perl on
  HP-UX</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Beginning with HP-UX 11.00, programs compiled under HP-UX can take
    advantage of the LP64 programming environment (LP64 means Longs and Pointers
    are 64 bits wide), in which scalar variables will be able to hold numbers
    larger than 2^32 with complete precision. Perl has proven to be consistent
    and reliable in 64bit mode since 5.8.1 on all HP-UX 11.xx.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of the date of this document, Perl is fully 64-bit compliant on
    HP-UX 11.00 and up for both cc- and gcc builds. If you are about to build a
    64-bit perl with GNU gcc, please read the gcc section carefully.</p>
<p class="Pp">Should a user have the need for compiling Perl in the LP64
    environment, use the -Duse64bitall flag to Configure. This will force Perl
    to be compiled in a pure LP64 environment (with the +DD64 flag for HP
    C-ANSI-C, with no additional options for GNU gcc 64-bit on PA-RISC, and with
    -mlp64 for GNU gcc on Itanium). If you want to compile Perl using gcc, you
    will have to get a version of the compiler that supports 64-bit
  operations.)</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also use the -Duse64bitint flag to Configure. Although
    there are some minor differences between compiling Perl with this flag
    versus the -Duse64bitall flag, they should not be noticeable from a Perl
    user's perspective. When configuring -Duse64bitint using a 64bit gcc on a
    pa-risc architecture, -Duse64bitint is silently promoted to
  -Duse64bitall.</p>
<p class="Pp">In both cases, it is strongly recommended that you use these flags
    when you run Configure. If you do not use do this, but later answer the
    questions about 64-bit numbers when Configure asks you, you may get a
    configuration that cannot be compiled, or that does not function as
    expected.</p>

<p class="Pp">By default, HP-UX comes configured with a maximum data segment
    size of 64MB. This is too small to correctly compile Perl with the maximum
    optimization levels. You can increase the size of the maxdsiz kernel
    parameter through the use of SAM.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using the GUI version of SAM, click on the Kernel
    Configuration icon, then the Configurable Parameters icon. Scroll down and
    select the maxdsiz line. From the Actions menu, select the Modify
    Configurable Parameter item. Insert the new formula into the Formula/Value
    box. Then follow the instructions to rebuild your kernel and reboot your
    system.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, a value of 256MB (or &quot;256*1024*1024&quot;) is
    sufficient for Perl to compile at maximum optimization.</p>
