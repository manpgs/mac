<p class="Pp">This document describes differences between the 5.22.0 release and

  5.22.0.</p>

<p class="Pp">There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.20.0 other
    than the following single exception, which we deemed to be a sensible change
    to make in order to get the new <span class="Li">&quot;\b{wb}&quot;</span>
    and (in particular) <span class="Li">&quot;\b{sb}&quot;</span> features sane
    before people decided they're worthless because of bugs in their Perl 5.22.0
    implementation and avoided them in the future. If any others exist, they are
    bugs, and we request that you submit a report. See &quot;Reporting

  <li>Regular expression possessive quantifier Perl 5.20 regression now fixed.

      [GH #14857] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14857&gt;</li>
  <li>Certain syntax errors in &quot;Extended Bracketed Character Classes&quot;
      in perlrecharclass caused panics instead of the proper error message. This
      has now been fixed. [GH #15016]

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN &lt;&gt;&quot;</span> no longer segfaults and
      properly produces an error message. [GH #13546]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/13546&gt;</li>
  <li>A regression from Perl 5.20 has been fixed, in which some syntax errors in
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?[...])&quot;</span> constructs within regular
      expression patterns could cause a segfault instead of a proper error
      message. [GH #14933]
    &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14933&gt;</li>
  <li>Another problem with <span class="Li">&quot;(?[...])&quot;</span>
      constructs has been fixed wherein things like
      <span class="Li">&quot;\c]&quot;</span> could cause panics. [GH #14934]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14934&gt;</li>
  <li>In Perl 5.22.0, the logic changed when parsing a numeric parameter to the
      -C option, such that the successfully parsed number was not saved as the
      option value if it parsed to the end of the argument. [GH #14748]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14748&gt;</li>
  <li>Warning fatality is now ignored when rewinding the stack. This prevents
      infinite recursion when the now fatal error also causes rewinding of the
      stack. [GH #14319] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14319&gt;</li>
  <li>A crash with <span class="Li">&quot;%::=();
      J-&gt;${\&quot;::&quot;}&quot;</span> has been fixed. [GH #14790]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14790&gt;</li>
  <li>Nested quantifiers such as <span class="Li">&quot;/.{1}??/&quot;</span>
      should cause perl to throw a fatal error, but were being silently accepted
      since Perl 5.20.0. This has been fixed. [GH #14960]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14960&gt;</li>
  <li>Regular expression sequences such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;/(?i/&quot;</span> (and similarly with other
      recognized flags or combination of flags) should cause perl to throw a
      fatal error, but were being silently accepted since Perl 5.18.0. This has
      been fixed. [GH #14931]
    &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/14931&gt;</li>
  <li>A bug in hexadecimal floating point literal support meant that high-order
      bits could be lost in cases where mantissa overflow was caused by too many
      trailing zeros in the fractional part. This has been fixed. [GH #15032]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15032&gt;</li>
  <li>Another hexadecimal floating point bug, causing low-order bits to be lost
      in cases where the last hexadecimal digit of the mantissa has bits
      straddling the limit of the number of bits allowed for the mantissa, has
      also been fixed. [GH #15033]
      &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15033&gt;</li>
  <li>Further hexadecimal floating point bugs have been fixed: In some
      circumstances, the <span class="Li">%a</span> format specifier could
      variously lose the sign of the negative zero, fail to display zeros after
      the radix point with the requested precision, or even lose the radix point
      after the leftmost hexadecimal digit completely.</li>
  <li>A crash caused by incomplete expressions within
      <span class="Li">&quot;/(?[ ])/&quot;</span> (e.g.
      <span class="Li">&quot;/(?[[0]+()+])/&quot;</span>) has been fixed. [GH
      #15045] &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15045&gt;</li>

<p class="Pp">Perl 5.22.1 represents approximately 6 months of development since
    Perl 5.22.0 and contains approximately 19,000 lines of changes across 130
    files from 27 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 1,700 lines of changes to 44 .pm, .t, .c and .h
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.22.1:</p>
<p class="Pp">Aaron Crane, Abigail, Andy Broad, Aristotle Pagaltzis, Chase
    Whitener, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, Daniel Dragan, David
    Mitchell, Father Chrysostomos, Herbert Breunung, Hugo van der Sanden, James

    Lukas Mai, Matthew Horsfall, Peter Martini, Rafael Garcia-Suarez, Ricardo
    Signes, Shlomi Fish, Sisyphus, Steve Hay, Tony Cook, Victor Adam.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<p class="Pp">If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
    recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
    database at https://rt.perl.org/ . There may also be information at
    http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
    a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
