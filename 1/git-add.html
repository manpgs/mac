<p class="Pp">This command updates the index using the current content found in
    the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit. It
    typically adds the current content of existing paths as a whole, but with
    some options it can also be used to add content with only part of the
    changes made to the working tree files applied, or remove paths that do not
    exist in the working tree anymore.</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;index&quot; holds a snapshot of the content of the
    working tree, and it is this snapshot that is taken as the contents of the
    next commit. Thus after making any changes to the working tree, and before
    running the commit command, you must use the <b>add</b> command to add any
    new or modified files to the index.</p>
<p class="Pp">This command can be performed multiple times before a commit. It
    only adds the content of the specified file(s) at the time the add command
    is run; if you want subsequent changes included in the next commit, then you
    must run <b>git add</b> again to add the new content to the index.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>git status</b> command can be used to obtain a summary of
    which files have changes that are staged for the next commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>git add</b> command will not add ignored files by default.
    If any ignored files were explicitly specified on the command line, <b>git
    add</b> will fail with a list of ignored files. Ignored files reached by
    directory recursion or filename globbing performed by Git (quote your globs
    before the shell) will be silently ignored. The <i>git add</i> command can
    be used to add ignored files with the <b>-f</b> (force) option.</p>
<p class="Pp">Please see <b>git-commit</b>(1) for alternative ways to add
    content to a commit.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">&lt;pathspec&gt;...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Files to add content from. Fileglobs (e.g. <b>*.c</b>)
  can be given to add all matching files. Also a leading directory name (e.g.
  <b>dir</b> to add <b>dir/file1</b> and <b>dir/file2</b>) can be given to
  update the index to match the current state of the directory as a whole (e.g.
  specifying <b>dir</b> will record not just a file <b>dir/file1</b> modified in
  the working tree, a file <b>dir/file2</b> added to the working tree, but also
  a file <b>dir/file3</b> removed from the working tree). Note that older
  versions of Git used to ignore removed files; use <b>--no-all</b> option if
  you want to add modified or new files but ignore removed ones.
<p class="Pp">For more details about the &lt;pathspec&gt; syntax, see the
    <i>pathspec</i> entry in <b>gitglossary</b>(7).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-n, --dry-run</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Don&#x2019;t actually add the file(s), just show if they
  exist and/or will be ignored.</div>
<p class="Pp">-v, --verbose</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Be verbose.</div>
<p class="Pp">-f, --force</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow adding otherwise ignored files.</div>
<p class="Pp">-i, --interactive</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Add modified contents in the working tree interactively
  to the index. Optional path arguments may be supplied to limit operation to a
  subset of the working tree. See &#x201C;Interactive mode&#x201D; for
  details.</div>
<p class="Pp">-p, --patch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Interactively choose hunks of patch between the index and
  the work tree and add them to the index. This gives the user a chance to
  review the difference before adding modified contents to the index.
<p class="Pp">This effectively runs <b>add --interactive</b>, but bypasses the
    initial command menu and directly jumps to the <b>patch</b> subcommand. See
    &#x201C;Interactive mode&#x201D; for details.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-e, --edit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Open the diff vs. the index in an editor and let the user
  edit it. After the editor was closed, adjust the hunk headers and apply the
  patch to the index.
<p class="Pp">The intent of this option is to pick and choose lines of the patch
    to apply, or even to modify the contents of lines to be staged. This can be
    quicker and more flexible than using the interactive hunk selector. However,
    it is easy to confuse oneself and create a patch that does not apply to the
    index. See EDITING PATCHES below.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-u, --update</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Update the index just where it already has an entry
  matching &lt;pathspec&gt;. This removes as well as modifies index entries to
  match the working tree, but adds no new files.
<p class="Pp">If no &lt;pathspec&gt; is given when <b>-u</b> option is used, all
    tracked files in the entire working tree are updated (old versions of Git
    used to limit the update to the current directory and its
  subdirectories).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-A, --all, --no-ignore-removal</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Update the index not only where the working tree has a
  file matching &lt;pathspec&gt; but also where the index already has an entry.
  This adds, modifies, and removes index entries to match the working tree.
<p class="Pp">If no &lt;pathspec&gt; is given when <b>-A</b> option is used, all
    files in the entire working tree are updated (old versions of Git used to
    limit the update to the current directory and its subdirectories).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-all, --ignore-removal</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Update the index by adding new files that are unknown to
  the index and files modified in the working tree, but ignore files that have
  been removed from the working tree. This option is a no-op when no
  &lt;pathspec&gt; is used.
<p class="Pp">This option is primarily to help users who are used to older
    versions of Git, whose &quot;git add &lt;pathspec&gt;...&quot; was a synonym
    for &quot;git add --no-all &lt;pathspec&gt;...&quot;, i.e. ignored removed
    files.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-N, --intent-to-add</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Record only the fact that the path will be added later.
  An entry for the path is placed in the index with no content. This is useful
  for, among other things, showing the unstaged content of such files with
  <b>git diff</b> and committing them with <b>git commit -a</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--refresh</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Don&#x2019;t add the file(s), but only refresh their
  stat() information in the index.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-errors</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If some files could not be added because of errors
  indexing them, do not abort the operation, but continue adding the others. The
  command shall still exit with non-zero status. The configuration variable
  <b>add.ignoreErrors</b> can be set to true to make this the default
  behaviour.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-missing</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option can only be used together with --dry-run. By
  using this option the user can check if any of the given files would be
  ignored, no matter if they are already present in the work tree or not.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-warn-embedded-repo</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, <b>git add</b> will warn when adding an
  embedded repository to the index without using <b>git submodule add</b> to
  create an entry in <b>.gitmodules</b>. This option will suppress the warning
  (e.g., if you are manually performing operations on submodules).</div>
<p class="Pp">--renormalize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Apply the &quot;clean&quot; process freshly to all
  tracked files to forcibly add them again to the index. This is useful after
  changing <b>core.autocrlf</b> configuration or the <b>text</b> attribute in
  order to correct files added with wrong CRLF/LF line endings. This option
  implies <b>-u</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--chmod=(+|-)x</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Override the executable bit of the added files. The
  executable bit is only changed in the index, the files on disk are left
  unchanged.</div>
<p class="Pp">--pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pathspec is passed in <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> instead of
  commandline args. If <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> is exactly <b>-</b> then standard
  input is used. Pathspec elements are separated by LF or CR/LF. Pathspec
  elements can be quoted as explained for the configuration variable
  <b>core.quotePath</b> (see <b>git-config</b>(1)). See also
  <b>--pathspec-file-nul</b> and global <b>--literal-pathspecs</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--pathspec-file-nul</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only meaningful with <b>--pathspec-from-file</b>.
  Pathspec elements are separated with NUL character and all other characters
  are taken literally (including newlines and quotes).</div>
<p class="Pp">--</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option can be used to separate command-line options
  from the list of files, (useful when filenames might be mistaken for
  command-line options).</div>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Adds content from all <b>*.txt</b> files under
  <b>Documentation</b> directory and its subdirectories:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git add Documentation/\*.txt
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that the asterisk <b>*</b> is quoted from the shell in this
    example; this lets the command include the files from subdirectories of
    <b>Documentation/</b> directory.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Considers adding content from all git-*.sh
  scripts:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git add git-*.sh
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Because this example lets the shell expand the asterisk (i.e. you
    are listing the files explicitly), it does not consider
    <b>subdir/git-foo.sh</b>.</p>
</div>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INTERACTIVE_MODE"><a class="permalink" href="#INTERACTIVE_MODE">INTERACTIVE
  MODE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When the command enters the interactive mode, it shows the output
    of the <i>status</i> subcommand, and then goes into its interactive command
    loop.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command loop shows the list of subcommands available, and
    gives a prompt &quot;What now&gt; &quot;. In general, when the prompt ends
    with a single <i>&gt;</i>, you can pick only one of the choices given and
    type return, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
    *** Commands ***
      1: status       2: update       3: revert       4: add untracked
      5: patch        6: diff         7: quit         8: help
    What now&gt; 1
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">You also could say <b>s</b> or <b>sta</b> or <b>status</b> above
    as long as the choice is unique.</p>
<p class="Pp">The main command loop has 6 subcommands (plus help and quit).</p>
<p class="Pp">status</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This shows the change between HEAD and index (i.e. what
  will be committed if you say <b>git commit</b>), and between index and working
  tree files (i.e. what you could stage further before <b>git commit</b> using
  <b>git add</b>) for each path. A sample output looks like this:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
              staged     unstaged path
     1:       binary      nothing foo.png
     2:     +403/-35        +1/-1 git-add--interactive.perl
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">It shows that foo.png has differences from HEAD (but that is
    binary so line count cannot be shown) and there is no difference between
    indexed copy and the working tree version (if the working tree version were
    also different, <i>binary</i> would have been shown in place of
    <i>nothing</i>). The other file, git-add--interactive.perl, has 403 lines
    added and 35 lines deleted if you commit what is in the index, but working
    tree file has further modifications (one addition and one deletion).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">update</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This shows the status information and issues an
  &quot;Update&gt;&gt;&quot; prompt. When the prompt ends with double
  <i>&gt;&gt;</i>, you can make more than one selection, concatenated with
  whitespace or comma. Also you can say ranges. E.g. &quot;2-5 7,9&quot; to
  choose 2,3,4,5,7,9 from the list. If the second number in a range is omitted,
  all remaining patches are taken. E.g. &quot;7-&quot; to choose 7,8,9 from the
  list. You can say <i>*</i> to choose everything.
<p class="Pp">What you chose are then highlighted with <i>*</i>, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
           staged     unstaged path
  1:       binary      nothing foo.png
* 2:     +403/-35        +1/-1 git-add--interactive.perl
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">To remove selection, prefix the input with <b>-</b> like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
Update&gt;&gt; -2
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">After making the selection, answer with an empty line to stage the
    contents of working tree files for selected paths in the index.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">revert</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This has a very similar UI to <i>update</i>, and the
  staged information for selected paths are reverted to that of the HEAD
  version. Reverting new paths makes them untracked.</div>
<p class="Pp">add untracked</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This has a very similar UI to <i>update</i> and
  <i>revert</i>, and lets you add untracked paths to the index.</div>
<p class="Pp">patch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This lets you choose one path out of a <i>status</i> like
  selection. After choosing the path, it presents the diff between the index and
  the working tree file and asks you if you want to stage the change of each
  hunk. You can select one of the following options and type return:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
y - stage this hunk
n - do not stage this hunk
q - quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining ones
a - stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file
d - do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the file
g - select a hunk to go to
/ - search for a hunk matching the given regex
j - leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk
J - leave this hunk undecided, see next hunk
k - leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk
K - leave this hunk undecided, see previous hunk
s - split the current hunk into smaller hunks
e - manually edit the current hunk
? - print help
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">After deciding the fate for all hunks, if there is any hunk that
    was chosen, the index is updated with the selected hunks.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can omit having to type return here, by setting the
    configuration variable <b>interactive.singleKey</b> to <b>true</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">diff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This lets you review what will be committed (i.e. between
  HEAD and index).</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EDITING_PATCHES"><a class="permalink" href="#EDITING_PATCHES">EDITING
  PATCHES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Invoking <b>git add -e</b> or selecting <b>e</b> from the
    interactive hunk selector will open a patch in your editor; after the editor
    exits, the result is applied to the index. You are free to make arbitrary
    changes to the patch, but note that some changes may have confusing results,
    or even result in a patch that cannot be applied. If you want to abort the
    operation entirely (i.e., stage nothing new in the index), simply delete all
    lines of the patch. The list below describes some common things you may see
    in a patch, and which editing operations make sense on them.</p>
<p class="Pp">added content</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Added content is represented by lines beginning with
  &quot;+&quot;. You can prevent staging any addition lines by deleting
  them.</div>
<p class="Pp">removed content</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Removed content is represented by lines beginning with
  &quot;-&quot;. You can prevent staging their removal by converting the
  &quot;-&quot; to a &quot; &quot; (space).</div>
<p class="Pp">modified content</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Modified content is represented by &quot;-&quot; lines
  (removing the old content) followed by &quot;+&quot; lines (adding the
  replacement content). You can prevent staging the modification by converting
  &quot;-&quot; lines to &quot; &quot;, and removing &quot;+&quot; lines. Beware
  that modifying only half of the pair is likely to introduce confusing changes
  to the index.</div>
<p class="Pp">There are also more complex operations that can be performed. But
    beware that because the patch is applied only to the index and not the
    working tree, the working tree will appear to &quot;undo&quot; the change in
    the index. For example, introducing a new line into the index that is in
    neither the HEAD nor the working tree will stage the new line for commit,
    but the line will appear to be reverted in the working tree.</p>
<p class="Pp">Avoid using these constructs, or do so with extreme caution.</p>
<p class="Pp">removing untouched content</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Content which does not differ between the index and
  working tree may be shown on context lines, beginning with a &quot; &quot;
  (space). You can stage context lines for removal by converting the space to a
  &quot;-&quot;. The resulting working tree file will appear to re-add the
  content.</div>
<p class="Pp">modifying existing content</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">One can also modify context lines by staging them for
  removal (by converting &quot; &quot; to &quot;-&quot;) and adding a
  &quot;+&quot; line with the new content. Similarly, one can modify
  &quot;+&quot; lines for existing additions or modifications. In all cases, the
  new modification will appear reverted in the working tree.</div>
<p class="Pp">new content</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">You may also add new content that does not exist in the
  patch; simply add new lines, each starting with &quot;+&quot;. The addition
  will appear reverted in the working tree.</div>
<p class="Pp">There are also several operations which should be avoided
    entirely, as they will make the patch impossible to apply:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;adding context (&quot; &quot;) or removal
  (&quot;-&quot;) lines</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;deleting context or removal lines</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;modifying the contents of context or removal
  lines</div>
