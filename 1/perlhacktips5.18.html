<p class="Pp">This document will help you learn the best way to go about hacking
    on the Perl core C code. It covers common problems, debugging, profiling,
    and more.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you haven't read perlhack and perlhacktut yet, you might want
    to do that first.</p>

  PROBLEMS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Perl source plays by ANSI C89 rules: no C99 (or C++) extensions.
    In some cases we have to take pre-ANSI requirements into consideration. You
    don't care about some particular platform having broken Perl? I hear there
    is still a strong demand for J2EE programmers.</p>

  environment problems</a></h2>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Not compiling with threading
    <p class="Pp">Compiling with threading (-Duseithreads) completely rewrites
        the function prototypes of Perl. You better try your changes with that.
        Related to this is the difference between &quot;Perl_-less&quot; and
        &quot;Perl_-ly&quot; APIs, for example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  Perl_sv_setiv(aTHX_ ...);
  sv_setiv(...);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The first one explicitly passes in the context, which is
        needed for e.g. threaded builds. The second one does that implicitly; do
        not get them mixed. If you are not passing in a aTHX_, you will need to
        do a dTHX (or a dVAR) as the first thing in the function.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See &quot;How multiple interpreters and concurrency are
        supported&quot; in perlguts for further discussion about context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Not compiling with -DDEBUGGING
    <p class="Pp">The DEBUGGING define exposes more code to the compiler,
        therefore more ways for things to go wrong. You should try it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Introducing (non-read-only) globals
    <p class="Pp">Do not introduce any modifiable globals, truly global or file
        static. They are bad form and complicate multithreading and other forms
        of concurrency. The right way is to introduce them as new interpreter
        variables, see <i>intrpvar.h</i> (at the very end for binary
        compatibility).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Introducing read-only (const) globals is okay, as long as you
        verify with e.g. <span class="Li">&quot;nm libperl.a|egrep -v ' [TURtr]
        '&quot;</span> (if your <span class="Li">&quot;nm&quot;</span> has
        BSD-style output) that the data you added really is read-only. (If it
        is, it shouldn't show up in the output of that command.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you want to have static strings, make them constant:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  static const char etc[] = &quot;...&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you want to have arrays of constant strings, note carefully
        the right combination of <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span>s:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    static const char * const yippee[] =
        {&quot;hi&quot;, &quot;ho&quot;, &quot;silver&quot;};
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">There is a way to completely hide any modifiable globals (they
        are all moved to heap), the compilation setting
        <span class="Li">&quot;-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT_PRIVATE&quot;</span>. It is
        not normally used, but can be used for testing, read more about it in
        &quot;Background and PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT&quot; in perlguts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Not exporting your new function
    <p class="Pp">Some platforms (Win32, AIX, VMS, OS/2, to name a few) require
        any function that is part of the public API (the shared Perl library) to
        be explicitly marked as exported. See the discussion about
        <i>embed.pl</i> in perlguts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Exporting your new function
    <p class="Pp">The new shiny result of either genuine new functionality or
        your arduous refactoring is now ready and correctly exported. So what
        could possibly go wrong?</p>
    <p class="Pp">Maybe simply that your function did not need to be exported in
        the first place. Perl has a long and not so glorious history of
        exporting functions that it should not have.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the function is used only inside one source code file, make
        it static. See the discussion about <i>embed.pl</i> in perlguts.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the function is used across several files, but intended
        only for Perl's internal use (and this should be the common case), do
        not export it to the public API. See the discussion about
        <i>embed.pl</i> in perlguts.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Portability_problems"><a class="permalink" href="#Portability_problems">Portability
  problems</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The following are common causes of compilation and/or execution
    failures, not common to Perl as such. The C FAQ is good bedtime reading.
    Please test your changes with as many C compilers and platforms as possible;
    we will, anyway, and it's nice to save oneself from public
  embarrassment.</p>
<p class="Pp">If using gcc, you can add the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-std=c89&quot;</span> option which will hopefully
    catch most of these unportabilities. (However it might also catch
    incompatibilities in your system's header files.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Use the Configure
    <span class="Li">&quot;-Dgccansipedantic&quot;</span> flag to enable the gcc
    <span class="Li">&quot;-ansi</span> <span class="Li">-pedantic&quot;</span>
    flags which enforce stricter ANSI rules.</p>
<p class="Pp">If using the <span class="Li">&quot;gcc -Wall&quot;</span> note
    that not all the possible warnings (like
    <span class="Li">&quot;-Wunitialized&quot;</span>) are given unless you also
    compile with <span class="Li">&quot;-O&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that if using gcc, starting from Perl 5.9.5 the Perl core
    source code files (the ones at the top level of the source code
    distribution, but not e.g. the extensions under ext/) are automatically
    compiled with as many as possible of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-std=c89&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;-ansi&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;-pedantic&quot;</span>, and a selection of
    <span class="Li">&quot;-W&quot;</span> flags (see cflags.SH).</p>
<p class="Pp">Also study perlport carefully to avoid any bad assumptions about
    the operating system, filesystems, and so forth.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may once in a while try a &quot;make microperl&quot; to see
    whether we can still compile Perl with just the bare minimum of interfaces.
    (See README.micro.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Do not assume an operating system indicates a certain
  compiler.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Casting pointers to integers or casting integers to pointers
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    void castaway(U8* p)
    {
      IV i = p;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    void castaway(U8* p)
    {
      IV i = (IV)p;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Both are bad, and broken, and unportable. Use the
        <i>PTR2IV()</i> macro that does it right. (Likewise, there are
        <i>PTR2UV()</i>, <i>PTR2NV()</i>, <i>INT2PTR()</i>, and
        <i>NUM2PTR()</i>.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Casting between data function pointers and data pointers
    <p class="Pp">Technically speaking casting between function pointers and
        data pointers is unportable and undefined, but practically speaking it
        seems to work, but you should use the <i>FPTR2DPTR()</i> and
        <i>DPTR2FPTR()</i> macros. Sometimes you can also play games with
        unions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Assuming sizeof(int) == sizeof(long)
    <p class="Pp">There are platforms where longs are 64 bits, and platforms
        where ints are 64 bits, and while we are out to shock you, even
        platforms where shorts are 64 bits. This is all legal according to the C
        standard. (In other words, &quot;long long&quot; is not a portable way
        to specify 64 bits, and &quot;long long&quot; is not even guaranteed to
        be any wider than &quot;long&quot;.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Instead, use the definitions IV, UV, IVSIZE, I32SIZE, and so
        forth. Avoid things like I32 because they are <b>not</b> guaranteed to
        be <i>exactly</i> 32 bits, they are <i>at least</i> 32 bits, nor are
        they guaranteed to be <b>int</b> or <b>long</b>. If you really
        explicitly need 64-bit variables, use I64 and U64, but only if guarded
        by HAS_QUAD.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Assuming one can dereference any type of pointer for any type of data
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  char *p = ...;
  long pony = *p;    /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Many platforms, quite rightly so, will give you a core dump
        instead of a pony if the p happens not to be correctly aligned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Lvalue casts
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  (int)*p = ...;    /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Simply not portable. Get your lvalue to be of the right type,
        or maybe use temporary variables, or dirty tricks with unions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Assume <b>anything</b> about structs (especially the ones you don't
      control, like the ones coming from the system headers)</li>
</ul>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>That a certain field exists in a struct</li>
  <li>That no other fields exist besides the ones you know of</li>
  <li>That a field is of certain signedness, sizeof, or type</li>

<div class="Bd-indent">

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>There might be padding bytes between the fields to align the fields - the
      bytes can be anything</li>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Assuming the character set is ASCIIish
    <p class="Pp">Perl can compile and run under EBCDIC platforms. See
        perlebcdic. This is transparent for the most part, but because the
        character sets differ, you shouldn't use numeric (decimal, octal, nor
        hex) constants to refer to characters. You can safely say 'A', but not
        0x41. You can safely say '\n', but not \012. If a character doesn't have
        a trivial input form, you should add it to the list in
        <i>regen/unicode_constants.pl</i>, and have Perl create #defines for
        you, based on the current platform.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also, the range 'A' - 'Z' in ASCII is an unbroken sequence of
        26 upper case alphabetic characters. That is not true in EBCDIC. Nor for
        'a' to 'z'. But '0' - '9' is an unbroken range in both systems. Don't
        assume anything about other ranges.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Many of the comments in the existing code ignore the
        possibility of EBCDIC, and may be wrong therefore, even if the code
        works. This is actually a tribute to the successful transparent
        insertion of being able to handle EBCDIC without having to change
        pre-existing code.</p>
    <p class="Pp">UTF-8 and UTF-EBCDIC are two different encodings used to
        represent Unicode code points as sequences of bytes. Macros with the
        same names (but different definitions) in
        <span class="Li">&quot;utf8.h&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;utfebcdic.h&quot;</span> are used to allow the
        calling code to think that there is only one such encoding. This is
        almost always referred to as <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span>,
        but it means the EBCDIC version as well. Again, comments in the code may
        well be wrong even if the code itself is right. For example, the concept
        of <span class="Li">&quot;invariant</span>
        <span class="Li">characters&quot;</span> differs between ASCII and
        EBCDIC. On ASCII platforms, only characters that do not have the
        high-order bit set (i.e. whose ordinals are strict ASCII, 0 - 127) are
        invariant, and the documentation and comments in the code may assume
        that, often referring to something like, say,
        <span class="Li">&quot;hibit&quot;</span>. The situation differs and is
        not so simple on EBCDIC machines, but as long as the code itself uses
        the <span class="Li">&quot;NATIVE_IS_INVARIANT()&quot;</span> macro
        appropriately, it works, even if the comments are wrong.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Assuming the character set is just ASCII
    <p class="Pp">ASCII is a 7 bit encoding, but bytes have 8 bits in them. The
        128 extra characters have different meanings depending on the locale.
        Absent a locale, currently these extra characters are generally
        considered to be unassigned, and this has presented some problems. This
        is being changed starting in 5.12 so that these characters will be
        considered to be Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Mixing #define and #ifdef
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  #define BURGLE(x) ... \
  #ifdef BURGLE_OLD_STYLE        /* BAD */
  ... do it the old way ... \
  #else
  ... do it the new way ... \
  #endif
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You cannot portably &quot;stack&quot; cpp directives. For
        example in the above you need two separate <i>BURGLE()</i> #defines, one
        for each #ifdef branch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Adding non-comment stuff after #endif or #else
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  #ifdef SNOSH
  ...
  #else !SNOSH    /* BAD */
  ...
  #endif SNOSH    /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The #endif and #else cannot portably have anything non-comment
        after them. If you want to document what is going (which is a good idea
        especially if the branches are long), use (C) comments:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  #ifdef SNOSH
  ...
  #else /* !SNOSH */
  ...
  #endif /* SNOSH */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The gcc option
        <span class="Li">&quot;-Wendif-labels&quot;</span> warns about the bad
        variant (by default on starting from Perl 5.9.4).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Having a comma after the last element of an enum list
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  enum color {
    CERULEAN,
    CHARTREUSE,
    CINNABAR,     /* BAD */
  };
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is not portable. Leave out the last comma.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also note that whether enums are implicitly morphable to ints
        varies between compilers, you might need to (int).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Using //-comments
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  // This function bamfoodles the zorklator.   /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">That is C99 or C++. Perl is C89. Using the //-comments is
        silently allowed by many C compilers but cranking up the ANSI C89
        strictness (which we like to do) causes the compilation to fail.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Mixing declarations and code
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  void zorklator()
  {
    int n = 3;
    set_zorkmids(n);    /* BAD */
    int q = 4;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">That is C99 or C++. Some C compilers allow that, but you
        shouldn't.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The gcc option
        <span class="Li">&quot;-Wdeclaration-after-statements&quot;</span> scans
        for such problems (by default on starting from Perl 5.9.4).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Introducing variables inside <i>for()</i>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  for(int i = ...; ...; ...) {    /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">That is C99 or C++. While it would indeed be awfully nice to
        have that also in C89, to limit the scope of the loop variable, alas, we
        cannot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Mixing signed char pointers with unsigned char pointers
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  int foo(char *s) { ... }
  ...
  unsigned char *t = ...; /* Or U8* t = ... */
  foo(t);   /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">While this is legal practice, it is certainly dubious, and
        downright fatal in at least one platform: for example VMS cc considers
        this a fatal error. One cause for people often making this mistake is
        that a &quot;naked char&quot; and therefore dereferencing a &quot;naked
        char pointer&quot; have an undefined signedness: it depends on the
        compiler and the flags of the compiler and the underlying platform
        whether the result is signed or unsigned. For this very same reason
        using a 'char' as an array index is bad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Macros that have string constants and their arguments as substrings of the
      string constants
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  #define FOO(n) printf(&quot;number = %d\n&quot;, n)    /* BAD */
  FOO(10);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Pre-ANSI semantics for that was equivalent to</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  printf(&quot;10umber = %d\10&quot;);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">which is probably not what you were expecting. Unfortunately
        at least one reasonably common and modern C compiler does &quot;real
        backward compatibility&quot; here, in AIX that is what still happens
        even though the rest of the AIX compiler is very happily C89.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Using printf formats for non-basic C types
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   IV i = ...;
   printf(&quot;i = %d\n&quot;, i);    /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">While this might by accident work in some platform (where IV
        happens to be an <span class="Li">&quot;int&quot;</span>), in general it
        cannot. IV might be something larger. Even worse the situation is with
        more specific types (defined by Perl's configuration step in
        <i>config.h</i>):</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   Uid_t who = ...;
   printf(&quot;who = %d\n&quot;, who);    /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The problem here is that Uid_t might be not only not
        <span class="Li">&quot;int&quot;</span>-wide but it might also be
        unsigned, in which case large uids would be printed as negative
      values.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There is no simple solution to this because of
        <i>printf()</i>'s limited intelligence, but for many types the right
        format is available as with either 'f' or '_f' suffix, for example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   IVdf /* IV in decimal */
   UVxf /* UV is hexadecimal */

   printf(&quot;i = %&quot;IVdf&quot;\n&quot;, i); /* The IVdf is a string constant. */

   Uid_t_f /* Uid_t in decimal */

   printf(&quot;who = %&quot;Uid_t_f&quot;\n&quot;, who);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Or you can try casting to a &quot;wide enough&quot; type:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   printf(&quot;i = %&quot;IVdf&quot;\n&quot;, (IV)something_very_small_and_signed);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Also remember that the <span class="Li">%p</span> format
        really does require a void pointer:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   U8* p = ...;
   printf(&quot;p = %p\n&quot;, (void*)p);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The gcc option <span class="Li">&quot;-Wformat&quot;</span>
        scans for such problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Blindly using variadic macros
    <p class="Pp">gcc has had them for a while with its own syntax, and C99
        brought them with a standardized syntax. Don't use the former, and use
        the latter only if the HAS_C99_VARIADIC_MACROS is defined.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Blindly passing va_list
    <p class="Pp">Not all platforms support passing va_list to further varargs
        (stdarg) functions. The right thing to do is to copy the va_list using
        the <i>Perl_va_copy()</i> if the NEED_VA_COPY is defined.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Using gcc statement expressions
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   val = ({...;...;...});    /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">While a nice extension, it's not portable. The Perl code does
        admittedly use them if available to gain some extra speed (essentially
        as a funky form of inlining), but you shouldn't.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Binding together several statements in a macro
    <p class="Pp">Use the macros STMT_START and STMT_END.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   STMT_START {
      ...
   } STMT_END

    <span class="Li">&quot;-ansi&quot;</span> and

<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;-Wall&quot;</span> is by default
  on.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;-ansi&quot;</span> (and its sidekick,
    <span class="Li">&quot;-pedantic&quot;</span>) would be nice to be on
    always, but unfortunately they are not safe on all platforms, they can for
    example cause fatal conflicts with the system headers (Solaris being a prime
    example). If Configure <span class="Li">&quot;-Dgccansipedantic&quot;</span>

    one switch (it would be impossible to deploy in practice because it would
    complain a lot) but it does contain some warnings that would be beneficial
    to have available on their own, such as the warning about string constants

    Purify, Third Degree, and valgrind. Under valgrind it takes more than six
    hours, even on a snappy computer. The said test must be doing something that

    overruns, wild pointers, memory leaks and other such badness. Perl must be
    compiled in a specific way for optimal testing with Purify. Purify is
    available under Windows NT, Solaris, HP-UX, SGI, and Siemens Unix.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Purify on Unix</i></p>
<p class="Pp">On Unix, Purify creates a new Perl binary. To get the most benefit
    out of Purify, you should create the perl to Purify using:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    sh Configure -Accflags=-DPURIFY -Doptimize='-g' \
     -Uusemymalloc -Dusemultiplicity
</pre>
<p class="Pp">where these arguments mean:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>-Accflags=-DPURIFY
    <p class="Pp">Disables Perl's arena memory allocation functions, as well as
        forcing use of memory allocation functions derived from the system
        malloc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>-Doptimize='-g'
    <p class="Pp">Adds debugging information so that you see the exact source
        statements where the problem occurs. Without this flag, all you will see
        is the source filename of where the error occurred.</p>
  </li>
  <li>-Uusemymalloc
    <p class="Pp">Disable Perl's malloc so that Purify can more closely monitor
        allocations and leaks. Using Perl's malloc will make Purify report most
        leaks in the &quot;potential&quot; leaks category.</p>
  </li>
  <li>-Dusemultiplicity
    <p class="Pp">Enabling the multiplicity option allows perl to clean up
        thoroughly when the interpreter shuts down, which reduces the number of
        bogus leak reports from Purify.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Once you've compiled a perl suitable for Purify'ing, then you can
    just:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    make pureperl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which creates a binary named 'pureperl' that has been Purify'ed.
    This binary is used in place of the standard 'perl' binary when you want to
    debug Perl memory problems.</p>
<p class="Pp">As an example, to show any memory leaks produced during the
    standard Perl testset you would create and run the Purify'ed perl as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    make pureperl
    cd t
    ../pureperl -I../lib harness
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which would run Perl on test.pl and report any memory
  problems.</p>
<p class="Pp">Purify outputs messages in &quot;Viewer&quot; windows by default.
    If you don't have a windowing environment or if you simply want the Purify
    output to unobtrusively go to a log file instead of to the interactive
    window, use these following options to output to the log file
    &quot;perl.log&quot;:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    setenv PURIFYOPTIONS &quot;-chain-length=25 -windows=no \
     -log-file=perl.log -append-logfile=yes&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you plan to use the &quot;Viewer&quot; windows, then you only
    need this option:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    setenv PURIFYOPTIONS &quot;-chain-length=25&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In Bourne-type shells:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    PURIFYOPTIONS=&quot;...&quot;
    export PURIFYOPTIONS
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or if you have the &quot;env&quot; utility:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    env PURIFYOPTIONS=&quot;...&quot; ../pureperl ...
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Purify on NT</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Purify on Windows NT instruments the Perl binary 'perl.exe' on the
    fly.
  <br/>
   There are several options in the makefile you should change to get the most
    use out of Purify:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>DEFINES
    <p class="Pp">You should add -DPURIFY to the DEFINES line so the DEFINES
        line looks something like:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   DEFINES = -DWIN32 -D_CONSOLE -DNO_STRICT $(CRYPT_FLAG) -DPURIFY=1
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">to disable Perl's arena memory allocation functions, as well
        as to force use of memory allocation functions derived from the system
        malloc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>USE_MULTI = define
    <p class="Pp">Enabling the multiplicity option allows perl to clean up
        thoroughly when the interpreter shuts down, which reduces the number of
        bogus leak reports from Purify.</p>
  </li>
  <li>#PERL_MALLOC = define
    <p class="Pp">Disable Perl's malloc so that Purify can more closely monitor
        allocations and leaks. Using Perl's malloc will make Purify report most
        leaks in the &quot;potential&quot; leaks category.</p>
  </li>
  <li>CFG = Debug
    <p class="Pp">Adds debugging information so that you see the exact source
        statements where the problem occurs. Without this flag, all you will see
        is the source filename of where the error occurred.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">As an example, to show any memory leaks produced during the
    standard Perl testset you would create and run Purify as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    cd win32
    make
    cd ../t
    purify ../perl -I../lib harness
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which would instrument Perl in memory, run Perl on test.pl, then
    finally report any memory problems.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="valgrind"><a class="permalink" href="#valgrind">valgrind</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The valgrind tool can be used to find out both memory leaks and
    illegal heap memory accesses. As of version 3.3.0, Valgrind only supports
    Linux on x86, x86-64 and PowerPC and Darwin (OS X) on x86 and x86-64). The
    special &quot;test.valgrind&quot; target can be used to run the tests under
    valgrind. Found errors and memory leaks are logged in files named
    <i>testfile.valgrind</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Valgrind also provides a cachegrind tool, invoked on perl as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    VG_OPTS=--tool=cachegrind make test.valgrind
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As system libraries (most notably glibc) are also triggering
    errors, valgrind allows to suppress such errors using suppression files. The
    default suppression file that comes with valgrind already catches a lot of
    them. Some additional suppressions are defined in <i>t/perl.supp</i>.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="AddressSanitizer"><a class="permalink" href="#AddressSanitizer">AddressSanitizer</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">AddressSanitizer is a clang extension, included in clang since
    v3.1. It checks illegal heap pointers, global pointers, stack pointers and
    use after free errors, and is fast enough that you can easily compile your
    debugging or optimized perl with it. It does not check memory leaks though.
    AddressSanitizer is available for linux, Mac OS X and soon on Windows.</p>
<p class="Pp">To build perl with AddressSanitizer, your Configure invocation
    should look like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    sh Configure -des -Dcc=clang \
       -Accflags=-faddress-sanitizer -Aldflags=-faddress-sanitizer \
       -Alddlflags=-shared\ -faddress-sanitizer

<p class="Pp">where these arguments mean:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>-Dcc=clang
    <p class="Pp">This should be replaced by the full path to your clang
        executable if it is not in your path.</p>

  <li>-Alddlflags=-shared\ -faddress-sanitizer
    <p class="Pp">Link dynamic extensions with AddressSanitizer. You must
        manually specify <span class="Li">&quot;-shared&quot;</span> because
        using <span class="Li">&quot;-Alddlflags=-shared&quot;</span> will
        prevent Configure from setting a default value for
        <span class="Li">&quot;lddlflags&quot;</span>, which usually contains

<h1 class="Sh" id="PROFILING"><a class="permalink" href="#PROFILING">PROFILING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Depending on your platform there are various ways of profiling
    Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are two commonly used techniques of profiling executables:
    <i>statistical time-sampling</i> and <i>basic-block counting</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first method takes periodically samples of the CPU program
    counter, and since the program counter can be correlated with the code
    generated for functions, we get a statistical view of in which functions the
    program is spending its time. The caveats are that very small/fast functions
    have lower probability of showing up in the profile, and that periodically
    interrupting the program (this is usually done rather frequently, in the
    scale of milliseconds) imposes an additional overhead that may skew the
    results. The first problem can be alleviated by running the code for longer
    (in general this is a good idea for profiling), the second problem is
    usually kept in guard by the profiling tools themselves.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second method divides up the generated code into <i>basic
    blocks</i>. Basic blocks are sections of code that are entered only in the
    beginning and exited only at the end. For example, a conditional jump starts
    a basic block. Basic block profiling usually works by <i>instrumenting</i>
    the code by adding <i>enter basic block #nnnn</i> book-keeping code to the
    generated code. During the execution of the code the basic block counters
    are then updated appropriately. The caveat is that the added extra code can
    skew the results: again, the profiling tools usually try to factor their own
    effects out of the results.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Gprof_Profiling"><a class="permalink" href="#Gprof_Profiling">Gprof
  Profiling</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">gprof is a profiling tool available in many Unix platforms, it
    uses <i>statistical time-sampling</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can build a profiled version of perl called
    &quot;perl.gprof&quot; by invoking the make target &quot;perl.gprof&quot;
    (What is required is that Perl must be compiled using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-pg&quot;</span> flag, you may need to re-Configure).
    Running the profiled version of Perl will create an output file called
    <i>gmon.out</i> is created which contains the profiling data collected
    during the execution.</p>
<p class="Pp">The gprof tool can then display the collected data in various
    ways. Usually gprof understands the following options:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>-a
    <p class="Pp">Suppress statically defined functions from the profile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>-b
    <p class="Pp">Suppress the verbose descriptions in the profile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>-e routine
    <p class="Pp">Exclude the given routine and its descendants from the
        profile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>-f routine
    <p class="Pp">Display only the given routine and its descendants in the
        profile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>-s
    <p class="Pp">Generate a summary file called <i>gmon.sum</i> which then may
        be given to subsequent gprof runs to accumulate data over several
      runs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>-z
    <p class="Pp">Display routines that have zero usage.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">For more detailed explanation of the available commands and output
    formats, see your own local documentation of gprof.</p>

<h2 class="Ss">GCC gcov Profiling</h2>
<p class="Pp">Starting from GCC 3.0 <i>basic block profiling</i> is officially
    available for the GNU CC.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can build a profiled version of perl called <i>perl.gcov</i>
    by invoking the make target &quot;perl.gcov&quot; (what is required that
    Perl must be compiled using gcc with the flags
    <span class="Li">&quot;-fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage&quot;</span>, you may
    need to re-Configure).</p>
<p class="Pp">Running the profiled version of Perl will cause profile output to
    be generated. For each source file an accompanying &quot;.da&quot; file will
    be created.</p>
<p class="Pp">To display the results you use the &quot;gcov&quot; utility (which
    should be installed if you have gcc 3.0 or newer installed). <i>gcov</i> is
    run on source code files, like this</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    gcov sv.c
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which will cause <i>sv.c.gcov</i> to be created. The <i>.gcov</i>
    files contain the source code annotated with relative frequencies of
    execution indicated by &quot;#&quot; markers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Useful options of <i>gcov</i> include
    <span class="Li">&quot;-b&quot;</span> which will summarise the basic block,
    branch, and function call coverage, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;-c&quot;</span> which instead of relative frequencies

<h2 class="Ss">PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL</h2>
<p class="Pp">If you want to run any of the tests yourself manually using e.g.
    valgrind, or the pureperl or perl.third executables, please note that by
    default perl <b>does not</b> explicitly cleanup all the memory it has
    allocated (such as global memory arenas) but instead lets the <i>exit()</i>
    of the whole program &quot;take care&quot; of such allocations, also known
    as &quot;global destruction of objects&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is a way to tell perl to do complete cleanup: set the
    environment variable PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL to a non-zero value. The t/TEST
    wrapper does set this to 2, and this is what you need to do too, if you
    don't want to see the &quot;global leaks&quot;: For example, for
    &quot;third-degreed&quot; Perl:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
        env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 ./perl.third -Ilib t/foo/bar.t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(Note: the mod_perl apache module uses also this environment
    variable for its own purposes and extended its semantics. Refer to the
    mod_perl documentation for more information. Also, spawned threads do the
    equivalent of setting this variable to the value 1.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If, at the end of a run you get the message <i>N scalars
    leaked</i>, you can recompile with
    <span class="Li">&quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;</span>, which will
    cause the addresses of all those leaked SVs to be dumped along with details
    as to where each SV was originally allocated. This information is also
    displayed by Devel::Peek. Note that the extra details recorded with each SV
    increases memory usage, so it shouldn't be used in production environments.
    It also converts <span class="Li">&quot;new_SV()&quot;</span> from a macro
    into a real function, so you can use your favourite debugger to discover
    where those pesky SVs were allocated.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you see that you're leaking memory at runtime, but neither
    valgrind nor <span class="Li">&quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;</span>
    will find anything, you're probably leaking SVs that are still reachable and
    will be properly cleaned up during destruction of the interpreter. In such
    cases, using the <span class="Li">&quot;-Dm&quot;</span> switch can point
    you to the source of the leak. If the executable was built with
    <span class="Li">&quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;-Dm&quot;</span> will output SV allocations in
    addition to memory allocations. Each SV allocation has a distinct serial
    number that will be written on creation and destruction of the SV. So if
    you're executing the leaking code in a loop, you need to look for SVs that
    are created, but never destroyed between each cycle. If such an SV is found,
    set a conditional breakpoint within
    <span class="Li">&quot;new_SV()&quot;</span> and make it break only when
    <span class="Li">&quot;PL_sv_serial&quot;</span> is equal to the serial
    number of the leaking SV. Then you will catch the interpreter in exactly the
    state where the leaking SV is allocated, which is sufficient in many cases
    to find the source of the leak.</p>
<p class="Pp">As <span class="Li">&quot;-Dm&quot;</span> is using the PerlIO
    layer for output, it will by itself allocate quite a bunch of SVs, which are
    hidden to avoid recursion. You can bypass the PerlIO layer if you use the SV
    logging provided by <span class="Li">&quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG&quot;</span>
    instead.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PERL_MEM_LOG</h2>
<p class="Pp">If compiled with
    <span class="Li">&quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG&quot;</span>, both memory and SV
    allocations go through logging functions, which is handy for breakpoint
    setting.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless <span class="Li">&quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG_NOIMPL&quot;</span>
    is also compiled, the logging functions read
    <span class="Li">$ENV</span>{PERL_MEM_LOG} to determine whether to log the
    event, and if so how:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /m/           Log all memory ops
    $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /s/           Log all SV ops
    $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /t/           include timestamp in Log
    $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /^(\d+)/      write to FD given (default is 2)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Memory logging is somewhat similar to
    <span class="Li">&quot;-Dm&quot;</span> but is independent of
    <span class="Li">&quot;-DDEBUGGING&quot;</span>, and at a higher level; all
    uses of <i>Newx()</i>, <i>Renew()</i>, and <i>Safefree()</i> are logged with
    the caller's source code file and line number (and C function name, if
    supported by the C compiler). In contrast,
    <span class="Li">&quot;-Dm&quot;</span> is directly at the point of
    <span class="Li">&quot;malloc()&quot;</span>. SV logging is similar.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since the logging doesn't use PerlIO, all SV allocations are
    logged and no extra SV allocations are introduced by enabling the logging.
    If compiled with
    <span class="Li">&quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;</span>, the serial
    number for each SV allocation is also logged.</p>

<h2 class="Ss">DDD over gdb</h2>
<p class="Pp">Those debugging perl with the DDD frontend over gdb may find the
    following useful:</p>
<p class="Pp">You can extend the data conversion shortcuts menu, so for example
    you can display an SV's IV value with one click, without doing any typing.
    To do that simply edit ~/.ddd/init file and add after:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  ! Display shortcuts.
  Ddd*gdbDisplayShortcuts: \
  /t ()   // Convert to Bin\n\
  /d ()   // Convert to Dec\n\
  /x ()   // Convert to Hex\n\

  ((XPVIV*) (())-&gt;sv_any )-&gt;xiv_iv // 2ivx
</pre>
<p class="Pp">so now you can do ivx and pvx lookups or you can plug there the
    sv_peek &quot;conversion&quot;:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  Perl_sv_peek(my_perl, (SV*)()) // sv_peek

    that allocates op memory via <span class="Li">&quot;mmap&quot;</span>, and
