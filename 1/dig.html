<p class="Pp"><b>dig</b> (domain information groper) is a flexible tool for
    interrogating DNS name servers. It performs DNS lookups and displays the
    answers that are returned from the name server(s) that were queried. Most
    DNS administrators use <b>dig</b> to troubleshoot DNS problems because of
    its flexibility, ease of use and clarity of output. Other lookup tools tend
    to have less functionality than <b>dig</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Although <b>dig</b> is normally used with command-line arguments,
    it also has a batch mode of operation for reading lookup requests from a
    file. A brief summary of its command-line arguments and options is printed
    when the <b>-h</b> option is given. Unlike earlier versions, the BIND 9
    implementation of <b>dig</b> allows multiple lookups to be issued from the
    command line.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless it is told to query a specific name server, <b>dig</b> will
    try each of the servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf. If no usable server
    addresses are found, <b>dig</b> will send the query to the local host.</p>
<p class="Pp">When no command line arguments or options are given, <b>dig</b>
    will perform an NS query for &quot;.&quot; (the root).</p>
<p class="Pp">It is possible to set per-user defaults for <b>dig</b> via
    ${HOME}/.digrc. This file is read and any options in it are applied before
    the command line arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">The IN and CH class names overlap with the IN and CH top level
    domain names. Either use the <b>-t</b> and <b>-c</b> options to specify the
    type and class, use the <b>-q</b> the specify the domain name, or use
    &quot;IN.&quot; and &quot;CH.&quot; when looking up these top level
  domains.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SIMPLE_USAGE"><a class="permalink" href="#SIMPLE_USAGE">SIMPLE
  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A typical invocation of <b>dig</b> looks like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
 dig @server name type 
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">where:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>server</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">is the name or IP address of the name server to query.
  This can be an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in
  colon-delimited notation. When the supplied <i>server</i> argument is a
  hostname, <b>dig</b> resolves that name before querying that name server.
<p class="Pp">If no <i>server</i> argument is provided, <b>dig</b> consults
    /etc/resolv.conf; if an address is found there, it queries the name server
    at that address. If either of the <b>-4</b> or <b>-6</b> options are in use,
    then only addresses for the corresponding transport will be tried. If no
    usable addresses are found, <b>dig</b> will send the query to the local
    host. The reply from the name server that responds is displayed.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>name</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">is the name of the resource record that is to be looked
  up.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>type</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">indicates what type of query is required &#x2014; ANY, A,
  MX, SIG, etc. <i>type</i> can be any valid query type. If no <i>type</i>
  argument is supplied, <b>dig</b> will perform a lookup for an A record.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">-4</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use IPv4 only.</div>
<p class="Pp">-6</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use IPv6 only.</div>
<p class="Pp">-b <i>address</i><i>[#port]</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the source IP address of the query. The
  <i>address</i> must be a valid address on one of the host's network
  interfaces, or &quot;0.0.0.0&quot; or &quot;::&quot;. An optional port may be
  specified by appending &quot;#&lt;port&gt;&quot;</div>
<p class="Pp">-c <i>class</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the query class. The default <i>class</i> is IN;
  other classes are HS for Hesiod records or CH for Chaosnet records.</div>
<p class="Pp">-f <i>file</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Batch mode: <b>dig</b> reads a list of lookup requests to
  process from the given <i>file</i>. Each line in the file should be organized
  in the same way they would be presented as queries to <b>dig</b> using the
  command-line interface.</div>
<p class="Pp">-i</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do reverse IPv6 lookups using the obsolete RFC1886
  IP6.INT domain, which is no longer in use. Obsolete bit string label queries
  (RFC2874) are not attempted.</div>
<p class="Pp">-k <i>keyfile</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sign queries using TSIG using a key read from the given
  file. Key files can be generated using <b>tsig-keygen</b>(8). When using TSIG
  authentication with <b>dig</b>, the name server that is queried needs to know
  the key and algorithm that is being used. In BIND, this is done by providing
  appropriate <b>key</b> and <b>server</b> statements in named.conf.</div>
<p class="Pp">-m</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable memory usage debugging.</div>
<p class="Pp">-p <i>port</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Send the query to a non-standard port on the server,
  instead of the defaut port 53. This option would be used to test a name server
  that has been configured to listen for queries on a non-standard port
  number.</div>
<p class="Pp">-q <i>name</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The domain name to query. This is useful to distinguish
  the <i>name</i> from other arguments.</div>
<p class="Pp">-t <i>type</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The resource record type to query. It can be any valid
  query type which is supported in BIND 9. The default query type is
  &quot;A&quot;, unless the <b>-x</b> option is supplied to indicate a reverse
  lookup. A zone transfer can be requested by specifying a type of AXFR. When an
  incremental zone transfer (IXFR) is required, set the <i>type</i> to ixfr=N.
  The incremental zone transfer will contain the changes made to the zone since
  the serial number in the zone's SOA record was <i>N</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-v</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print the version number and exit.</div>
<p class="Pp">-x <i>addr</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Simplified reverse lookups, for mapping addresses to
  names. The <i>addr</i> is an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation, or a
  colon-delimited IPv6 address. When the <b>-x</b> is used, there is no need to
  provide the <i>name</i>, <i>class</i> and <i>type</i> arguments. <b>dig</b>
  automatically performs a lookup for a name like 94.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa and
  sets the query type and class to PTR and IN respectively. IPv6 addresses are
  looked up using nibble format under the IP6.ARPA domain (but see also the
  <b>-i</b> option).</div>
<p class="Pp">-y <i>[hmac:]</i><i>keyname:secret</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sign queries using TSIG with the given authentication
  key. <i>keyname</i> is the name of the key, and <i>secret</i> is the base64
  encoded shared secret. <i>hmac</i> is the name of the key algorithm; valid
  choices are hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, hmac-sha224, hmac-sha256, hmac-sha384, or
  hmac-sha512. If <i>hmac</i> is not specified, the default is hmac-md5 or if
  MD5 was disabled hmac-sha256.
<p class="Pp">NOTE: You should use the <b>-k</b> option and avoid the <b>-y</b>
    option, because with <b>-y</b> the shared secret is supplied as a command
    line argument in clear text. This may be visible in the output from
    <b>ps</b>(1) or in a history file maintained by the user's shell.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="macOS_NOTICE"><a class="permalink" href="#macOS_NOTICE">macOS
  NOTICE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>dig</b> command does not use the host name and address
    resolution or the DNS query routing mechanisms used by other processes
    running on macOS. The results of name or address queries printed by
    <b>dig</b> may differ from those found by other processes that use the macOS
    native name and address resolution mechanisms. The results of DNS queries
    may also differ from queries that use the macOS DNS routing library.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="QUERY_OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#QUERY_OPTIONS">QUERY
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>dig</b> provides a number of query options which affect the way
    in which lookups are made and the results displayed. Some of these set or
    reset flag bits in the query header, some determine which sections of the
    answer get printed, and others determine the timeout and retry
  strategies.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each query option is identified by a keyword preceded by a plus
    sign (+). Some keywords set or reset an option. These may be preceded by the
    string no to negate the meaning of that keyword. Other keywords assign
    values to options like the timeout interval. They have the form
    <b>+keyword=value</b>. Keywords may be abbreviated, provided the
    abbreviation is unambiguous; for example, +cd is equivalent to +cdflag. The
    query options are:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]aaflag</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A synonym for <i>+[no]aaonly</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]aaonly</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sets the &quot;aa&quot; flag in the query.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]additional</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Display [do not display] the additional section of a
  reply. The default is to display it.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]adflag</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set [do not set] the AD (authentic data) bit in the
  query. This requests the server to return whether all of the answer and
  authority sections have all been validated as secure according to the security
  policy of the server. AD=1 indicates that all records have been validated as
  secure and the answer is not from a OPT-OUT range. AD=0 indicate that some
  part of the answer was insecure or not validated. This bit is set by
  default.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]all</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set or clear all display flags.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]answer</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Display [do not display] the answer section of a reply.
  The default is to display it.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]authority</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Display [do not display] the authority section of a
  reply. The default is to display it.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]besteffort</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Attempt to display the contents of messages which are
  malformed. The default is to not display malformed answers.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+bufsize=B</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the UDP message buffer size advertised using EDNS0 to
  <i>B</i> bytes. The maximum and minimum sizes of this buffer are 65535 and 0
  respectively. Values outside this range are rounded up or down appropriately.
  Values other than zero will cause a EDNS query to be sent.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]cdflag</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set [do not set] the CD (checking disabled) bit in the
  query. This requests the server to not perform DNSSEC validation of
  responses.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]class</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Display [do not display] the CLASS when printing the
  record.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]cmd</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Toggles the printing of the initial comment in the output
  identifying the version of <b>dig</b> and the query options that have been
  applied. This comment is printed by default.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]comments</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Toggle the display of comment lines in the output. The
  default is to print comments.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]cookie</b><b>[=####]</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Send an COOKIE EDNS option, containing an optional
  <i>value</i>. Replaying a COOKIE from a previous response will allow the
  server to identify a previous client. The default is <b>+nocookie</b>.
<p class="Pp"><b>+cookie</b> is automatically set when +trace is in use, to
    better emulate the default queries from a nameserver.</p>
<p class="Pp">This option was formerly called <b>+[no]sit</b> (Server Identity
    Token). In BIND 9.10.0 through BIND 9.10.2, it sent the experimental option
    code 65001. This was changed to option code 10 in BIND 9.10.3 when the DNS
    COOKIE option was allocated.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>+[no]sit</b> is now deprecated, but has been retained as a
    synonym for <b>+[no]cookie</b> for backward compatibility within the BIND
    9.10 branch.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]crypto</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Toggle the display of cryptographic fields in DNSSEC
  records. The contents of these field are unnecessary to debug most DNSSEC
  validation failures and removing them makes it easier to see the common
  failures. The default is to display the fields. When omitted they are replaced
  by the string &quot;[omitted]&quot; or in the DNSKEY case the key id is
  displayed as the replacement, e.g. &quot;[ key id = value ]&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]defname</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deprecated, treated as a synonym for
  <i>+[no]search</i></div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]dnssec</b></p>

  bit (DO) in the OPT record in the additional section of the query.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+domain=somename</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the search list to contain the single domain
  <i>somename</i>, as if specified in a <b>domain</b> directive in
  /etc/resolv.conf, and enable search list processing as if the <i>+search</i>
  option were given.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]edns[=#]</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the EDNS version to query with. Valid values are
  0 to 255. Setting the EDNS version will cause a EDNS query to be sent.
  <b>+noedns</b> clears the remembered EDNS version. EDNS is set to 0 by
  default.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]ednsflags[=#]</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the must-be-zero EDNS flags bits (Z bits) to the
  specified value. Decimal, hex and octal encodings are accepted. Setting a
  named flag (e.g. DO) will silently be ignored. By default, no Z bits are
  set.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]ednsnegotiation</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable / disable EDNS version negotiation. By default
  EDNS version negotiation is enabled.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]ednsopt[=code[:value]]</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify EDNS option with code point <b>code</b> and
  optionally payload of <b>value</b> as a hexadecimal string. <b>code</b> can be
  either an EDNS option name (for example, NSID or ECS), or an arbitrary numeric
  value. <b>+noednsopt</b> clears the EDNS options to be sent.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]expire</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Send an EDNS Expire option.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]fail</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not try the next server if you receive a SERVFAIL. The

<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]identify</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show [or do not show] the IP address and port number that
  supplied the answer when the <i>+short</i> option is enabled. If short form
  answers are requested, the default is not to show the source address and port
  number of the server that provided the answer.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]idnout</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Convert [do not convert] puny code on output. This
  requires IDN SUPPORT to have been enabled at compile time. The default is to
  convert output.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]ignore</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore truncation in UDP responses instead of retrying
  with TCP. By default, TCP retries are performed.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]keepopen</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Keep the TCP socket open between queries and reuse it
  rather than creating a new TCP socket for each lookup. The default is
  <b>+nokeepopen</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]multiline</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print records like the SOA records in a verbose

  output.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+ndots=D</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the number of dots that have to appear in <i>name</i>
  to <i>D</i> for it to be considered absolute. The default value is that
  defined using the ndots statement in /etc/resolv.conf, or 1 if no ndots
  statement is present. Names with fewer dots are interpreted as relative names

  <b>domain</b> directive in /etc/resolv.conf if <b>+search</b> is set.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]nsid</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Include an EDNS name server ID request when sending a
  query.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]nssearch</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When this option is set, <b>dig</b> attempts to find the

  and display the SOA record that each name server has for the zone.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]onesoa</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print only one (starting) SOA record when performing an
  AXFR. The default is to print both the starting and ending SOA records.</div>

<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]recurse</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Toggle the setting of the RD (recursion desired) bit in
  the query. This bit is set by default, which means <b>dig</b> normally sends
  recursive queries. Recursion is automatically disabled when the
  <i>+nssearch</i> or <i>+trace</i> query options are used.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+retry=T</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sets the number of times to retry UDP queries to server

<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]search</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use [do not use] the search list defined by the
  searchlist or domain directive in resolv.conf (if any). The search list is not
  used by default.
<p class="Pp">'ndots' from resolv.conf (default 1) which may be overridden by

<p class="Pp"><b>+split=W</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Split long hex- or base64-formatted fields in resource
  records into chunks of <i>W</i> characters (where <i>W</i> is rounded up to
  the nearest multiple of 4). <i>+nosplit</i> or <i>+split=0</i> causes fields

<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]subnet=addr[/prefix-length]</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Send (don't send) an EDNS Client Subnet option with the
  specified IP address or network prefix.
<p class="Pp"><b>dig +subnet=0.0.0.0/0</b>, or simply <b>dig +subnet=0</b> for
    short, sends an EDNS CLIENT-SUBNET option with an empty address and a source
    prefix-length of zero, which signals a resolver that the client's address
    information must <i>not</i> be used when resolving this query.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]tcp</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use [do not use] TCP when querying name servers. The

  case the default is TCP. AXFR queries always use TCP.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+time=T</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sets the timeout for a query to <i>T</i> seconds. The

  result in a query timeout of 1 second being applied.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]topdown</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When chasing DNSSEC signature chains perform a top-down

  deprecated. Use <b>delv</b> instead.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]trace</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Toggle tracing of the delegation path from the root name
  servers for the name being looked up. Tracing is disabled by default. When
  tracing is enabled, <b>dig</b> makes iterative queries to resolve the name
  being looked up. It will follow referrals from the root servers, showing the
  answer from each server that was used to resolve the lookup.
<p class="Pp">If @server is also specified, it affects only the initial query
    for the root zone name servers.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>+dnssec</b> is also set when +trace is set to better emulate
    the default queries from a nameserver.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+tries=T</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sets the number of times to try UDP queries to server to
  <i>T</i> instead of the default, 3. If <i>T</i> is less than or equal to zero,

<h1 class="Sh" id="MULTIPLE_QUERIES"><a class="permalink" href="#MULTIPLE_QUERIES">MULTIPLE
  QUERIES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The BIND 9 implementation of <b>dig </b> supports specifying
    multiple queries on the command line (in addition to supporting the
    <b>-f</b> batch file option). Each of those queries can be supplied with its
    own set of flags, options and query options.</p>
<p class="Pp">In this case, each <i>query</i> argument represent an individual
    query in the command-line syntax described above. Each consists of any of
    the standard options and flags, the name to be looked up, an optional query
    type and class and any query options that should be applied to that
  query.</p>
<p class="Pp">A global set of query options, which should be applied to all
    queries, can also be supplied. These global query options must precede the
    first tuple of name, class, type, options, flags, and query options supplied
    on the command line. Any global query options (except the <b>+[no]cmd</b>
    option) can be overridden by a query-specific set of query options. For
    example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
dig +qr www.isc.org any -x 127.0.0.1 isc.org ns +noqr
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">shows how <b>dig</b> could be used from the command line to make
    three lookups: an ANY query for www.isc.org, a reverse lookup of 127.0.0.1
    and a query for the NS records of isc.org. A global query option of
    <i>+qr</i> is applied, so that <b>dig</b> shows the initial query it made
    for each lookup. The final query has a local query option of <i>+noqr</i>
    which means that <b>dig</b> will not print the initial query when it looks
    up the NS records for isc.org.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="IDN_SUPPORT"><a class="permalink" href="#IDN_SUPPORT">IDN
  SUPPORT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If <b>dig</b> has been built with IDN (internationalized domain
    name) support, it can accept and display non-ASCII domain names. <b>dig</b>
    appropriately converts character encoding of domain name before sending a
    request to DNS server or displaying a reply from the server. If you'd like
    to turn off the IDN support for some reason, defines the <b>IDN_DISABLE</b>
    environment variable. The IDN support is disabled if the variable is set
    when <b>dig</b> runs.</p>
