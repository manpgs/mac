<p class="Pp"><i>Less</i> is a program similar to <i>more</i>(1), but which
    allows backward movement in the file as well as forward movement. Also,
    <i>less</i> does not have to read the entire input file before starting, so
    with large input files it starts up faster than text editors like
    <i>vi</i>(1). <i>Less</i> uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it
    can run on a variety of terminals. There is even limited support for
    hardcopy terminals. (On a hardcopy terminal, lines which should be printed
    at the top of the screen are prefixed with a caret.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Commands are based on both <i>more</i> and <i>vi</i>. Commands may
    be preceded by a decimal number, called N in the descriptions below. The
    number is used by some commands, as indicated.</p>

  <dd>Scroll horizontally right N characters, default half the screen width (see
      the -# option). If a number N is specified, it becomes the default for
      future RIGHTARROW and LEFTARROW commands. While the text is scrolled, it
      acts as though the -S option (chop lines) were in effect.</dd>

    viewed.</dd>
  <dt id="F"><a class="permalink" href="#F">F</a></dt>
  <dd>Scroll forward, and keep trying to read when the end of file is reached.
      Normally this command would be used when already at the end of the file.
      It is a way to monitor the tail of a file which is growing while it is
      being viewed. (The behavior is similar to the &quot;tail -f&quot;
      command.) To stop waiting for more data, enter the interrupt character
      (usually ^C). On some systems you can also use ^X.</dd>
  <dt id="ESC-F"><a class="permalink" href="#ESC-F">ESC-F</a></dt>

  <dd>If a left curly bracket appears in the top line displayed on the screen,

      right curly bracket is positioned on the bottom line of the screen. If
      there is more than one left curly bracket on the top line, a number N may
      be used to specify the N-th bracket on the line.</dd>

  <dt id="ESC-_F"><a class="permalink" href="#ESC-_F">ESC-^F</a></dt>
  <dd>Followed by two characters, acts like {, but uses the two characters as
      open and close brackets, respectively. For example, &quot;ESC ^F &lt;

      in the top displayed line.</dd>
  <dt id="ESC-_B"><a class="permalink" href="#ESC-_B">ESC-^B</a></dt>
  <dd>Followed by two characters, acts like }, but uses the two characters as
      open and close brackets, respectively. For example, &quot;ESC ^B &lt;

      in the bottom displayed line.</dd>
  <dt id="m"><a class="permalink" href="#m">m</a></dt>
  <dd>Followed by any lowercase or uppercase letter, marks the first displayed

  <dt id="M"><a class="permalink" href="#M">M</a></dt>
  <dd>Acts like m, except the last displayed line is marked rather than the
      first displayed line.</dd>
  <dt>'</dt>
  <dd>(Single quote.) Followed by any lowercase or uppercase letter, returns to
      the position which was previously marked with that letter. Followed by
      another single quote, returns to the position at which the last
      &quot;large&quot; movement command was executed. Followed by a ^ or $,
      jumps to the beginning or end of the file respectively. Marks are
      preserved when a new file is examined, so the ' command can be used to
      switch between input files.</dd>
  <dt>^X^X</dt>
  <dd>Same as single quote.</dd>
  <dt id="ESC-m"><a class="permalink" href="#ESC-m">ESC-m</a></dt>
  <dd>Followed by any lowercase or uppercase letter, clears the mark identified
      by that letter.</dd>
  <dt>/pattern</dt>
  <dd>Search forward in the file for the N-th line containing the pattern. N
      defaults to 1. The pattern is a regular expression, as recognized by the
      regular expression library supplied by your system. The search starts at
      the first line displayed (but see the -a and -j options, which change
      this).
    <p class="Pp">Certain characters are special if entered at the beginning of
        the pattern; they modify the type of search rather than become part of
        the pattern:</p>

  <dd>Examine a new file. If the filename is missing, the &quot;current&quot;
      file (see the :n and :p commands below) from the list of files in the
      command line is re-examined. A percent sign (%) in the filename is
      replaced by the name of the current file. A pound sign (#) is replaced by
      the name of the previously examined file. However, two consecutive percent
      signs are simply replaced with a single percent sign. This allows you to
      enter a filename that contains a percent sign in the name. Similarly, two
      consecutive pound signs are replaced with a single pound sign. The
      filename is inserted into the command line list of files so that it can be
      seen by subsequent :n and :p commands. If the filename consists of several
      files, they are all inserted into the list of files and the first one is
      examined. If the filename contains one or more spaces, the entire filename

      printing of a message describing the new setting, as in the -
    command.</dd>
  <dt>-+</dt>
  <dd>Followed by one of the command line option letters this will reset the
      option to its default setting and print a message describing the new

      is not defined, or defaults to &quot;vi&quot; if neither VISUAL nor EDITOR
      is defined. See also the discussion of LESSEDIT under the section on

  <dt>! shell-command</dt>
  <dd>Invokes a shell to run the shell-command given. A percent sign (%) in the

      replaced by the name of the previously examined file. &quot;!!&quot;
      repeats the last shell command. &quot;!&quot; with no shell command simply
      invokes a shell. On Unix systems, the shell is taken from the environment
      variable SHELL, or defaults to &quot;sh&quot;. On MS-DOS and OS/2 systems,
      the shell is the normal command processor.</dd>
  <dt>| &lt;m&gt; shell-command</dt>
  <dd>&lt;m&gt; represents any mark letter. Pipes a section of the input file to
      the given shell command. The section of the file to be piped is between
      the position marked by the letter and the current screen. The entire
      current screen is included, regardless of whether the marked position is
      before or after the current screen. &lt;m&gt; may also be ^ or $ to
      indicate beginning or end of file respectively. If &lt;m&gt; is . or

<p class="Pp">Command line options are described below. Most options may be
    changed while <i>less</i> is running, via the &quot;-&quot; command.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most options may be given in one of two forms: either a dash
    followed by a single letter, or two dashes followed by a long option name. A
    long option name may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is
    unambiguous. For example, --quit-at-eof may be abbreviated --quit, but not
    --qui, since both --quit-at-eof and --quiet begin with --qui. Some long
    option names are in uppercase, such as --QUIT-AT-EOF, as distinct from
    --quit-at-eof. Such option names need only have their first letter
    capitalized; the remainder of the name may be in either case. For example,
    --Quit-at-eof is equivalent to --QUIT-AT-EOF.</p>
<p class="Pp">Options are also taken from the environment variable
    &quot;LESS&quot;. For example, to avoid typing &quot;less -options ...&quot;
    each time <i>less</i> is invoked, you might tell <i>csh</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp">setenv LESS &quot;-options&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">or if you use <i>sh</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp">LESS=&quot;-options&quot;; export LESS</p>
<p class="Pp">On MS-DOS, you don't need the quotes, but you should replace any
    percent signs in the options string by double percent signs.</p>
<p class="Pp">The environment variable is parsed before the command line, so
    command line options override the LESS environment variable. If an option
    appears in the LESS variable, it can be reset to its default value on the
    command line by beginning the command line option with &quot;-+&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some options like -k or -D require a string to follow the option
    letter. The string for that option is considered to end when a dollar sign
    ($) is found. For example, you can set two -D options on MS-DOS like
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp">LESS=&quot;Dn9.1$Ds4.1&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">If the --use-backslash option appears earlier in the options, then
    a dollar sign or backslash may be included literally in an option string by
    preceding it with a backslash. If the --use-backslash option is not in
    effect, then backslashes are not treated specially, and there is no way to
    include a dollar sign in the option string.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>-? or --help</dt>
  <dd>This option displays a summary of the commands accepted by <i>less</i>
      (the same as the h command). (Depending on how your shell interprets the
      question mark, it may be necessary to quote the question mark, thus:
      &quot;-\?&quot;.)</dd>
  <dt id="a"><a class="permalink" href="#a">-a or --search-skip-screen</a></dt>
  <dd>By default, forward searches start at the top of the displayed screen and
      backwards searches start at the bottom of the displayed screen (except for
      repeated searches invoked by the n or N commands, which start after or
      before the &quot;target&quot; line respectively; see the -j option for
      more about the target line). The -a option causes forward searches to
      instead start at the bottom of the screen and backward searches to start
      at the top of the screen, thus skipping all lines displayed on the
    screen.</dd>
  <dt id="A"><a class="permalink" href="#A">-A or --SEARCH-SKIP-SCREEN</a></dt>
  <dd>Causes all forward searches (not just non-repeated searches) to start just
      after the target line, and all backward searches to start just before the
      target line. Thus, forward searches will skip part of the displayed screen
      (from the first line up to and including the target line). Similarly
      backwards searches will skip the displayed screen from the last line up to
      and including the target line. This was the default behavior in less
      versions prior to 441.</dd>
  <dt>-b<i>n</i> or --buffers=<i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the amount of buffer space <i>less</i> will use for each file,
      in units of kilobytes (1024 bytes). By default 64&#x00A0;KB of buffer
      space is used for each file (unless the file is a pipe; see the -B
      option). The -b option specifies instead that <i>n</i> kilobytes of buffer
      space should be used for each file. If <i>n</i> is -1, buffer space is
      unlimited; that is, the entire file can be read into memory.</dd>
  <dt>-B or --auto-buffers</dt>
  <dd>By default, when data is read from a pipe, buffers are allocated
      automatically as needed. If a large amount of data is read from the pipe,
      this can cause a large amount of memory to be allocated. The -B option
      disables this automatic allocation of buffers for pipes, so that only
      64&#x00A0;KB (or the amount of space specified by the -b option) is used
      for the pipe. Warning: use of -B can result in erroneous display, since
      only the most recently viewed part of the piped data is kept in memory;
      any earlier data is lost.</dd>
  <dt>-c or --clear-screen</dt>
  <dd>Causes full screen repaints to be painted from the top line down. By
      default, full screen repaints are done by scrolling from the bottom of the
      screen.</dd>
  <dt>-C or --CLEAR-SCREEN</dt>
  <dd>Same as -c, for compatibility with older versions of <i>less</i>.</dd>
  <dt>-d or --dumb</dt>
  <dd>The -d option suppresses the error message normally displayed if the
      terminal is dumb; that is, lacks some important capability, such as the
      ability to clear the screen or scroll backward. The -d option does not
      otherwise change the behavior of <i>less</i> on a dumb terminal.</dd>
  <dt id="D"><a class="permalink" href="#D">-D<b>x</b><i>color</i> or
    --color=<b>x</b><i>color</i></a></dt>

</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The uppercase letters can be used only when the
  --use-color option is enabled. When text color is specified by both an
  uppercase letter and a lowercase letter, the uppercase letter takes
  precedence. For example, error messages are normally displayed as standout
  text. So if both &quot;s&quot; and &quot;E&quot; are given a color, the
  &quot;E&quot; color applies to error messages, and the &quot;s&quot; color
  applies to other standout text. The &quot;d&quot; and &quot;u&quot; letters
  refer to bold and underline text formed by overstriking with backspaces (see
  the -u option), not to text using ANSI escape sequences with the -R option.
<p class="Pp">A lowercase letter may be followed by a + to indicate that both
    the normal format change and the specified color should both be used. For
    example, -Dug displays underlined text as green without underlining; the
    green color has replaced the usual underline formatting. But -Du+g displays
    underlined text as both green and in underlined format.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>color</i> is either a 4-bit color string or an 8-bit color
    string:</p>
<p class="Pp">A 4-bit color string is zero, one or two characters, where the
    first character specifies the foreground color and the second specifies the
    background color as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="b"><a class="permalink" href="#b">b</a></dt>
  <dd>Blue</dd>
  <dt id="c"><a class="permalink" href="#c">c</a></dt>
  <dd>Cyan</dd>
  <dt id="g"><a class="permalink" href="#g">g</a></dt>
  <dd>Green</dd>
  <dt id="k~2"><a class="permalink" href="#k~2">k</a></dt>
  <dd>Black</dd>
  <dt id="m~2"><a class="permalink" href="#m~2">m</a></dt>
  <dd>Magenta</dd>
  <dt id="r"><a class="permalink" href="#r">r</a></dt>
  <dd>Red</dd>
  <dt id="w~2"><a class="permalink" href="#w~2">w</a></dt>
  <dd>White</dd>
  <dt id="y"><a class="permalink" href="#y">y</a></dt>
  <dd>Yellow</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The corresponding upper-case letter denotes a brighter shade of
    the color. For example, -DNGk displays line numbers as bright green text on
    a black background, and -DEbR displays error messages as blue text on a
    bright red background. If either character is a &quot;-&quot; or is omitted,
    the corresponding color is set to that of normal text.</p>
<p class="Pp">An 8-bit color string is one or two decimal integers separated by
    a dot, where the first integer specifies the foreground color and the second
    specifies the background color. Each integer is a value between 0 and 255
    inclusive which selects a &quot;CSI 38;5&quot; color value (see
  <br/>
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#SGR_parameters) If either
    integer is a &quot;-&quot; or is omitted, the corresponding color is set to
    that of normal text. On MS-DOS versions of <i>less</i>, 8-bit color is not
    supported; instead, decimal values are interpreted as 4-bit
    CHAR_INFO.Attributes values (see
  <br/>
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/char-info-str).</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="e"><a class="permalink" href="#e">-e or --quit-at-eof</a></dt>
  <dd>Causes <i>less</i> to automatically exit the second time it reaches
      end-of-file. By default, the only way to exit <i>less</i> is via the
      &quot;q&quot; command.</dd>
  <dt>-E or --QUIT-AT-EOF</dt>
  <dd>Causes <i>less</i> to automatically exit the first time it reaches
      end-of-file.</dd>
  <dt id="f"><a class="permalink" href="#f">-f or --force</a></dt>
  <dd>Forces non-regular files to be opened. (A non-regular file is a directory
      or a device special file.) Also suppresses the warning message when a
      binary file is opened. By default, <i>less</i> will refuse to open
      non-regular files. Note that some operating systems will not allow
      directories to be read, even if -f is set.</dd>
  <dt>-F or --quit-if-one-screen</dt>
  <dd>Causes <i>less</i> to automatically exit if the entire file can be
      displayed on the first screen.</dd>
  <dt>-g or --hilite-search</dt>
  <dd>Normally, <i>less</i> will highlight ALL strings which match the last
      search command. The -g option changes this behavior to highlight only the
      particular string which was found by the last search command. This can
      cause <i>less</i> to run somewhat faster than the default.</dd>
  <dt id="G~2"><a class="permalink" href="#G~2">-G or --HILITE-SEARCH</a></dt>
  <dd>The -G option suppresses all highlighting of strings found by search
      commands.</dd>
  <dt id="h~2"><a class="permalink" href="#h~2">-h<i>n</i> or
    --max-back-scroll=<i>n</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a maximum number of lines to scroll backward. If it is necessary
      to scroll backward more than <i>n</i> lines, the screen is repainted in a
      forward direction instead. (If the terminal does not have the ability to
      scroll backward, -h0 is implied.)</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i">-i or --ignore-case</a></dt>
  <dd>Causes searches to ignore case; that is, uppercase and lowercase are
      considered identical. This option is ignored if any uppercase letters
      appear in the search pattern; in other words, if a pattern contains
      uppercase letters, then that search does not ignore case.</dd>
  <dt id="I"><a class="permalink" href="#I">-I or --IGNORE-CASE</a></dt>
  <dd>Like -i, but searches ignore case even if the pattern contains uppercase
      letters.</dd>
  <dt id="j"><a class="permalink" href="#j">-j<i>n</i> or
    --jump-target=<i>n</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a line on the screen where the &quot;target&quot; line is to be
      positioned. The target line is the line specified by any command to search
      for a pattern, jump to a line number, jump to a file percentage or jump to
      a tag. The screen line may be specified by a number: the top line on the
      screen is 1, the next is 2, and so on. The number may be negative to
      specify a line relative to the bottom of the screen: the bottom line on
      the screen is -1, the second to the bottom is -2, and so on. Alternately,
      the screen line may be specified as a fraction of the height of the
      screen, starting with a decimal point: .5 is in the middle of the screen,
      .3 is three tenths down from the first line, and so on. If the line is
      specified as a fraction, the actual line number is recalculated if the
      terminal window is resized, so that the target line remains at the
      specified fraction of the screen height. If any form of the -j option is
      used, repeated forward searches (invoked with &quot;n&quot; or
      &quot;N&quot;) begin at the line immediately after the target line, and
      repeated backward searches begin at the target line, unless changed by -a
      or -A. For example, if &quot;-j4&quot; is used, the target line is the
      fourth line on the screen, so forward searches begin at the fifth line on
      the screen. However nonrepeated searches (invoked with &quot;/&quot; or
      &quot;?&quot;) always begin at the start or end of the current screen
      respectively.</dd>
  <dt>-J or --status-column</dt>
  <dd>Displays a status column at the left edge of the screen. The status column
      shows the lines that matched the current search, and any lines that are
      marked (via the m or M command).</dd>
  <dt>-k<i>filename</i> or --lesskey-file=<i>filename</i></dt>
  <dd>Causes <i>less</i> to open and interpret the named file as a
      <i>lesskey</i>(1) file. Multiple -k options may be specified. If the
      LESSKEY or LESSKEY_SYSTEM environment variable is set, or if a lesskey
      file is found in a standard place (see KEY BINDINGS), it is also used as a
      <i>lesskey</i> file.</dd>
  <dt id="K~2"><a class="permalink" href="#K~2">-K or --quit-on-intr</a></dt>
  <dd>Causes <i>less</i> to exit immediately (with status 2) when an interrupt
      character (usually ^C) is typed. Normally, an interrupt character causes
      <i>less</i> to stop whatever it is doing and return to its command prompt.
      Note that use of this option makes it impossible to return to the command
      prompt from the &quot;F&quot; command.</dd>
  <dt id="L"><a class="permalink" href="#L">-L or --no-lessopen</a></dt>
  <dd>Ignore the LESSOPEN environment variable (see the INPUT PREPROCESSOR
      section below). This option can be set from within <i>less</i>, but it
      will apply only to files opened subsequently, not to the file which is
      currently open.</dd>
  <dt>-m or --long-prompt</dt>
  <dd>Causes <i>less</i> to prompt verbosely (like <i>more</i>), with the
      percent into the file. By default, <i>less</i> prompts with a colon.</dd>
  <dt>-M or --LONG-PROMPT</dt>
  <dd>Causes <i>less</i> to prompt even more verbosely than <i>more</i>.</dd>
  <dt>-n or --line-numbers</dt>
  <dd>Suppresses line numbers. The default (to use line numbers) may cause
      <i>less</i> to run more slowly in some cases, especially with a very large
      input file. Suppressing line numbers with the -n option will avoid this
      problem. Using line numbers means: the line number will be displayed in
      the verbose prompt and in the = command, and the v command will pass the
      current line number to the editor (see also the discussion of LESSEDIT in
      PROMPTS below).</dd>
  <dt>-N or --LINE-NUMBERS</dt>
  <dd>Causes a line number to be displayed at the beginning of each line in the
      display.</dd>
  <dt id="o"><a class="permalink" href="#o">-o<i>filename</i> or
    --log-file=<i>filename</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Causes <i>less</i> to copy its input to the named file as it is being
      viewed. This applies only when the input file is a pipe, not an ordinary
      file. If the file already exists, <i>less</i> will ask for confirmation
      before overwriting it.</dd>
  <dt id="O"><a class="permalink" href="#O">-O<i>filename</i> or
    --LOG-FILE=<i>filename</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The -O option is like -o, but it will overwrite an existing file without
      asking for confirmation.
    <p class="Pp">If no log file has been specified, the -o and -O options can
        be used from within <i>less</i> to specify a log file. Without a file
        name, they will simply report the name of the log file. The
        &quot;s&quot; command is equivalent to specifying -o from within
        <i>less</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="p~2"><a class="permalink" href="#p~2">-p<i>pattern</i> or
    --pattern=<i>pattern</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The -p option on the command line is equivalent to specifying
      +/<i>pattern</i>; that is, it tells <i>less</i> to start at the first
      occurrence of <i>pattern</i> in the file.</dd>
  <dt>-P<i>prompt</i> or --prompt=<i>prompt</i></dt>
  <dd>Provides a way to tailor the three prompt styles to your own preference.
      This option would normally be put in the LESS environment variable, rather
      than being typed in with each <i>less</i> command. Such an option must
      either be the last option in the LESS variable, or be terminated by a
      dollar sign.
    <br/>
     -Ps followed by a string changes the default (short) prompt to that string.
    <br/>
     -Pm changes the medium (-m) prompt.
    <br/>
     -PM changes the long (-M) prompt.
    <br/>
     -Ph changes the prompt for the help screen.
    <br/>
     -P= changes the message printed by the = command.
    <br/>
     -Pw changes the message printed while waiting for data (in the F command).
    <p class="Pp">All prompt strings consist of a sequence of letters and
        special escape sequences. See the section on PROMPTS for more
      details.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="q~2"><a class="permalink" href="#q~2">-q or --quiet or
    --silent</a></dt>
  <dd>Causes moderately &quot;quiet&quot; operation: the terminal bell is not
      rung if an attempt is made to scroll past the end of the file or before
      the beginning of the file. If the terminal has a &quot;visual bell&quot;,
      it is used instead. The bell will be rung on certain other errors, such as
      typing an invalid character. The default is to ring the terminal bell in
      all such cases.</dd>
  <dt id="Q"><a class="permalink" href="#Q">-Q or --QUIET or --SILENT</a></dt>
  <dd>Causes totally &quot;quiet&quot; operation: the terminal bell is never
      rung. If the terminal has a &quot;visual bell&quot;, it is used in all
      cases where the terminal bell would have been rung.</dd>
  <dt>-r or --raw-control-chars</dt>
  <dd>Causes &quot;raw&quot; control characters to be displayed. The default is
      to display control characters using the caret notation; for example, a
      control-A (octal 001) is displayed as &quot;^A&quot;. Warning: when the -r
      option is used, <i>less</i> cannot keep track of the actual appearance of
      the screen (since this depends on how the screen responds to each type of
      control character). Thus, various display problems may result, such as
      long lines being split in the wrong place.
    <p class="Pp">USE OF THE -r OPTION IS NOT RECOMMENDED.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-R or --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS</dt>
  <dd>Like -r, but only ANSI &quot;color&quot; escape sequences and OSC 8
      hyperlink sequences are output in &quot;raw&quot; form. Unlike -r, the
      screen appearance is maintained correctly, provided that there are no
      escape sequences in the file other than these types of escape sequences.
      Color escape sequences are only supported when the color is changed within
      one line, not across lines. In other words, the beginning of each line is
      assumed to be normal (non-colored), regardless of any escape sequences in
      previous lines. For the purpose of keeping track of screen appearance,
      these escape sequences are assumed to not move the cursor.
    <p class="Pp">OSC 8 hyperlinks are sequences of the form:</p>
    <p class="Pp">	ESC ] 8 ; ... \7</p>
    <p class="Pp">The terminating sequence may be either a BEL character (\7) or
        the two-character sequence &quot;ESC \&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">ANSI color escape sequences are sequences of the form:</p>
    <p class="Pp">	ESC [ ... m</p>
    <p class="Pp">where the &quot;...&quot; is zero or more color specification
        characters. You can make <i>less</i> think that characters other than
        &quot;m&quot; can end ANSI color escape sequences by setting the
        environment variable LESSANSIENDCHARS to the list of characters which
        can end a color escape sequence. And you can make <i>less</i> think that
        characters other than the standard ones may appear between the ESC and
        the m by setting the environment variable LESSANSIMIDCHARS to the list
        of characters which can appear.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-s or --squeeze-blank-lines</dt>
  <dd>Causes consecutive blank lines to be squeezed into a single blank line.
      This is useful when viewing <i>nroff</i> output.</dd>
  <dt>-S or --chop-long-lines</dt>
  <dd>Causes lines longer than the screen width to be chopped (truncated) rather
      than wrapped. That is, the portion of a long line that does not fit in the
      screen width is not displayed until you press RIGHT-ARROW. The default is
      to wrap long lines; that is, display the remainder on the next line.</dd>
  <dt>-t<i>tag</i> or --tag=<i>tag</i></dt>
  <dd>The -t option, followed immediately by a TAG, will edit the file
      containing that tag. For this to work, tag information must be available;
      for example, there may be a file in the current directory called
      &quot;tags&quot;, which was previously built by <i>ctags</i>(1) or an
      equivalent command. If the environment variable LESSGLOBALTAGS is set, it
      is taken to be the name of a command compatible with <i>global</i>(1), and
      that command is executed to find the tag. (See
      http://www.gnu.org/software/global/global.html). The -t option may also be
      specified from within <i>less</i> (using the - command) as a way of
      examining a new file. The command &quot;:t&quot; is equivalent to
      specifying -t from within <i>less</i>.</dd>
  <dt>-T<i>tagsfile</i> or --tag-file=<i>tagsfile</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a tags file to be used instead of &quot;tags&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>-u or --underline-special</dt>
  <dd>Causes backspaces and carriage returns to be treated as printable
      characters; that is, they are sent to the terminal when they appear in the
      input.</dd>
  <dt id="U"><a class="permalink" href="#U">-U or --UNDERLINE-SPECIAL</a></dt>
  <dd>Causes backspaces, tabs, carriage returns and &quot;formatting
      characters&quot; (as defined by Unicode) to be treated as control
      characters; that is, they are handled as specified by the -r option.
    <p class="Pp">By default, if neither -u nor -U is given, backspaces which
        appear adjacent to an underscore character are treated specially: the
        underlined text is displayed using the terminal's hardware underlining
        capability. Also, backspaces which appear between two identical
        characters are treated specially: the overstruck text is printed using
        the terminal's hardware boldface capability. Other backspaces are
        deleted, along with the preceding character. Carriage returns
        immediately followed by a newline are deleted. Other carriage returns
        are handled as specified by the -r option. Unicode formatting
        characters, such as the Byte Order Mark, are sent to the terminal. Text
        which is overstruck or underlined can be searched for if neither -u nor
        -U is in effect.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>-V or --version</dt>
  <dd>Displays the version number of <i>less</i>.</dd>
  <dt>-w or --hilite-unread</dt>
  <dd>Temporarily highlights the first &quot;new&quot; line after a forward
      movement of a full page. The first &quot;new&quot; line is the line
      immediately following the line previously at the bottom of the screen.
      Also highlights the target line after a g or p command. The highlight is
      removed at the next command which causes movement. The entire line is
      highlighted, unless the -J option is in effect, in which case only the
      status column is highlighted.</dd>
  <dt>-W or --HILITE-UNREAD</dt>
  <dd>Like -w, but temporarily highlights the first new line after any forward
      movement command larger than one line.</dd>
  <dt id="x"><a class="permalink" href="#x">-x<i>n</i>,... or
    --tabs=<i>n</i>,...</a></dt>
  <dd>Sets tab stops. If only one <i>n</i> is specified, tab stops are set at
      multiples of <i>n</i>. If multiple values separated by commas are
      specified, tab stops are set at those positions, and then continue with
      the same spacing as the last two. For example, <i>-x9,17</i> will set tabs
      at positions 9, 17, 25, 33, etc. The default for <i>n</i> is 8.</dd>
  <dt id="X"><a class="permalink" href="#X">-X or --no-init</a></dt>
  <dd>Disables sending the termcap initialization and deinitialization strings
      to the terminal. This is sometimes desirable if the deinitialization
      string does something unnecessary, like clearing the screen.</dd>
  <dt>-y<i>n</i> or --max-forw-scroll=<i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a maximum number of lines to scroll forward. If it is necessary
      to scroll forward more than <i>n</i> lines, the screen is repainted
      instead. The -c or -C option may be used to repaint from the top of the
      screen if desired. By default, any forward movement causes scrolling.</dd>
  <dt>-z<i>n</i> or --window=<i>n</i> or -<i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>Changes the default scrolling window size to <i>n</i> lines. The default
      is one screenful. The z and w commands can also be used to change the
      window size. The &quot;z&quot; may be omitted for compatibility with some
      versions of <i>more</i>. If the number <i>n</i> is negative, it indicates
      <i>n</i> lines less than the current screen size. For example, if the
      screen is 24 lines, <i>-z-4</i> sets the scrolling window to 20 lines. If
      the screen is resized to 40 lines, the scrolling window automatically
      changes to 36 lines.</dd>
  <dt>-&quot;<i>cc</i>&#x00A0;or&#x00A0;--quotes=<i>cc</i></dt>
  <dd>Changes the filename quoting character. This may be necessary if you are
      trying to name a file which contains both spaces and quote characters.
      Followed by a single character, this changes the quote character to that
      character. Filenames containing a space should then be surrounded by that
      character rather than by double quotes. Followed by two characters,
      changes the open quote to the first character, and the close quote to the
      second character. Filenames containing a space should then be preceded by
      the open quote character and followed by the close quote character. Note
      that even after the quote characters are changed, this option remains
      -&quot; (a dash followed by a double quote).</dd>
  <dt>-~ or --tilde</dt>
  <dd>Normally lines after end of file are displayed as a single tilde (~). This
      option causes lines after end of file to be displayed as blank lines.</dd>
  <dt>-# or --shift</dt>
  <dd>Specifies the default number of positions to scroll horizontally in the
      RIGHTARROW and LEFTARROW commands. If the number specified is zero, it
      sets the default number of positions to one half of the screen width.
      Alternately, the number may be specified as a fraction of the width of the
      screen, starting with a decimal point: .5 is half of the screen width, .3
      is three tenths of the screen width, and so on. If the number is specified
      as a fraction, the actual number of scroll positions is recalculated if
      the terminal window is resized, so that the actual scroll remains at the
      specified fraction of the screen width.</dd>
  <dt id="follow-name"><a class="permalink" href="#follow-name">--follow-name</a></dt>
  <dd>Normally, if the input file is renamed while an F command is executing,
      <i>less</i> will continue to display the contents of the original file
      despite its name change. If --follow-name is specified, during an F
      command <i>less</i> will periodically attempt to reopen the file by name.
      If the reopen succeeds and the file is a different file from the original
      (which means that a new file has been created with the same name as the
      original (now renamed) file), <i>less</i> will display the contents of
      that new file.</dd>
  <dt id="incsearch"><a class="permalink" href="#incsearch">--incsearch</a></dt>
  <dd>Subsequent search commands will be &quot;incremental&quot;; that is,
      <i>less</i> will advance to the next line containing the search pattern as
      each character of the pattern is typed in.</dd>
  <dt id="line-num-width"><a class="permalink" href="#line-num-width">--line-num-width</a></dt>
  <dd>Sets the minimum width of the line number field when the -N option is in
      effect. The default is 7 characters.</dd>
  <dt id="mouse"><a class="permalink" href="#mouse">--mouse</a></dt>
  <dd>Enables mouse input: scrolling the mouse wheel down moves forward in the
      file, scrolling the mouse wheel up moves backwards in the file, and
      clicking the mouse sets the &quot;#&quot; mark to the line where the mouse
      is clicked. The number of lines to scroll when the wheel is moved can be
      set by the --wheel-lines option. Mouse input works only on terminals which
      support X11 mouse reporting, and on the Windows version of
    <i>less</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="MOUSE"><a class="permalink" href="#MOUSE">--MOUSE</a></dt>
  <dd>Like --mouse, except the direction scrolled on mouse wheel movement is
      reversed.</dd>
  <dt id="no-keypad"><a class="permalink" href="#no-keypad">--no-keypad</a></dt>
  <dd>Disables sending the keypad initialization and deinitialization strings to
      the terminal. This is sometimes useful if the keypad strings make the
      numeric keypad behave in an undesirable manner.</dd>
  <dt id="no-histdups"><a class="permalink" href="#no-histdups">--no-histdups</a></dt>
  <dd>This option changes the behavior so that if a search string or file name
      is typed in, and the same string is already in the history list, the
      existing copy is removed from the history list before the new one is
      added. Thus, a given string will appear only once in the history list.
      Normally, a string may appear multiple times.</dd>
  <dt id="rscroll"><a class="permalink" href="#rscroll">--rscroll</a></dt>
  <dd>This option changes the character used to mark truncated lines. It may
      begin with a two-character attribute indicator like LESSBINFMT does. If
      there is no attribute indicator, standout is used. If set to
      &quot;-&quot;, truncated lines are not marked.</dd>
  <dt id="save-marks"><a class="permalink" href="#save-marks">--save-marks</a></dt>
  <dd>Save marks in the history file, so marks are retained across different
      invocations of <i>less</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="status-col-width"><a class="permalink" href="#status-col-width">--status-col-width</a></dt>
  <dd>Sets the width of the status column when the -J option is in effect. The
      default is 2 characters.</dd>
  <dt id="use-backslash"><a class="permalink" href="#use-backslash">--use-backslash</a></dt>
  <dd>This option changes the interpretations of options which follow this one.
      After the --use-backslash option, any backslash in an option string is
      removed and the following character is taken literally. This allows a
      dollar sign to be included in option strings.</dd>
  <dt id="use-color"><a class="permalink" href="#use-color">--use-color</a></dt>
  <dd>Enables the colored text in various places. The -D option can be used to
      change the colors. Colored text works only if the terminal supports ANSI
      color escape sequences (as defined in ECMA-48 SGR; see
    <br/>
    https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-48).</dd>
  <dt id="wheel-lines="><a class="permalink" href="#wheel-lines=">--wheel-lines=<i>n</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Set the number of lines to scroll when the mouse wheel is scrolled and the
      --mouse or --MOUSE option is in effect. The default is 1 line.</dd>
  <dt>--</dt>
  <dd>A command line argument of &quot;--&quot; marks the end of option
      arguments. Any arguments following this are interpreted as filenames. This
      can be useful when viewing a file whose name begins with a &quot;-&quot;
      or &quot;+&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>+</dt>
  <dd>If a command line option begins with <b>+</b>, the remainder of that
      option is taken to be an initial command to <i>less</i>. For example, +G
      tells <i>less</i> to start at the end of the file rather than the
      beginning, and +/xyz tells it to start at the first occurrence of
      &quot;xyz&quot; in the file. As a special case, +&lt;number&gt; acts like
      +&lt;number&gt;g; that is, it starts the display at the specified line
      number (however, see the caveat under the &quot;g&quot; command above). If
      the option starts with ++, the initial command applies to every file being
      viewed, not just the first one. The + command described previously may
      also be used to set (or change) an initial command for every file.</dd>

    commands have an alternate form in [ brackets ] which can be used if a key
    does not exist on a particular keyboard. (Note that the forms beginning with
    ESC do not work in some MS-DOS and Windows systems because ESC is the line
    erase character.) Any of these special keys may be entered literally by

<h1 class="Sh" id="KEY_BINDINGS"><a class="permalink" href="#KEY_BINDINGS">KEY
  BINDINGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">You may define your own <i>less</i> commands by using the program
    <i>lesskey</i>(1) to create a lesskey file. This file specifies a set of
    command keys and an action associated with each key. You may also use
    <i>lesskey</i> to change the line-editing keys (see LINE EDITING), and to
    set environment variables. If the environment variable LESSKEY is set,
    <i>less</i> uses that as the name of the lesskey file. Otherwise,
    <i>less</i> looks in a standard place for the lesskey file: On Unix systems,
    <i>less</i> looks for a lesskey file called &quot;$HOME/.less&quot;. On
    MS-DOS and Windows systems, <i>less</i> looks for a lesskey file called
    &quot;$HOME/_less&quot;, and if it is not found there, then looks for a
    lesskey file called &quot;_less&quot; in any directory specified in the PATH
    environment variable. On OS/2 systems, <i>less</i> looks for a lesskey file
    called &quot;$HOME/less.ini&quot;, and if it is not found, then looks for a
    lesskey file called &quot;less.ini&quot; in any directory specified in the
    INIT environment variable, and if it not found there, then looks for a
    lesskey file called &quot;less.ini&quot; in any directory specified in the
    PATH environment variable. See the <i>lesskey</i> manual page for more
    details.</p>
<p class="Pp">A system-wide lesskey file may also be set up to provide key
    bindings. If a key is defined in both a local lesskey file and in the
    system-wide file, key bindings in the local file take precedence over those
    in the system-wide file. If the environment variable LESSKEY_SYSTEM is set,
    <i>less</i> uses that as the name of the system-wide lesskey file.
    Otherwise, <i>less</i> looks in a standard place for the system-wide lesskey
    file: On Unix systems, the system-wide lesskey file is
    /usr/local/etc/sysless. (However, if <i>less</i> was built with a different
    sysconf directory than /usr/local/etc, that directory is where the sysless
    file is found.) On MS-DOS and Windows systems, the system-wide lesskey file
    is c:\_sysless. On OS/2 systems, the system-wide lesskey file is
    c:\sysless.ini.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INPUT_PREPROCESSOR"><a class="permalink" href="#INPUT_PREPROCESSOR">INPUT
  PREPROCESSOR</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">You may define an &quot;input preprocessor&quot; for <i>less</i>.
    Before <i>less</i> opens a file, it first gives your input preprocessor a
    chance to modify the way the contents of the file are displayed. An input
    preprocessor is simply an executable program (or shell script), which writes
    the contents of the file to a different file, called the replacement file.
    The contents of the replacement file are then displayed in place of the
    contents of the original file. However, it will appear to the user as if the
    original file is opened; that is, <i>less</i> will display the original
    filename as the name of the current file.</p>
<p class="Pp">An input preprocessor receives one command line argument, the
    original filename, as entered by the user. It should create the replacement
    file, and when finished, print the name of the replacement file to its
    standard output. If the input preprocessor does not output a replacement
    filename, <i>less</i> uses the original file, as normal. The input
    preprocessor is not called when viewing standard input. To set up an input
    preprocessor, set the LESSOPEN environment variable to a command line which
    will invoke your input preprocessor. This command line should include one
    occurrence of the string &quot;%s&quot;, which will be replaced by the
    filename when the input preprocessor command is invoked.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <i>less</i> closes a file opened in such a way, it will call
    another program, called the input postprocessor, which may perform any
    desired clean-up action (such as deleting the replacement file created by
    LESSOPEN). This program receives two command line arguments, the original
    filename as entered by the user, and the name of the replacement file. To
    set up an input postprocessor, set the LESSCLOSE environment variable to a
    command line which will invoke your input postprocessor. It may include two
    occurrences of the string &quot;%s&quot;; the first is replaced with the
    original name of the file and the second with the name of the replacement
    file, which was output by LESSOPEN.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, on many Unix systems, these two scripts will allow
    you to keep files in compressed format, but still let <i>less</i> view them
    directly:</p>
<p class="Pp">lessopen.sh:
  <br/>
  	#! /bin/sh
  <br/>
  	case &quot;$1&quot; in
  <br/>
  	*.Z)	TEMPFILE=$(mktemp)
  <br/>
  		uncompress -c $1 &gt;$TEMPFILE 2&gt;/dev/null
  <br/>
  		if [ -s $TEMPFILE ]; then
  <br/>
  			echo $TEMPFILE
  <br/>
  		else
  <br/>
  			rm -f $TEMPFILE
  <br/>
  		fi
  <br/>
  		;;
  <br/>
  	esac</p>
<p class="Pp">lessclose.sh:
  <br/>
  	#! /bin/sh
  <br/>
  	rm $2</p>
<p class="Pp">To use these scripts, put them both where they can be executed and
    set LESSOPEN=&quot;lessopen.sh&#x00A0;%s&quot;, and
    LESSCLOSE=&quot;lessclose.sh&#x00A0;%s&#x00A0;%s&quot;. More complex
    LESSOPEN and LESSCLOSE scripts may be written to accept other types of
    compressed files, and so on.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is also possible to set up an input preprocessor to pipe the
    file data directly to <i>less</i>, rather than putting the data into a
    replacement file. This avoids the need to decompress the entire file before
    starting to view it. An input preprocessor that works this way is called an
    input pipe. An input pipe, instead of writing the name of a replacement file
    on its standard output, writes the entire contents of the replacement file
    on its standard output. If the input pipe does not write any characters on
    its standard output, then there is no replacement file and <i>less</i> uses
    the original file, as normal. To use an input pipe, make the first character
    in the LESSOPEN environment variable a vertical bar (|) to signify that the
    input preprocessor is an input pipe. As with non-pipe input preprocessors,
    the command string must contain one occurrence of %s, which is replaced with
    the filename of the input file.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, on many Unix systems, this script will work like the
    previous example scripts:</p>
<p class="Pp">lesspipe.sh:
  <br/>
  	#! /bin/sh
  <br/>
  	case &quot;$1&quot; in
  <br/>
  	*.Z)	uncompress -c $1 2&gt;/dev/null
  <br/>
  		;;
  <br/>
  	*)	exit 1
  <br/>
  		;;
  <br/>
  	esac
  <br/>
  	exit $?
  <br/>
</p>
<p class="Pp">To use this script, put it where it can be executed and set
    LESSOPEN=&quot;|lesspipe.sh %s&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that a preprocessor cannot output an empty file, since that
    is interpreted as meaning there is no replacement, and the original file is
    used. To avoid this, if LESSOPEN starts with two vertical bars, the exit
    status of the script becomes meaningful. If the exit status is zero, the
    output is considered to be replacement text, even if it is empty. If the
    exit status is nonzero, any output is ignored and the original file is used.
    For compatibility with previous versions of <i>less</i>, if LESSOPEN starts
    with only one vertical bar, the exit status of the preprocessor is
  ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">When an input pipe is used, a LESSCLOSE postprocessor can be used,
    but it is usually not necessary since there is no replacement file to clean
    up. In this case, the replacement file name passed to the LESSCLOSE
    postprocessor is &quot;-&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">For compatibility with previous versions of <i>less</i>, the input
    preprocessor or pipe is not used if <i>less</i> is viewing standard input.
    However, if the first character of LESSOPEN is a dash (-), the input
    preprocessor is used on standard input as well as other files. In this case,
    the dash is not considered to be part of the preprocessor command. If
    standard input is being viewed, the input preprocessor is passed a file name
    consisting of a single dash. Similarly, if the first two characters of
    LESSOPEN are vertical bar and dash (|-) or two vertical bars and a dash
    (||-), the input pipe is used on standard input as well as other files.
    Again, in this case the dash is not considered to be part of the input pipe
    command.</p>

<p class="Pp">In rare cases, it may be desired to tailor <i>less</i> to use a
    character set other than the ones definable by LESSCHARSET. In this case,
    the environment variable LESSCHARDEF can be used to define a character set.
    It should be set to a string where each character in the string represents
    one character in the character set. The character &quot;.&quot; is used for
    a normal character, &quot;c&quot; for control, and &quot;b&quot; for binary.
    A decimal number may be used for repetition. For example,
    &quot;bccc4b.&quot; would mean character 0 is binary, 1, 2 and 3 are
    control, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are binary, and 8 is normal. All characters after the
    last are taken to be the same as the last, so characters 9 through 255 would
    be normal. (This is an example, and does not necessarily represent any real
    character set.)</p>

    each of the possible values for LESSCHARSET:</p>

<p class="Pp">If neither LESSCHARSET nor LESSCHARDEF is set, but any of the
    strings &quot;UTF-8&quot;, &quot;UTF8&quot;, &quot;utf-8&quot; or
    &quot;utf8&quot; is found in the LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE or LANG environment
    variables, then the default character set is utf-8.</p>
<p class="Pp">If that string is not found, but your system supports the
    <i>setlocale</i> interface, <i>less</i> will use setlocale to determine the
    character set. setlocale is controlled by setting the LANG or LC_CTYPE
    environment variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, if the <i>setlocale</i> interface is also not available,
    the default character set is latin1.</p>
<p class="Pp">Control and binary characters are displayed in standout (reverse
    video). Each such character is displayed in caret notation if possible (e.g.
    ^A for control-A). Caret notation is used only if inverting the 0100 bit
    results in a normal printable character. Otherwise, the character is
    displayed as a hex number in angle brackets. This format can be changed by
    setting the LESSBINFMT environment variable. LESSBINFMT may begin with a
    &quot;*&quot; and one character to select the display attribute:
    &quot;*k&quot; is blinking, &quot;*d&quot; is bold, &quot;*u&quot; is
    underlined, &quot;*s&quot; is standout, and &quot;*n&quot; is normal. If
    LESSBINFMT does not begin with a &quot;*&quot;, normal attribute is assumed.
    The remainder of LESSBINFMT is a string which may include one printf-style
    escape sequence (a % followed by x, X, o, d, etc.). For example, if
    LESSBINFMT is &quot;*u[%x]&quot;, binary characters are displayed in
    underlined hexadecimal surrounded by brackets. The default if no LESSBINFMT
    is specified is &quot;*s&lt;%02X&gt;&quot;. Warning: the result of expanding
    the character via LESSBINFMT must be less than 31 characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the character set is utf-8, the LESSUTFBINFMT environment
    variable acts similarly to LESSBINFMT but it applies to Unicode code points
    that were successfully decoded but are unsuitable for display (e.g.,
    unassigned code points). Its default value is &quot;&lt;U+%04lX&gt;&quot;.
    Note that LESSUTFBINFMT and LESSBINFMT share their display attribute setting
    (&quot;*x&quot;) so specifying one will affect both; LESSUTFBINFMT is read
    after LESSBINFMT so its setting, if any, will have priority. Problematic
    octets in a UTF-8 file (octets of a truncated sequence, octets of a complete
    but non-shortest form sequence, invalid octets, and stray trailing octets)
    are displayed individually using LESSBINFMT so as to facilitate diagnostic
    of how the UTF-8 file is ill-formed.</p>

<p class="Pp">The -P option allows you to tailor the prompt to your preference.
    The string given to the -P option replaces the specified prompt string.
    Certain characters in the string are interpreted specially. The prompt
    mechanism is rather complicated to provide flexibility, but the ordinary
    user need not understand the details of constructing personalized prompt
    strings.</p>
<p class="Pp">A percent sign followed by a single character is expanded
    according to what the following character is:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>%b<i>X</i></dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the byte offset into the current input file. The b is followed
      by a single character (shown as <i>X</i> above) which specifies the line
      whose byte offset is to be used. If the character is a &quot;t&quot;, the
      byte offset of the top line in the display is used, an &quot;m&quot; means
      use the middle line, a &quot;b&quot; means use the bottom line, a
      &quot;B&quot; means use the line just after the bottom line, and a
      &quot;j&quot; means use the &quot;target&quot; line, as specified by the
      -j option.</dd>
  <dt>%B</dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the size of the current input file.</dd>
  <dt>%c</dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the column number of the text appearing in the first column of
      the screen.</dd>
  <dt>%d<i>X</i></dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the page number of a line in the input file. The line to be
      used is determined by the <i>X</i>, as with the %b option.</dd>
  <dt>%D</dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the number of pages in the input file, or equivalently, the
      page number of the last line in the input file.</dd>
  <dt>%E</dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the name of the editor (from the VISUAL environment variable,
      or the EDITOR environment variable if VISUAL is not defined). See the
      discussion of the LESSEDIT feature below.</dd>
  <dt>%f</dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the name of the current input file.</dd>
  <dt>%F</dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the last component of the name of the current input file.</dd>
  <dt>%g</dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the shell-escaped name of the current input file. This is
      useful when the expanded string will be used in a shell command, such as
      in LESSEDIT.</dd>
  <dt>%i</dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the index of the current file in the list of input files.</dd>
  <dt>%l<i>X</i></dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the line number of a line in the input file. The line to be
      used is determined by the <i>X</i>, as with the %b option.</dd>
  <dt>%L</dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the line number of the last line in the input file.</dd>
  <dt>%m</dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the total number of input files.</dd>
  <dt>%p<i>X</i></dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the percent into the current input file, based on byte
      offsets. The line used is determined by the <i>X</i> as with the %b
      option.</dd>
  <dt>%P<i>X</i></dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the percent into the current input file, based on line
      numbers. The line used is determined by the <i>X</i> as with the %b
      option.</dd>
  <dt>%s</dt>
  <dd>Same as %B.</dd>
  <dt>%t</dt>
  <dd>Causes any trailing spaces to be removed. Usually used at the end of the
      string, but may appear anywhere.</dd>
  <dt>%T</dt>
  <dd>Normally expands to the word &quot;file&quot;. However if viewing files
      via a tags list using the -t option, it expands to the word
      &quot;tag&quot;.</dd>
  <dt>%x</dt>
  <dd>Replaced by the name of the next input file in the list.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If any item is unknown (for example, the file size if input is a
    pipe), a question mark is printed instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">The format of the prompt string can be changed depending on
    certain conditions. A question mark followed by a single character acts like
    an &quot;IF&quot;: depending on the following character, a condition is
    evaluated. If the condition is true, any characters following the question
    mark and condition character, up to a period, are included in the prompt. If
    the condition is false, such characters are not included. A colon appearing
    between the question mark and the period can be used to establish an
    &quot;ELSE&quot;: any characters between the colon and the period are
    included in the string if and only if the IF condition is false. Condition
    characters (which follow a question mark) may be:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>?a</dt>
  <dd>True if any characters have been included in the prompt so far.</dd>
  <dt>?b<i>X</i></dt>
  <dd>True if the byte offset of the specified line is known.</dd>
  <dt>?B</dt>
  <dd>True if the size of current input file is known.</dd>
  <dt>?c</dt>
  <dd>True if the text is horizontally shifted (%c is not zero).</dd>
  <dt>?d<i>X</i></dt>
  <dd>True if the page number of the specified line is known.</dd>

  <dd>True if at end-of-file.</dd>

  <dt>?s</dt>
  <dd>Same as &quot;?B&quot;.</dd>

<p class="Pp">Any characters other than the special ones (question mark, colon,
    period, percent, and backslash) become literally part of the prompt. Any of
    the special characters may be included in the prompt literally by preceding
    it with a backslash.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some examples:</p>
<p class="Pp">?f%f:Standard input.</p>
<p class="Pp">This prompt prints the filename, if known; otherwise the string
    &quot;Standard input&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">?f%f .?ltLine %lt:?pt%pt\%:?btByte %bt:-...</p>
<p class="Pp">This prompt would print the filename, if known. The filename is
    followed by the line number, if known, otherwise the percent if known,
    otherwise the byte offset if known. Otherwise, a dash is printed. Notice how
    each question mark has a matching period, and how the % after the %pt is
    included literally by escaping it with a backslash.</p>
<p class="Pp">?n?f%f&#x00A0;.?m(%T %i of
    %m)&#x00A0;..?e(END)&#x00A0;?x-&#x00A0;Next\:&#x00A0;%x..%t&quot;;</p>
<p class="Pp">This prints the filename if this is the first prompt in a file,
    followed by the &quot;file N of N&quot; message if there is more than one
    input file. Then, if we are at end-of-file, the string &quot;(END)&quot; is
    printed followed by the name of the next file, if there is one. Finally, any
    trailing spaces are truncated. This is the default prompt. For reference,
    here are the defaults for the other two prompts (-m and -M respectively).
    Each is broken into two lines here for readability only.</p>
<pre>
?n?f%f&#x00A0;.?m(%T&#x00A0;%i&#x00A0;of&#x00A0;%m)&#x00A0;..?e(END)&#x00A0;?x-&#x00A0;Next\:&#x00A0;%x.:
	?pB%pB\%:byte&#x00A0;%bB?s/%s...%t

?f%f&#x00A0;.?n?m(%T&#x00A0;%i&#x00A0;of&#x00A0;%m)&#x00A0;..?ltlines&#x00A0;%lt-%lb?L/%L.&#x00A0;:
	byte&#x00A0;%bB?s/%s.&#x00A0;.?e(END)&#x00A0;?x-&#x00A0;Next\:&#x00A0;%x.:?pB%pB\%..%t

</pre>
And here is the default message produced by the = command:
<pre>
?f%f&#x00A0;.?m(%T&#x00A0;%i&#x00A0;of&#x00A0;%m)&#x00A0;.?ltlines&#x00A0;%lt-%lb?L/%L.&#x00A0;.
	byte&#x00A0;%bB?s/%s.&#x00A0;?e(END)&#x00A0;:?pB%pB\%..%t</pre>
<p class="Pp">The prompt expansion features are also used for another purpose:
    if an environment variable LESSEDIT is defined, it is used as the command to
    be executed when the v command is invoked. The LESSEDIT string is expanded
    in the same way as the prompt strings. The default value for LESSEDIT
  is:</p>
<pre>
	%E&#x00A0;?lm+%lm.&#x00A0;%g

</pre>
Note that this expands to the editor name, followed by a + and the line number,
  followed by the shell-escaped file name. If your editor does not accept the
  &quot;+linenumber&quot; syntax, or has other differences in invocation syntax,
  the LESSEDIT variable can be changed to modify this default.
