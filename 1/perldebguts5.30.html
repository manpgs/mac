<p class="Pp">This is not perldebug, which tells you how to use the debugger.
    This manpage describes low-level details concerning the debugger's
    internals, which range from difficult to impossible to understand for anyone
    who isn't incredibly intimate with Perl's guts. Caveat lector.</p>

  Internals</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Perl has special debugging hooks at compile-time and run-time used
    to create debugging environments. These hooks are not to be confused with
    the <i>perl -Dxxx</i> command described in perlrun, which is usable only if
    a special Perl is built per the instructions in the <i>INSTALL</i> podpage
    in the Perl source tree.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, whenever you call Perl's built-in
    <span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span> function from the package
    <span class="Li">&quot;DB&quot;</span>, the arguments that the corresponding
    stack frame was called with are copied to the
    <span class="Li">@DB::args</span> array. These mechanisms are enabled by
    calling Perl with the <b>-d</b> switch. Specifically, the following
    additional features are enabled (cf. &quot;$^P&quot; in perlvar):</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Perl inserts the contents of <span class="Li">$ENV{PERL5DB}</span> (or
      <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN {require</span>
      <span class="Li">'perl5db.pl'}&quot;</span> if not present) before the
      first line of your program.</li>
  <li>Each array
      <span class="Li">&quot;@{&quot;_&lt;$filename&quot;}&quot;</span> holds
      the lines of <span class="Li">$filename</span> for a file compiled by
      Perl. The same is also true for <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>ed
      strings that contain subroutines, or which are currently being executed.
      The <span class="Li">$filename</span> for
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>ed strings looks like
      <span class="Li">&quot;(eval 34)&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Values in this array are magical in numeric context: they
        compare equal to zero only if the line is not breakable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Each hash
      <span class="Li">&quot;%{&quot;_&lt;$filename&quot;}&quot;</span> contains
      breakpoints and actions keyed by line number. Individual entries (as
      opposed to the whole hash) are settable. Perl only cares about Boolean
      true here, although the values used by <i>perl5db.pl</i> have the form
      <span class="Li">&quot;$break_condition\0$action&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">The same holds for evaluated strings that contain subroutines,
        or which are currently being executed. The
        <span class="Li">$filename</span> for
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>ed strings looks like
        <span class="Li">&quot;(eval 34)&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Each scalar
      <span class="Li">&quot;${&quot;_&lt;$filename&quot;}&quot;</span> contains
      <span class="Li">&quot;_&lt;$filename&quot;</span>. This is also the case
      for evaluated strings that contain subroutines, or which are currently
      being executed. The <span class="Li">$filename</span> for
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>ed strings looks like
      <span class="Li">&quot;(eval 34)&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>After each <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>d file is compiled,
      but before it is executed,
      <span class="Li">&quot;DB::postponed(*{&quot;_&lt;$filename&quot;})&quot;</span>
      is called if the subroutine
      <span class="Li">&quot;DB::postponed&quot;</span> exists. Here, the
      <span class="Li">$filename</span> is the expanded name of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>d file, as found in the values
      of <span class="Li">%INC</span>.</li>
  <li>After each subroutine <span class="Li">&quot;subname&quot;</span> is
      compiled, the existence of <span class="Li">$DB::postponed{subname}</span>
      is checked. If this key exists,
      <span class="Li">&quot;DB::postponed(subname)&quot;</span> is called if
      the <span class="Li">&quot;DB::postponed&quot;</span> subroutine also
      exists.</li>
  <li>A hash <span class="Li">%DB::sub</span> is maintained, whose keys are
      subroutine names and whose values have the form
      <span class="Li">&quot;filename:startline-endline&quot;</span>.
      <span class="Li">&quot;filename&quot;</span> has the form
      <span class="Li">&quot;(eval 34)&quot;</span> for subroutines defined
      inside <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>s.</li>
  <li>When the execution of your program reaches a point that can hold a
      breakpoint, the <span class="Li">&quot;DB::DB()&quot;</span> subroutine is
      called if any of the variables <span class="Li">$DB::trace</span>,
      <span class="Li">$DB::single</span>, or
      <span class="Li">$DB::signal</span> is true. These variables are not
      <span class="Li">&quot;local&quot;</span>izable. This feature is disabled
      when executing inside <span class="Li">&quot;DB::DB()&quot;</span>,
      including functions called from it unless <span class="Li">&quot;$^D &amp;
      (1&lt;&lt;30)&quot;</span> is true.</li>
  <li>When execution of the program reaches a subroutine call, a call to
      <span class="Li">&amp;DB::sub</span>(<i>args</i>) is made instead, with
      <span class="Li">$DB::sub</span> set to identify the called subroutine.
      (This doesn't happen if the calling subroutine was compiled in the
      <span class="Li">&quot;DB&quot;</span> package.)
      <span class="Li">$DB::sub</span> normally holds the name of the called
      subroutine, if it has a name by which it can be looked up. Failing that,
      <span class="Li">$DB::sub</span> will hold a reference to the called
      subroutine. Either way, the <span class="Li">&amp;DB::sub</span>
      subroutine can use <span class="Li">$DB::sub</span> as a reference by
      which to call the called subroutine, which it will normally want to do.
    <p class="Pp">If the call is to an lvalue subroutine, and
        <span class="Li">&amp;DB::lsub</span> is defined
        <span class="Li">&amp;DB::lsub</span>(<i>args</i>) is called instead,
        otherwise falling back to
        <span class="Li">&amp;DB::sub</span>(<i>args</i>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>When execution of the program uses
      <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span> to enter a non-XS subroutine and
      the 0x80 bit is set in <span class="Li">$^P</span>, a call to
      <span class="Li">&amp;DB::goto</span> is made, with
      <span class="Li">$DB::sub</span> set to identify the subroutine being
      entered. The call to <span class="Li">&amp;DB::goto</span> does not
      replace the <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>; the requested
      subroutine will still be entered once
      <span class="Li">&amp;DB::goto</span> has returned.
      <span class="Li">$DB::sub</span> normally holds the name of the subroutine
      being entered, if it has one. Failing that,
      <span class="Li">$DB::sub</span> will hold a reference to the subroutine
      being entered. Unlike when <span class="Li">&amp;DB::sub</span> is called,
      it is not guaranteed that <span class="Li">$DB::sub</span> can be used as
      a reference to operate on the subroutine being entered.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Note that if <span class="Li">&amp;DB::sub</span> needs external
    data for it to work, no subroutine call is possible without it. As an
    example, the standard debugger's <span class="Li">&amp;DB::sub</span>
    depends on the <span class="Li">$DB::deep</span> variable (it defines how
    many levels of recursion deep into the debugger you can go before a
    mandatory break). If <span class="Li">$DB::deep</span> is not defined,
    subroutine calls are not possible, even though
    <span class="Li">&amp;DB::sub</span> exists.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Writing_Your_Own_Debugger"><a class="permalink" href="#Writing_Your_Own_Debugger">Writing
  Your Own Debugger</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><i>Environment Variables</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;PERL5DB&quot;</span> environment
    variable can be used to define a debugger. For example, the minimal
    &quot;working&quot; debugger (it actually doesn't do anything) consists of
    one line:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  sub DB::DB {}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It can easily be defined like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  $ PERL5DB=&quot;sub DB::DB {}&quot; perl -d your-script
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Another brief debugger, slightly more useful, can be created with
    only the line:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  sub DB::DB {print ++$i; scalar &lt;STDIN&gt;}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This debugger prints a number which increments for each statement
    encountered and waits for you to hit a newline before continuing to the next
    statement.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following debugger is actually useful:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  {
    package DB;
    sub DB  {}
    sub sub {print ++$i, &quot; $sub\n&quot;; &amp;$sub}
  }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It prints the sequence number of each subroutine call and the name
    of the called subroutine. Note that <span class="Li">&amp;DB::sub</span> is
    being compiled into the package <span class="Li">&quot;DB&quot;</span>
    through the use of the <span class="Li">&quot;package&quot;</span>
    directive.</p>
<p class="Pp">When it starts, the debugger reads your rc file (<i>./.perldb</i>
    or <i>~/.perldb</i> under Unix), which can set important options. (A
    subroutine (<span class="Li">&amp;afterinit</span>) can be defined here as
    well; it is executed after the debugger completes its own
  initialization.)</p>
<p class="Pp">After the rc file is read, the debugger reads the PERLDB_OPTS
    environment variable and uses it to set debugger options. The contents of
    this variable are treated as if they were the argument of an
    <span class="Li">&quot;o ...&quot;</span> debugger command (q.v. in
    &quot;Configurable Options&quot; in perldebug).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Debugger Internal Variables</i></p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to the file and subroutine-related variables mentioned
    above, the debugger also maintains various magical internal variables.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">@DB::dbline</span> is an alias for
      <span class="Li">&quot;@{&quot;::_&lt;current_file&quot;}&quot;</span>,
      which holds the lines of the currently-selected file (compiled by Perl),
      either explicitly chosen with the debugger's
      <span class="Li">&quot;f&quot;</span> command, or implicitly by flow of
      execution.
    <p class="Pp">Values in this array are magical in numeric context: they
        compare equal to zero only if the line is not breakable.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">%DB::dbline</span> is an alias for
      <span class="Li">&quot;%{&quot;::_&lt;current_file&quot;}&quot;</span>,
      which contains breakpoints and actions keyed by line number in the
      currently-selected file, either explicitly chosen with the debugger's
      <span class="Li">&quot;f&quot;</span> command, or implicitly by flow of
      execution.
    <p class="Pp">As previously noted, individual entries (as opposed to the
        whole hash) are settable. Perl only cares about Boolean true here,
        although the values used by <i>perl5db.pl</i> have the form
        <span class="Li">&quot;$break_condition\0$action&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp"><i>Debugger Customization Functions</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Some functions are provided to simplify customization.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>See &quot;Configurable Options&quot; in perldebug for a description of
      options parsed by
      <span class="Li">&quot;DB::parse_options(string)&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;DB::dump_trace(skip[,count])&quot;</span> skips the
      specified number of frames and returns a list containing information about
      the calling frames (all of them, if
      <span class="Li">&quot;count&quot;</span> is missing). Each entry is
      reference to a hash with keys <span class="Li">&quot;context&quot;</span>
      (either <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span>),
      <span class="Li">&quot;sub&quot;</span> (subroutine name, or info about
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>),
      <span class="Li">&quot;args&quot;</span>
      (<span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> or a reference to an array),
      <span class="Li">&quot;file&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;line&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;DB::print_trace(FH, skip[, count[,
      short]])&quot;</span> prints formatted info about caller frames. The last
      two functions may be convenient as arguments to
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;</span> commands.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Note that any variables and functions that are not documented in
    this manpages (or in perldebug) are considered for internal use only, and as
    such are subject to change without notice.</p>

<p class="Pp">line (split into two lines above) contains optimizer information.
    In the example shown, the optimizer found that the match should contain a
    substring <span class="Li">&quot;de&quot;</span> at offset 1, plus substring
    <span class="Li">&quot;gh&quot;</span> at some offset between 3 and
    infinity. Moreover, when checking for these substrings (to abandon
    impossible matches quickly), Perl will check for the substring
    <span class="Li">&quot;gh&quot;</span> before checking for the substring
    <span class="Li">&quot;de&quot;</span>. The optimizer may also use the
    knowledge that the match starts (at the
    <span class="Li">&quot;first&quot;</span> <i>id</i>) with a character class,
    and no string shorter than 7 characters can possibly match.</p>

<p class="Pp">The optimizer-specific information is used to avoid entering (a

<h1 class="Sh" id="Debugging_Perl_Memory_Usage"><a class="permalink" href="#Debugging_Perl_Memory_Usage">Debugging
  Perl Memory Usage</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Perl is a profligate wastrel when it comes to memory use. There is
    a saying that to estimate memory usage of Perl, assume a reasonable
    algorithm for memory allocation, multiply that estimate by 10, and while you
    still may miss the mark, at least you won't be quite so astonished. This is
    not absolutely true, but may provide a good grasp of what happens.</p>
<p class="Pp">Assume that an integer cannot take less than 20 bytes of memory, a
    float cannot take less than 24 bytes, a string cannot take less than 32
    bytes (all these examples assume 32-bit architectures, the result are quite
    a bit worse on 64-bit architectures). If a variable is accessed in two of
    three different ways (which require an integer, a float, or a string), the
    memory footprint may increase yet another 20 bytes. A sloppy
    <b>malloc</b>(3) implementation can inflate these numbers dramatically.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the opposite end of the scale, a declaration like</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  sub foo;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">may take up to 500 bytes of memory, depending on which release of
    Perl you're running.</p>
<p class="Pp">Anecdotal estimates of source-to-compiled code bloat suggest an
    eightfold increase. This means that the compiled form of reasonable
    (normally commented, properly indented etc.) code will take about eight
    times more space in memory than the code took on disk.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-DL</b> command-line switch is obsolete since circa Perl
    5.6.0 (it was available only if Perl was built with
    <span class="Li">&quot;-DDEBUGGING&quot;</span>). The switch was used to
    track Perl's memory allocations and possible memory leaks. These days the
    use of malloc debugging tools like <i>Purify</i> or <i>valgrind</i> is
    suggested instead. See also &quot;PERL_MEM_LOG&quot; in perlhacktips.</p>
<p class="Pp">One way to find out how much memory is being used by Perl data
    structures is to install the Devel::Size module from CPAN: it gives you the
    minimum number of bytes required to store a particular data structure.
    Please be mindful of the difference between the <b>size()</b> and
    <b>total_size()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If Perl has been compiled using Perl's malloc you can analyze Perl
    memory usage by setting <span class="Li">$ENV</span>{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Using_$ENV_PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS_"><a class="permalink" href="#Using_$ENV_PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS_">Using
  $ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If your perl is using Perl's <b>malloc()</b> and was compiled with
    the necessary switches (this is the default), then it will print memory
    usage statistics after compiling your code when
    <span class="Li">&quot;$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS}</span> <span class="Li">&gt;
    1&quot;</span>, and before termination of the program when
    <span class="Li">&quot;$ENV{PERL_DEBUG_MSTATS} &gt;= 1&quot;</span>. The
    report format is similar to the following example:</p>

</pre>
<p class="Pp">It is possible to ask for such a statistic at arbitrary points in
    your execution using the <b>mstat()</b> function out of the standard
    Devel::Peek module.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is some explanation of that format:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;buckets SMALLEST(APPROX)..GREATEST(APPROX)&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Perl's <b>malloc()</b> uses bucketed allocations. Every request is rounded
      up to the closest bucket size available, and a bucket is taken from the
      pool of buckets of that size.
    <p class="Pp">The line above describes the limits of buckets currently in
        use. Each bucket has two sizes: memory footprint and the maximal size of
        user data that can fit into this bucket. Suppose in the above example
        that the smallest bucket were size 4. The biggest bucket would have
        usable size 8188, and the memory footprint would be 8192.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In a Perl built for debugging, some buckets may have negative
        usable size. This means that these buckets cannot (and will not) be
        used. For larger buckets, the memory footprint may be one page greater
        than a power of 2. If so, the corresponding power of two is printed in
        the <span class="Li">&quot;APPROX&quot;</span> field above.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Free/Used"><a class="permalink" href="#Free/Used">Free/Used</a></dt>
  <dd>The 1 or 2 rows of numbers following that correspond to the number of
      buckets of each size between <span class="Li">&quot;SMALLEST&quot;</span>
      and <span class="Li">&quot;GREATEST&quot;</span>. In the first row, the
      sizes (memory footprints) of buckets are powers of two--or possibly one
      page greater. In the second row, if present, the memory footprints of the
      buckets are between the memory footprints of two buckets
      &quot;above&quot;.
    <p class="Pp">For example, suppose under the previous example, the memory
        footprints were</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   free:    8     16    32    64    128  256 512 1024 2048 4096 8192
           4     12    24    48    80
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">With a non-<span class="Li">&quot;DEBUGGING&quot;</span> perl,
        the buckets starting from <span class="Li">128</span> have a 4-byte
        overhead, and thus an 8192-long bucket may take up to 8188-byte
        allocations.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;Total sbrk(): SBRKed/SBRKs:CONTINUOUS&quot;</dt>
  <dd>The first two fields give the total amount of memory perl <b>sbrk</b>(2)ed
      (ess-broken? :-) and number of <b>sbrk</b>(2)s used. The third number is
      what perl thinks about continuity of returned chunks. So long as this
      number is positive, <b>malloc()</b> will assume that it is probable that
      <b>sbrk</b>(2) will provide continuous memory.
    <p class="Pp">Memory allocated by external libraries is not counted.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;pad: 0&quot;</dt>
  <dd>The amount of <b>sbrk</b>(2)ed memory needed to keep buckets aligned.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;heads: 2192&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Although memory overhead of bigger buckets is kept inside the bucket, for
      smaller buckets, it is kept in separate areas. This field gives the total
      size of these areas.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;chain: 0&quot;</dt>
  <dd><b>malloc()</b> may want to subdivide a bigger bucket into smaller
      buckets. If only a part of the deceased bucket is left unsubdivided, the
      rest is kept as an element of a linked list. This field gives the total
      size of these chunks.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;tail: 6144&quot;</dt>
  <dd>To minimize the number of <b>sbrk</b>(2)s, <b>malloc()</b> asks for more
      memory. This field gives the size of the yet unused part, which is
      <b>sbrk</b>(2)ed, but never touched.</dd>
