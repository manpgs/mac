<h2 class="Ss" id="Should_I_use_a_web_framework?"><a class="permalink" href="#Should_I_use_a_web_framework?">Should
  I use a web framework?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Yes. If you are building a web site with any level of
    interactivity (forms / users / databases), you will want to use a framework
    to make handling requests and responses easier.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there is no interactivity then you may still want to look at
    using something like Template Toolkit
    &lt;https://metacpan.org/module/Template&gt; or
    Plack::Middleware::TemplateToolkit so maintenance of your HTML files (and
    other assets) is easier.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Which_web_framework_should_I_use?"><a class="permalink" href="#Which_web_framework_should_I_use?">Which
  web framework should I use?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There is no simple answer to this question. Perl frameworks can
    run everything from basic file servers and small scale intranets to massive
    multinational multilingual websites that are the core to international
    businesses.</p>
<p class="Pp">Below is a list of a few frameworks with comments which might help
    you in making a decision, depending on your specific requirements. Start by
    reading the docs, then ask questions on the relevant mailing list or IRC
    channel.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Catalyst"><a class="permalink" href="#Catalyst">Catalyst</a></dt>
  <dd>Strongly object-oriented and fully-featured with a long development
      history and a large community and addon ecosystem. It is excellent for
      large and complex applications, where you have full control over the
      server.</dd>
  <dt id="Dancer2"><a class="permalink" href="#Dancer2">Dancer2</a></dt>
  <dd>Free of legacy weight, providing a lightweight and easy to learn API. Has
      a growing addon ecosystem. It is best used for smaller projects and very
      easy to learn for beginners.</dd>
  <dt id="Mojolicious"><a class="permalink" href="#Mojolicious">Mojolicious</a></dt>
  <dd>Self-contained and powerful for both small and larger projects, with a
      focus on HTML5 and real-time web technologies such as WebSockets.</dd>
  <dt id="Web::Simple"><a class="permalink" href="#Web::Simple">Web::Simple</a></dt>
  <dd>Strongly object-oriented and minimal, built for speed and intended as a
      toolkit for building micro web apps, custom frameworks or for tieing
      together existing Plack-compatible web applications with one central
      dispatcher.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">All of these interact with or use Plack which is worth
    understanding the basics of when building a website in Perl (there is a lot
    of useful Plack::Middleware
    &lt;https://metacpan.org/search?q=plack%3A%3Amiddleware&gt;).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is_Plack_and_"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is_Plack_and_">What
  is Plack and PSGI?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">PSGI is the Perl Web Server Gateway Interface Specification, it is
    a standard that many Perl web frameworks use, you should not need to
    understand it to build a web site, the part you might want to use is
  Plack.</p>
<p class="Pp">Plack is a set of tools for using the PSGI stack. It contains
    middleware &lt;https://metacpan.org/search?q=plack%3A%3Amiddleware&gt;
    components, a reference server and utilities for Web application frameworks.
    Plack is like Ruby's Rack or Python's Paste for WSGI.</p>
<p class="Pp">You could build a web site using Plack and your own code, but for
    anything other than a very basic web site, using a web framework (that uses
    &lt;https://plackperl.org&gt;) is a better option.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_do_I_remove_"><a class="permalink" href="#How_do_I_remove_">How
  do I remove HTML from a string?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Use HTML::Strip, or HTML::FormatText which not only removes HTML
    but also attempts to do a little simple formatting of the resulting plain
    text.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="How_do_I_extract_URLs?"><a class="permalink" href="#How_do_I_extract_URLs?">How
  do I extract URLs?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">HTML::SimpleLinkExtor will extract URLs from HTML, it handles
    anchors, images, objects, frames, and many other tags that can contain a
    URL. If you need anything more complex, you can create your own subclass of
    HTML::LinkExtor or HTML::Parser. You might even use HTML::SimpleLinkExtor as
    an example for something specifically suited to your needs.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can use URI::Find or URL::Search to extract URLs from an
    arbitrary text document.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="How_do_I_fetch_an_"><a class="permalink" href="#How_do_I_fetch_an_">How
  do I fetch an HTML file?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">(contributed by brian d foy)</p>
<p class="Pp">The core HTTP::Tiny module can fetch web resources and give their
    content back to you as a string:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use HTTP::Tiny;
    my $ua = HTTP::Tiny-&gt;new;
    my $html = $ua-&gt;get( &quot;http://www.example.com/index.html&quot; )-&gt;{content};
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It can also store the resource directly in a file:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $ua-&gt;mirror( &quot;http://www.example.com/index.html&quot;, &quot;foo.html&quot; );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you need to do something more complicated, the HTTP::Tiny
    object can be customized by setting attributes, or you can use
    LWP::UserAgent from the libwww-perl distribution or Mojo::UserAgent from the
    Mojolicious distribution to make common tasks easier. If you want to
    simulate an interactive web browser, you can use the WWW::Mechanize
  module.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="How_do_I_automate_an_"><a class="permalink" href="#How_do_I_automate_an_">How
  do I automate an HTML form submission?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If you are doing something complex, such as moving through many
    pages and forms or a web site, you can use WWW::Mechanize. See its
    documentation for all the details.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you're submitting values using the GET method, create a URL and
    encode the form using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;www_form_urlencode&quot;</span> method from
    HTTP::Tiny:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use HTTP::Tiny;
    my $ua = HTTP::Tiny-&gt;new;
    my $query = $ua-&gt;www_form_urlencode([ q =&gt; 'DB_File', lucky =&gt; 1 ]);
    my $url = &quot;https://metacpan.org/search?$query&quot;;
    my $content = $ua-&gt;get($url)-&gt;{content};
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you're using the POST method, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;post_form&quot;</span> method will encode the content
    appropriately.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use HTTP::Tiny;
    my $ua = HTTP::Tiny-&gt;new;
    my $url = 'https://metacpan.org/search';
    my $form = [ q =&gt; 'DB_File', lucky =&gt; 1 ];
    my $content = $ua-&gt;post_form($url, $form)-&gt;{content};
</pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_do_I_decode_or_create_those__"><a class="permalink" href="#How_do_I_decode_or_create_those__">How
  do I decode or create those %-encodings on the web?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Most of the time you should not need to do this as your web
    framework, or if you are making a request, the LWP or other module would
    handle it for you.</p>
<p class="Pp">To encode a string yourself, use the URI::Escape module. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;uri_escape&quot;</span> function returns the escaped
    string:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $original = &quot;Colon : Hash # Percent %&quot;;
    my $escaped = uri_escape( $original );
    print &quot;$escaped\n&quot;; # 'Colon%20%3A%20Hash%20%23%20Percent%20%25'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To decode the string, use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;uri_unescape&quot;</span> function:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $unescaped = uri_unescape( $escaped );
    print $unescaped; # back to original
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Remember not to encode a full URI, you need to escape each
    component separately and then join them together.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_do_I_redirect_to_another_page?"><a class="permalink" href="#How_do_I_redirect_to_another_page?">How
  do I redirect to another page?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Most Perl Web Frameworks will have a mechanism for doing this,
    using the Catalyst framework it would be:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $c-&gt;res-&gt;redirect($url);
    $c-&gt;detach();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you are using Plack (which most frameworks do), then
    Plack::Middleware::Rewrite is worth looking at if you are migrating from
    Apache or have URL's you want to always redirect.</p>

  do I put a password on my web pages?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">See if the web framework you are using has an authentication
    system and if that fits your needs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternativly look at Plack::Middleware::Auth::Basic, or one of the
    other Plack authentication &lt;https://metacpan.org/search?q=plack+auth&gt;
    options.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_do_I_make_sure_users_can't_enter_values_into_a_form_that_causes_my_"><a class="permalink" href="#How_do_I_make_sure_users_can't_enter_values_into_a_form_that_causes_my_">How
  do I make sure users can't enter values into a form that causes my CGI script
  to do bad things?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">(contributed by brian d foy)</p>
<p class="Pp">You can't prevent people from sending your script bad data. Even
    if you add some client-side checks, people may disable them or bypass them
    completely. For instance, someone might use a module such as LWP to submit
    to your web site. If you want to prevent data that try to use SQL injection
    or other sorts of attacks (and you should want to), you have to not trust
    any data that enter your program.</p>
<p class="Pp">The perlsec documentation has general advice about data security.
    If you are using the DBI module, use placeholder to fill in data. If you are
    running external programs with <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span>, use the list forms. There are many
    other precautions that you should take, too many to list here, and most of
    them fall under the category of not using any data that you don't intend to
    use. Trust no one.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_do_I_parse_a_mail_header?"><a class="permalink" href="#How_do_I_parse_a_mail_header?">How
  do I parse a mail header?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Use the Email::MIME module. It's well-tested and supports all the
    craziness that you'll see in the real world (comment-folding whitespace,
    encodings, comments, etc.).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  use Email::MIME;
  my $message = Email::MIME-&gt;new($rfc2822);
  my $subject = $message-&gt;header('Subject');
  my $from    = $message-&gt;header('From');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you've already got some other kind of email object, consider
    passing it to Email::Abstract and then using its cast method to get an
    Email::MIME object:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my $abstract = Email::Abstract-&gt;new($mail_message_object);
  my $email_mime_object = $abstract-&gt;cast('Email::MIME');
</pre>

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_do_I_check_a_valid_mail_address?"><a class="permalink" href="#How_do_I_check_a_valid_mail_address?">How
  do I check a valid mail address?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">(partly contributed by Aaron Sherman)</p>
<p class="Pp">This isn't as simple a question as it sounds. There are two
  parts:</p>
<p class="Pp">a) How do I verify that an email address is correctly
  formatted?</p>
<p class="Pp">b) How do I verify that an email address targets a valid
    recipient?</p>
<p class="Pp">Without sending mail to the address and seeing whether there's a
    human on the other end to answer you, you cannot fully answer part <i>b</i>,
    but the Email::Valid module will do both part <i>a</i> and part <i>b</i> as
    far as you can in real-time.</p>
<p class="Pp">Our best advice for verifying a person's mail address is to have
    them enter their address twice, just as you normally do to change a
    password. This usually weeds out typos. If both versions match, send mail to
    that address with a personal message. If you get the message back and
    they've followed your directions, you can be reasonably assured that it's
    real.</p>
<p class="Pp">A related strategy that's less open to forgery is to give them a
    PIN (personal ID number). Record the address and PIN (best that it be a
    random one) for later processing. In the mail you send, include a link to
    your site with the PIN included. If the mail bounces, you know it's not
    valid. If they don't click on the link, either they forged the address or
    (assuming they got the message) following through wasn't important so you
    don't need to worry about it.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_do_I_decode_a_"><a class="permalink" href="#How_do_I_decode_a_">How
  do I decode a MIME/BASE64 string?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The MIME::Base64 package handles this as well as the MIME/QP
    encoding. Decoding base 64 becomes as simple as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use MIME::Base64;
    my $decoded = decode_base64($encoded);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The Email::MIME module can decode base 64-encoded email message
    parts transparently so the developer doesn't need to worry about it.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_do_I_find_the_user's_mail_address?"><a class="permalink" href="#How_do_I_find_the_user's_mail_address?">How
  do I find the user's mail address?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Ask them for it. There are so many email providers available that
    it's unlikely the local system has any idea how to determine a user's email
    address.</p>
<p class="Pp">The exception is for organization-specific email (e.g.
    foo@yourcompany.com) where policy can be codified in your program. In that
    case, you could look at <span class="Li">$ENV</span>{USER},
    <span class="Li">$ENV</span>{LOGNAME}, and getpwuid($&lt;) in scalar
    context, like so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my $user_name = getpwuid($&lt;)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But you still cannot make assumptions about whether this is
    correct, unless your policy says it is. You really are best off asking the
    user.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_do_I_send_email?"><a class="permalink" href="#How_do_I_send_email?">How

<p class="Pp">Use the Email::Stuffer module, like so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  # first, create your message
  my $message = Email::Stuffer-&gt;from('you@example.com')
                              -&gt;to('friend@example.com')
                              -&gt;subject('Happy birthday!')
                              -&gt;text_body(&quot;Happy birthday to you!\n&quot;);
  $message-&gt;send_or_die;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">By default, Email::Sender::Simple (the
    <span class="Li">&quot;send&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;send_or_die&quot;</span> methods use this under the
    hood) will try <span class="Li">&quot;sendmail&quot;</span> first, if it
    exists in your <span class="Li">$PATH</span>. This generally isn't the case.
    If there's a remote mail server you use to send mail, consider investigating
    one of the Transport classes. At time of writing, the available transports
    include:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Email::Sender::Transport::Sendmail"><a class="permalink" href="#Email::Sender::Transport::Sendmail">Email::Sender::Transport::Sendmail</a></dt>
  <dd>This is the default. If you can use the <b>mail</b>(1) or <b>mailx</b>(1)
      program to send mail from the machine where your code runs, you should be
      able to use this.</dd>
  <dt id="Email::Sender::Transport::SMTP"><a class="permalink" href="#Email::Sender::Transport::SMTP">Email::Sender::Transport::SMTP</a></dt>
  <dd>This transport contacts a remote SMTP server over TCP. It optionally uses
      TLS or SSL and can authenticate to the server via SASL.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Telling Email::Stuffer to use your transport is
  straightforward.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $message-&gt;transport($email_sender_transport_object)-&gt;send_or_die;

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_do_I_use_"><a class="permalink" href="#How_do_I_use_">How

<p class="Pp">Email::MIME directly supports multipart messages. Email::MIME
    objects themselves are parts and can be attached to other Email::MIME
    objects. Consult the Email::MIME documentation for more information,
    including all of the supported methods and examples of their use.</p>
<p class="Pp">Email::Stuffer uses Email::MIME under the hood to construct
    messages, and wraps the most common attachment tasks with the simple
    <span class="Li">&quot;attach&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;attach_file&quot;</span> methods.</p>
