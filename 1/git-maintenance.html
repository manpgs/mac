<p class="Pp">Run tasks to optimize Git repository data, speeding up other Git
    commands and reducing storage requirements for the repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">Git commands that add repository data, such as <b>git add</b> or
    <b>git fetch</b>, are optimized for a responsive user experience. These
    commands do not take time to optimize the Git data, since such optimizations
    scale with the full size of the repository while these user commands each
    perform a relatively small action.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>git maintenance</b> command provides flexibility for how to
    optimize the Git repository.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SUBCOMMANDS"><a class="permalink" href="#SUBCOMMANDS">SUBCOMMANDS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">run</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Run one or more maintenance tasks. If one or more
  <b>--task</b> options are specified, then those tasks are run in that order.
  Otherwise, the tasks are determined by which
  <b>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.enabled</b> config options are true. By default,
  only <b>maintenance.gc.enabled</b> is true.</div>
<p class="Pp">start</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Start running maintenance on the current repository. This
  performs the same config updates as the <b>register</b> subcommand, then
  updates the background scheduler to run <b>git maintenance run --scheduled</b>
  on an hourly basis.</div>
<p class="Pp">stop</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Halt the background maintenance schedule. The current
  repository is not removed from the list of maintained repositories, in case
  the background maintenance is restarted later.</div>
<p class="Pp">register</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Initialize Git config values so any scheduled maintenance
  will start running on this repository. This adds the repository to the
  <b>maintenance.repo</b> config variable in the current user&#x2019;s global
  config, or the config specified by --config-file option, and enables some
  recommended configuration values for <b>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.schedule</b>.
  The tasks that are enabled are safe for running in the background without
  disrupting foreground processes.
<p class="Pp">The <b>register</b> subcommand will also set the
    <b>maintenance.strategy</b> config value to <b>incremental</b>, if this
    value is not previously set. The <b>incremental</b> strategy uses the
    following schedule for each maintenance task:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>gc</b>: disabled.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>commit-graph</b>: hourly.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>prefetch</b>: hourly.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>loose-objects</b>: daily.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>incremental-repack</b>: daily.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git maintenance register</b> will also disable foreground
    maintenance by setting <b>maintenance.auto = false</b> in the current
    repository. This config setting will remain after a <b>git maintenance
    unregister</b> command.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">unregister</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Remove the current repository from background
  maintenance. This only removes the repository from the configured list. It
  does not stop the background maintenance processes from running.
<p class="Pp">The <b>unregister</b> subcommand will report an error if the
    current repository is not already registered. Use the <b>--force</b> option
    to return success even when the current repository is not registered.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TASKS"><a class="permalink" href="#TASKS">TASKS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">commit-graph</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>commit-graph</b> job updates the
  <b>commit-graph</b> files incrementally, then verifies that the written data
  is correct. The incremental write is safe to run alongside concurrent Git
  processes since it will not expire <b>.graph</b> files that were in the
  previous <b>commit-graph-chain</b> file. They will be deleted by a later run
  based on the expiration delay.</div>
<p class="Pp">prefetch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>prefetch</b> task updates the object directory
  with the latest objects from all registered remotes. For each remote, a <b>git
  fetch</b> command is run. The configured refspec is modified to place all
  requested refs within <b>refs/prefetch/</b>. Also, tags are not updated.
<p class="Pp">This is done to avoid disrupting the remote-tracking branches. The
    end users expect these refs to stay unmoved unless they initiate a fetch.
    With prefetch task, however, the objects necessary to complete a later real
    fetch would already be obtained, so the real fetch would go faster. In the
    ideal case, it will just become an update to a bunch of remote-tracking
    branches without any object transfer.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Clean up unnecessary files and optimize the local
  repository. &quot;GC&quot; stands for &quot;garbage collection,&quot; but this
  task performs many smaller tasks. This task can be expensive for large
  repositories, as it repacks all Git objects into a single pack-file. It can
  also be disruptive in some situations, as it deletes stale data. See
  <b>git-gc</b>(1) for more details on garbage collection in Git.</div>
<p class="Pp">loose-objects</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>loose-objects</b> job cleans up loose objects and
  places them into pack-files. In order to prevent race conditions with
  concurrent Git commands, it follows a two-step process. First, it deletes any
  loose objects that already exist in a pack-file; concurrent Git processes will
  examine the pack-file for the object data instead of the loose object. Second,
  it creates a new pack-file (starting with &quot;loose-&quot;) containing a
  batch of loose objects. The batch size is limited to 50 thousand objects to
  prevent the job from taking too long on a repository with many loose objects.
  The <b>gc</b> task writes unreachable objects as loose objects to be cleaned
  up by a later step only if they are not re-added to a pack-file; for this
  reason it is not advisable to enable both the <b>loose-objects</b> and
  <b>gc</b> tasks at the same time.</div>
<p class="Pp">incremental-repack</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>incremental-repack</b> job repacks the object
  directory using the <b>multi-pack-index</b> feature. In order to prevent race
  conditions with concurrent Git commands, it follows a two-step process. First,
  it calls <b>git multi-pack-index expire</b> to delete pack-files unreferenced
  by the <b>multi-pack-index</b> file. Second, it calls <b>git multi-pack-index
  repack</b> to select several small pack-files and repack them into a bigger
  one, and then update the <b>multi-pack-index</b> entries that refer to the
  small pack-files to refer to the new pack-file. This prepares those small
  pack-files for deletion upon the next run of <b>git multi-pack-index
  expire</b>. The selection of the small pack-files is such that the expected
  size of the big pack-file is at least the batch size; see the
  <b>--batch-size</b> option for the <b>repack</b> subcommand in
  <b>git-multi-pack-index</b>(1). The default batch-size is zero, which is a
  special case that attempts to repack all pack-files into a single
  pack-file.</div>
<p class="Pp">pack-refs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>pack-refs</b> task collects the loose reference
  files and collects them into a single file. This speeds up operations that
  need to iterate across many references. See <b>git-pack-refs</b>(1) for more
  information.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">--auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When combined with the <b>run</b> subcommand, run
  maintenance tasks only if certain thresholds are met. For example, the
  <b>gc</b> task runs when the number of loose objects exceeds the number stored
  in the <b>gc.auto</b> config setting, or when the number of pack-files exceeds
  the <b>gc.autoPackLimit</b> config setting. Not compatible with the
  <b>--schedule</b> option.</div>
<p class="Pp">--schedule</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When combined with the <b>run</b> subcommand, run
  maintenance tasks only if certain time conditions are met, as specified by the
  <b>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.schedule</b> config value for each
  <b>&lt;task&gt;</b>. This config value specifies a number of seconds since the
  last time that task ran, according to the
  <b>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.lastRun</b> config value. The tasks that are
  tested are those provided by the <b>--task=&lt;task&gt;</b> option(s) or those
  with <b>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.enabled</b> set to true.</div>
<p class="Pp">--quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not report progress or other information over
  <b>stderr</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--task=&lt;task&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If this option is specified one or more times, then only
  run the specified tasks in the specified order. If no
  <b>--task=&lt;task&gt;</b> arguments are specified, then only the tasks with
  <b>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.enabled</b> configured as <b>true</b> are
  considered. See the <i>TASKS</i> section for the list of accepted
  <b>&lt;task&gt;</b> values.</div>
<p class="Pp">--scheduler=auto|crontab|systemd-timer|launchctl|schtasks</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When combined with the <b>start</b> subcommand, specify
  the scheduler for running the hourly, daily and weekly executions of <b>git
  maintenance run</b>. Possible values for <b>&lt;scheduler&gt;</b> are
  <b>auto</b>, <b>crontab</b> (POSIX), <b>systemd-timer</b> (Linux),
  <b>launchctl</b> (macOS), and <b>schtasks</b> (Windows). When <b>auto</b> is
  specified, the appropriate platform-specific scheduler is used; on Linux,
  <b>systemd-timer</b> is used if available, otherwise <b>crontab</b>. Default
  is <b>auto</b>.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="TROUBLESHOOTING"><a class="permalink" href="#TROUBLESHOOTING">TROUBLESHOOTING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>git maintenance</b> command is designed to simplify the
    repository maintenance patterns while minimizing user wait time during Git
    commands. A variety of configuration options are available to allow
    customizing this process. The default maintenance options focus on
    operations that complete quickly, even on large repositories.</p>
<p class="Pp">Users may find some cases where scheduled maintenance tasks do not
    run as frequently as intended. Each <b>git maintenance run</b> command takes
    a lock on the repository&#x2019;s object database, and this prevents other
    concurrent <b>git maintenance run</b> commands from running on the same
    repository. Without this safeguard, competing processes could leave the
    repository in an unpredictable state.</p>
<p class="Pp">The background maintenance schedule runs <b>git maintenance
    run</b> processes on an hourly basis. Each run executes the
    &quot;hourly&quot; tasks. At midnight, that process also executes the
    &quot;daily&quot; tasks. At midnight on the first day of the week, that
    process also executes the &quot;weekly&quot; tasks. A single process
    iterates over each registered repository, performing the scheduled tasks for
    that frequency. Depending on the number of registered repositories and their
    sizes, this process may take longer than an hour. In this case, multiple
    <b>git maintenance run</b> commands may run on the same repository at the
    same time, colliding on the object database lock. This results in one of the
    two tasks not running.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you find that some maintenance windows are taking longer than
    one hour to complete, then consider reducing the complexity of your
    maintenance tasks. For example, the <b>gc</b> task is much slower than the
    <b>incremental-repack</b> task. However, this comes at a cost of a slightly
    larger object database. Consider moving more expensive tasks to be run less
    frequently.</p>
<p class="Pp">Expert users may consider scheduling their own maintenance tasks
    using a different schedule than is available through <b>git maintenance
    start</b> and Git configuration options. These users should be aware of the
    object database lock and how concurrent <b>git maintenance run</b> commands
    behave. Further, the <b>git gc</b> command should not be combined with
    <b>git maintenance run</b> commands. <b>git gc</b> modifies the object
    database but does not take the lock in the same way as <b>git maintenance
    run</b>. If possible, use <b>git maintenance run --task=gc</b> instead of
    <b>git gc</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following sections describe the mechanisms put in place to run
    background maintenance by <b>git maintenance start</b> and how to customize
    them.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="BACKGROUND_MAINTENANCE_ON_POSIX_SYSTEMS"><a class="permalink" href="#BACKGROUND_MAINTENANCE_ON_POSIX_SYSTEMS">BACKGROUND
  MAINTENANCE ON POSIX SYSTEMS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The standard mechanism for scheduling background tasks on POSIX
    systems is cron(8). This tool executes commands based on a given schedule.
    The current list of user-scheduled tasks can be found by running <b>crontab
    -l</b>. The schedule written by <b>git maintenance start</b> is similar to
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre># BEGIN GIT MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE
# The following schedule was created by Git
# Any edits made in this region might be
# replaced in the future by a Git command.
0 1-23 * * * &quot;/&lt;path&gt;/git&quot; --exec-path=&quot;/&lt;path&gt;&quot; for-each-repo --config=maintenance.repo maintenance run --schedule=hourly
0 0 * * 1-6 &quot;/&lt;path&gt;/git&quot; --exec-path=&quot;/&lt;path&gt;&quot; for-each-repo --config=maintenance.repo maintenance run --schedule=daily
0 0 * * 0 &quot;/&lt;path&gt;/git&quot; --exec-path=&quot;/&lt;path&gt;&quot; for-each-repo --config=maintenance.repo maintenance run --schedule=weekly
# END GIT MAINTENANCE SCHEDULE</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The comments are used as a region to mark the schedule as written
    by Git. Any modifications within this region will be completely deleted by
    <b>git maintenance stop</b> or overwritten by <b>git maintenance
  start</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>crontab</b> entry specifies the full path of the <b>git</b>
    executable to ensure that the executed <b>git</b> command is the same one
    with which <b>git maintenance start</b> was issued independent of
    <b>PATH</b>. If the same user runs <b>git maintenance start</b> with
    multiple Git executables, then only the latest executable is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">These commands use <b>git for-each-repo
    --config=maintenance.repo</b> to run <b>git maintenance run
    --schedule=&lt;frequency&gt;</b> on each repository listed in the
    multi-valued <b>maintenance.repo</b> config option. These are typically
    loaded from the user-specific global config. The <b>git maintenance</b>
    process then determines which maintenance tasks are configured to run on
    each repository with each <b>&lt;frequency&gt;</b> using the
    <b>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.schedule</b> config options. These values are
    loaded from the global or repository config values.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the config values are insufficient to achieve your desired
    background maintenance schedule, then you can create your own schedule. If
    you run <b>crontab -e</b>, then an editor will load with your user-specific
    <b>cron</b> schedule. In that editor, you can add your own schedule lines.
    You could start by adapting the default schedule listed earlier, or you
    could read the crontab(5) documentation for advanced scheduling techniques.
    Please do use the full path and <b>--exec-path</b> techniques from the
    default schedule to ensure you are executing the correct binaries in your
    schedule.</p>

  MAINTENANCE ON LINUX SYSTEMD SYSTEMS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">While Linux supports <b>cron</b>, depending on the distribution,
    <b>cron</b> may be an optional package not necessarily installed. On modern
    Linux distributions, systemd timers are superseding it.</p>
<p class="Pp">If user systemd timers are available, they will be used as a
    replacement of <b>cron</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In this case, <b>git maintenance start</b> will create user
    systemd timer units and start the timers. The current list of user-scheduled
    tasks can be found by running <b>systemctl --user list-timers</b>. The
    timers written by <b>git maintenance start</b> are similar to this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ systemctl --user list-timers

</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">One timer is registered for each
    <b>--schedule=&lt;frequency&gt;</b> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">The definition of the systemd units can be inspected in the
    following files:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>~/.config/systemd/user/git-maintenance@.timer
~/.config/systemd/user/git-maintenance@.service
~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/git-maintenance@hourly.timer
~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/git-maintenance@daily.timer
~/.config/systemd/user/timers.target.wants/git-maintenance@weekly.timer</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git maintenance start</b> will overwrite these files and start
    the timer again with <b>systemctl --user</b>, so any customization should be
    done by creating a drop-in file, i.e. a <b>.conf</b> suffixed file in the
    <b>~/.config/systemd/user/git-maintenance@.service.d</b> directory.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git maintenance stop</b> will stop the user systemd timers and
    delete the above mentioned files.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more details, see <b>systemd.timer(5)</b>.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="BACKGROUND_MAINTENANCE_ON_MACOS_SYSTEMS"><a class="permalink" href="#BACKGROUND_MAINTENANCE_ON_MACOS_SYSTEMS">BACKGROUND
  MAINTENANCE ON MACOS SYSTEMS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">While macOS technically supports <b>cron</b>, using <b>crontab
    -e</b> requires elevated privileges and the executed process does not have a
    full user context. Without a full user context, Git and its credential
    helpers cannot access stored credentials, so some maintenance tasks are not
    functional.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead, <b>git maintenance start</b> interacts with the
    <b>launchctl</b> tool, which is the recommended way to schedule timed jobs
    in macOS. Scheduling maintenance through <b>git maintenance (start|stop)</b>
    requires some <b>launchctl</b> features available only in macOS 10.11 or
    later.</p>
<p class="Pp">Your user-specific scheduled tasks are stored as XML-formatted
    <b>.plist</b> files in <b>~/Library/LaunchAgents/</b>. You can see the
    currently-registered tasks using the following command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ ls ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.git-scm.git*
org.git-scm.git.daily.plist
org.git-scm.git.hourly.plist
org.git-scm.git.weekly.plist</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">One task is registered for each
    <b>--schedule=&lt;frequency&gt;</b> option. To inspect how the XML format
    describes each schedule, open one of these <b>.plist</b> files in an editor
    and inspect the <b>&lt;array&gt;</b> element following the
    <b>&lt;key&gt;StartCalendarInterval&lt;/key&gt;</b> element.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>git maintenance start</b> will overwrite these files and
    register the tasks again with <b>launchctl</b>, so any customizations should
    be done by creating your own <b>.plist</b> files with distinct names.
    Similarly, the <b>git maintenance stop</b> command will unregister the tasks
    with <b>launchctl</b> and delete the <b>.plist</b> files.</p>
<p class="Pp">To create more advanced customizations to your background tasks,
    see launchctl.plist(5) for more information.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BACKGROUND_MAINTENANCE_ON_WINDOWS_SYSTEMS"><a class="permalink" href="#BACKGROUND_MAINTENANCE_ON_WINDOWS_SYSTEMS">BACKGROUND
  MAINTENANCE ON WINDOWS SYSTEMS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Windows does not support <b>cron</b> and instead has its own
    system for scheduling background tasks. The <b>git maintenance start</b>
    command uses the <b>schtasks</b> command to submit tasks to this system. You
    can inspect all background tasks using the Task Scheduler application. The
    tasks added by Git have names of the form <b>Git Maintenance
    (&lt;frequency&gt;)</b>. The Task Scheduler GUI has ways to inspect these
    tasks, but you can also export the tasks to XML files and view the details
    there.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that since Git is a console application, these background
    tasks create a console window visible to the current user. This can be
    changed manually by selecting the &quot;Run whether user is logged in or
    not&quot; option in Task Scheduler. This change requires a password input,
    which is why <b>git maintenance start</b> does not select it by default.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to customize the background tasks, please rename the
    tasks so future calls to <b>git maintenance (start|stop)</b> do not
    overwrite your custom tasks.</p>
