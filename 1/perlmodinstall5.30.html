<p class="Pp">perlmodinstall - Installing CPAN Modules</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">You can think of a module as the fundamental unit of reusable Perl
    code; see perlmod for details. Whenever anyone creates a chunk of Perl code
    that they think will be useful to the world, they register as a Perl
    developer at &lt;http://www.cpan.org/modules/04pause.html&gt; so that they
    can then upload their code to the CPAN. The CPAN is the Comprehensive Perl
    Archive Network and can be accessed at &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt; , and
    searched at &lt;http://search.cpan.org/&gt; .</p>
<p class="Pp">This documentation is for people who want to download CPAN modules
    and install them on their own computer.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PREAMBLE</h2>
<p class="Pp">First, are you sure that the module isn't already on your system?
    Try <span class="Li">&quot;perl -MFoo -e 1&quot;</span>. (Replace
    &quot;Foo&quot; with the name of the module; for instance,
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -MCGI::Carp -e 1&quot;</span>.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If you don't see an error message, you have the module. (If you do
    see an error message, it's still possible you have the module, but that it's
    not in your path, which you can display with <span class="Li">&quot;perl
    -e</span> <span class="Li">&quot;print qq(@INC)&quot;&quot;</span>.) For the
    remainder of this document, we'll assume that you really honestly truly lack
    an installed module, but have found it on the CPAN.</p>
<p class="Pp">So now you have a file ending in .tar.gz (or, less often, .zip).
    You know there's a tasty module inside. There are four steps you must now
    take:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="DECOMPRESS"><a class="permalink" href="#DECOMPRESS"><b>DECOMPRESS</b>
    the file</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="UNPACK"><a class="permalink" href="#UNPACK"><b>UNPACK</b> the file
    into a directory</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="BUILD"><a class="permalink" href="#BUILD"><b>BUILD</b> the module
    (sometimes unnecessary)</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="INSTALL"><a class="permalink" href="#INSTALL"><b>INSTALL</b> the
    module.</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Here's how to perform each step for each operating system. This is
    &lt;not&gt; a substitute for reading the README and INSTALL files that might
    have come with your module!</p>
<p class="Pp">Also note that these instructions are tailored for installing the
    module into your system's repository of Perl modules, but you can install
    modules into any directory you wish. For instance, where I say
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot;</span>, you can substitute
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl Makefile.PL</span>
    <span class="Li">PREFIX=/my/perl_directory&quot;</span> to install the
    modules into <i>/my/perl_directory</i>. Then you can use the modules from
    your Perl programs with <span class="Li">&quot;use lib
    &quot;/my/perl_directory/lib/site_perl&quot;;&quot;</span> or sometimes just
    <span class="Li">&quot;use &quot;/my/perl_directory&quot;;&quot;</span>. If
    you're on a system that requires superuser/root access to install modules
    into the directories you see when you type <span class="Li">&quot;perl -e
    &quot;print qq(@INC)&quot;&quot;</span>, you'll want to install them into a
    local directory (such as your home directory) and use this approach.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><b>If you're on a Unix or Unix-like system,</b>
    <p class="Pp">You can use Andreas Koenig's CPAN module (
        &lt;http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/CPAN&gt; ) to automate the
        following steps, from DECOMPRESS through INSTALL.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A. DECOMPRESS</p>
    <p class="Pp">Decompress the file with <span class="Li">&quot;gzip -d
        yourmodule.tar.gz&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="Pp">You can get gzip from
      &lt;ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/&gt;</p>
    <p class="Pp">Or, you can combine this step with the next to save disk
        space:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
     gzip -dc yourmodule.tar.gz | tar -xof -
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">B. UNPACK</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unpack the result with <span class="Li">&quot;tar -xof
        yourmodule.tar&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="Pp">C. BUILD</p>
    <p class="Pp">Go into the newly-created directory and type:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
      perl Makefile.PL
      make test
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
      perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/my/perl_directory
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">to install it locally. (Remember that if you do this, you'll
        have to put <span class="Li">&quot;use lib
        &quot;/my/perl_directory&quot;;&quot;</span> near the top of the program
        that is to use this module.</p>
    <p class="Pp">D. INSTALL</p>
    <p class="Pp">While still in that directory, type:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
      make install
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Make sure you have the appropriate permissions to install the
        module in your Perl 5 library directory. Often, you'll need to be
      root.</p>
    <p class="Pp">That's all you need to do on Unix systems with dynamic
        linking. Most Unix systems have dynamic linking. If yours doesn't, or if
        for another reason you have a statically-linked perl, <b>and</b> the
        module requires compilation, you'll need to build a new Perl binary that
        includes the module. Again, you'll probably need to be root.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>If you're running ActivePerl (Win95/98/2K/NT/XP, Linux, Solaris),</b>
    <p class="Pp">First, type <span class="Li">&quot;ppm&quot;</span> from a
        shell and see whether ActiveState's PPM repository has your module. If
        so, you can install it with <span class="Li">&quot;ppm&quot;</span> and
        you won't have to bother with any of the other steps here. You might be
        able to use the CPAN instructions from the &quot;Unix or Linux&quot;
        section above as well; give it a try. Otherwise, you'll have to follow
        the steps below.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   A. DECOMPRESS
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can use the shareware Winzip (
        &lt;http://www.winzip.com&gt; ) to decompress and unpack modules.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   B. UNPACK
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you used WinZip, this was already done for you.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   C. BUILD
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You'll need the <span class="Li">&quot;nmake&quot;</span>
        utility, available at
        &lt;http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/Patch/1.52/W95/EN-US/nmake15.exe&gt;
        or dmake, available on CPAN.
      &lt;https://metacpan.org/release/dmake&gt;</p>
    <p class="Pp">Does the module require compilation (i.e. does it have files
        that end in .xs, .c, .h, .y, .cc, .cxx, or .C)? If it does, life is now
        officially tough for you, because you have to compile the module
        yourself (no easy feat on Windows). You'll need a compiler such as
        Visual C++. Alternatively, you can download a pre-built PPM package from
        ActiveState.
        &lt;http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActivePerl/PPM/&gt;</p>
    <p class="Pp">Go into the newly-created directory and type:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
      perl Makefile.PL
      nmake test


   D. INSTALL
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">While still in that directory, type:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
      nmake install
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li><b>If you're on the DJGPP port of DOS,</b>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   A. DECOMPRESS
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">djtarx ( &lt;ftp://ftp.delorie.com/pub/djgpp/current/v2/&gt; )
        will both uncompress and unpack.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   B. UNPACK
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">See above.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   C. BUILD
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Go into the newly-created directory and type:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
      perl Makefile.PL
      make test
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You will need the packages mentioned in <i>README.dos</i> in
        the Perl distribution.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   D. INSTALL
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">While still in that directory, type:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
     make install
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You will need the packages mentioned in <i>README.dos</i> in
        the Perl distribution.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>If you're on OS/2,</b>
    <p class="Pp">Get the EMX development suite and gzip/tar, from either Hobbes
        ( &lt;http://hobbes.nmsu.edu&gt; ) or Leo ( &lt;http://www.leo.org&gt;
        ), and then follow the instructions for Unix.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>If you're on VMS,</b>
    <p class="Pp">When downloading from CPAN, save your file with a
        <span class="Li">&quot;.tgz&quot;</span> extension instead of
        <span class="Li">&quot;.tar.gz&quot;</span>. All other periods in the
        filename should be replaced with underscores. For example,
        <span class="Li">&quot;Your-Module-1.33.tar.gz&quot;</span> should be
        downloaded as
      <span class="Li">&quot;Your-Module-1_33.tgz&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A. DECOMPRESS</p>
    <p class="Pp">Type</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    gzip -d Your-Module.tgz
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or, for zipped modules, type</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    unzip Your-Module.zip
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Executables for gzip, zip, and VMStar:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    http://www.hp.com/go/openvms/freeware/
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">and their source code:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    http://www.fsf.org/order/ftp.html
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that GNU's gzip/gunzip is not the same as Info-ZIP's
        zip/unzip package. The former is a simple compression tool; the latter
        permits creation of multi-file archives.</p>
    <p class="Pp">B. UNPACK</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you're using VMStar:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
     VMStar xf Your-Module.tar
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Or, if you're fond of VMS command syntax:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
     tar/extract/verbose Your_Module.tar
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">C. BUILD</p>
    <p class="Pp">Make sure you have MMS (from Digital) or the freeware MMK (
        available from MadGoat at &lt;http://www.madgoat.com&gt; ). Then type
        this to create the DESCRIP.MMS for the module:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    perl Makefile.PL
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Now you're ready to build:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    mms test
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Substitute <span class="Li">&quot;mmk&quot;</span> for
        <span class="Li">&quot;mms&quot;</span> above if you're using MMK.</p>
    <p class="Pp">D. INSTALL</p>
    <p class="Pp">Type</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    mms install
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Substitute <span class="Li">&quot;mmk&quot;</span> for
        <span class="Li">&quot;mms&quot;</span> above if you're using MMK.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>If you're on MVS</b>,
    <p class="Pp">Introduce the <i>.tar.gz</i> file into an HFS as binary; don't
        translate from ASCII to EBCDIC.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A. DECOMPRESS</p>
    <p class="Pp">Decompress the file with <span class="Li">&quot;gzip -d
        yourmodule.tar.gz&quot;</span></p>
    <p class="Pp">You can get gzip from
        &lt;http://www.s390.ibm.com/products/oe/bpxqp1.html&gt;</p>
    <p class="Pp">B. UNPACK</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unpack the result with</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
     pax -o to=IBM-1047,from=ISO8859-1 -r &lt; yourmodule.tar
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The BUILD and INSTALL steps are identical to those for Unix.
        Some modules generate Makefiles that work better with GNU make, which is
        available from &lt;http://www.mks.com/s390/gnu/&gt;</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PORTABILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Note that not all modules will work with on all platforms. See
    perlport for more information on portability issues. Read the documentation
    to see if the module will work on your system. There are basically three
    categories of modules that will not work &quot;out of the box&quot; with all
    platforms (with some possibility of overlap):</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><b>Those that should, but don't.</b> These need to be fixed; consider
      contacting the author and possibly writing a patch.</li>
  <li><b>Those that need to be compiled, where the target platform</b>
      <b>doesn't have compilers readily available.</b> (These modules contain
      <i>.xs</i> or <i>.c</i> files, usually.) You might be able to find
      existing binaries on the CPAN or elsewhere, or you might want to try
      getting compilers and building it yourself, and then release the binary
      for other poor souls to use.</li>
  <li><b>Those that are targeted at a specific platform.</b> (Such as the
      Win32:: modules.) If the module is targeted specifically at a platform
      other than yours, you're out of luck, most likely.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Check the CPAN Testers if a module should work with your platform
    but it doesn't behave as you'd expect, or you aren't sure whether or not a
    module will work under your platform. If the module you want isn't listed
    there, you can test it yourself and let CPAN Testers know, you can join CPAN
    Testers, or you can request it be tested.</p>
