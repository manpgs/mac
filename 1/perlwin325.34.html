<p class="Pp">perlwin32 - Perl under Windows</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="permalink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">These are instructions for building Perl under Windows 2000 and
    later.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Before you start, you should glance through the README file found
    in the top-level directory to which the Perl distribution was extracted.
    Make sure you read and understand the terms under which this software is
    being distributed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also make sure you read &quot;BUGS AND CAVEATS&quot; below for the
    known limitations of this port.</p>
<p class="Pp">The INSTALL file in the perl top-level has much information that
    is only relevant to people building Perl on Unix-like systems. In
    particular, you can safely ignore any information that talks about
    &quot;Configure&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may also want to look at one other option for building a perl
    that will work on Windows: the README.cygwin file, which give a different
    set of rules to build a perl for Windows. This method will probably enable
    you to build a more Unix-compatible perl, but you will also need to download
    and use various other build-time and run-time support software described in
    that file.</p>
<p class="Pp">This set of instructions is meant to describe a so-called
    &quot;native&quot; port of Perl to the Windows platform. This includes both
    32-bit and 64-bit Windows operating systems. The resulting Perl requires no
    additional software to run (other than what came with your operating
    system). Currently, this port is capable of using one of the following
    compilers on the Intel x86 architecture:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>      Microsoft Visual C++    version 6.0 or later
      Intel C++ Compiler      (experimental)
      Gcc by mingw.org        gcc version 3.4.5-5.3.0
      Gcc by mingw-w64.org    gcc version 4.4.3 or later
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that the last two of these are actually competing projects
    both delivering complete gcc toolchain for MS Windows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&lt;http://mingw.org&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Delivers gcc toolchain targeting 32-bit Windows platform.</dd>
  <dt>&lt;http://mingw-w64.org&gt;</dt>
  <dd>Delivers gcc toolchain targeting both 64-bit Windows and 32-bit Windows
      platforms (despite the project name &quot;mingw-w64&quot; they are not
      only 64-bit oriented). They deliver the native gcc compilers and
      cross-compilers that are also supported by perl's makefile.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The Microsoft Visual C++ compilers are also now being given away
    free. They are available as &quot;Visual C++ Toolkit 2003&quot; or
    &quot;Visual C++ 2005-2022 Express [or Community, from 2017] Edition&quot;
    (and also as part of the &quot;.NET Framework SDK&quot;) and are the same
    compilers that ship with &quot;Visual C++ .NET 2003 Professional&quot; or
    &quot;Visual C++ 2005-2022 Professional&quot; respectively.</p>
<p class="Pp">This port can also be built on IA64/AMD64 using:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>      Microsoft Platform SDK    Nov 2001 (64-bit compiler and tools)
      MinGW64 compiler (gcc version 4.4.3 or later)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The Windows SDK can be downloaded from
    &lt;https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/sdk-archive&gt;. The
    MinGW64 compiler is available at &lt;http://mingw-w64.org&gt;. The latter is
    actually a cross-compiler targeting Win64. There's also a trimmed down
    compiler (no java, or gfortran) suitable for building perl available at:
    &lt;http://strawberryperl.com/package/kmx/64_gcctoolchain/&gt;</p>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: If you're using a 32-bit compiler to build perl on a 64-bit
    Windows operating system, then you should set the WIN64 environment variable
    to &quot;undef&quot;. Also, the trimmed down compiler only passes tests when
    USE_ITHREADS *= define (as opposed to undef) and when the CFG *= Debug line
    is commented out.</p>
<p class="Pp">This port fully supports MakeMaker (the set of modules that is
    used to build extensions to perl). Therefore, you should be able to build
    and install most extensions found in the CPAN sites. See &quot;Usage Hints
    for Perl on Windows&quot; below for general hints about this.</p>

  Up Perl on Windows</a></h2>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Make"><a class="permalink" href="#Make">Make</a></dt>
  <dd>You need a &quot;make&quot; program to build the sources. If you are using
      Visual C++ or the Windows SDK tools, you can use nmake supplied with
      Visual C++ or Windows SDK. You may also use gmake instead of nmake. Builds
      using gcc need gmake. nmake is not supported for gcc builds. Parallel
      building is only supported with gmake, not nmake.</dd>
  <dt id="Command"><a class="permalink" href="#Command">Command Shell</a></dt>
  <dd>Use the default &quot;cmd&quot; shell that comes with Windows. Some
      versions of the popular 4DOS/NT shell have incompatibilities that may
      cause you trouble. If the build fails under that shell, try building again
      with the cmd shell.
    <p class="Pp">Make sure the path to the build directory does not contain
        spaces. The build usually works in this circumstance, but some tests
        will fail.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Microsoft"><a class="permalink" href="#Microsoft">Microsoft Visual
    C++</a></dt>
  <dd>The nmake that comes with Visual C++ will suffice for building. Visual C++
      requires that certain things be set up in the console before Visual C++
      will successfully run. To make a console box be able to run the C
      compiler, you will need to beforehand, run
      <span class="Li">&quot;vcvarsall.bat x86&quot;</span> to compile for
      x86-32 and for x86-64 <span class="Li">&quot;vcvarsall.bat
      amd64&quot;</span>. On a typical install of a Microsoft C++ compiler
      product, these batch files will already be in your
      <span class="Li">&quot;PATH&quot;</span> environment variable so you may
      just type them without an absolute path into your console. If you need to
      find the absolute path to the batch file, it is usually found somewhere
      like C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC. With some
      newer Microsoft C products (released after ~2004), the installer will put
      a shortcut in the start menu to launch a new console window with the
      console already set up for your target architecture (x86-32 or x86-64 or
      IA64). With the newer compilers, you may also use the older batch files if
      you choose so.</dd>

  <dd>These free versions of Visual C++ 2008-2022 Professional contain the same
      compilers and linkers that ship with the full versions, and also contain
      everything necessary to build Perl, rather than requiring a separate
      download of the Windows SDK like previous versions did.
    <p class="Pp">These packages can be downloaded by searching in the Download
        Center at
        &lt;https://www.microsoft.com/downloads/search.aspx?displaylang=en&gt;.
        (Providing exact links to these packages has proven a pointless task
        because the links keep on changing so often.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Install Visual C++ 2008-2022 Express/Community, then setup
        your environment using, e.g.</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">

    <p class="Pp">Copy it from there to

  <li>setargv.obj is required to build perlglob.exe (and perl.exe if the

      in source form in <span class="Li">%PlatformSDKDir</span>%\src\crt. Copy

  <dt id="Intel"><a class="permalink" href="#Intel">Intel C++ Compiler</a></dt>
  <dd>Experimental support for using Intel C++ Compiler has been added. Edit
      win32/Makefile and pick the correct CCTYPE for the Visual C that Intel C
      was installed into. Also uncomment __ICC to enable Intel C on Visual C

    <p class="Pp">Only Intel C++ Compiler v12.1 has been tested. Other versions

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Building"><a class="permalink" href="#Building">Building</a></h2>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Make sure you are in the &quot;win32&quot; subdirectory under the perl
      toplevel. This directory contains a &quot;Makefile&quot; that will work
      with versions of nmake that come with Visual C++ or the Windows SDK, and a
      GNU make &quot;GNUmakefile&quot; that will work for all supported
      compilers. The defaults in the gmake makefile are setup to build using
      MinGW/gcc.</li>
  <li>Edit the GNUmakefile (or Makefile, if you're using nmake) and change the
      values of INST_DRV and INST_TOP. You can also enable various build flags.
      These are explained in the makefiles.
    <p class="Pp">Note that it is generally not a good idea to try to build a
        perl with INST_DRV and INST_TOP set to a path that already exists from a
        previous build. In particular, this may cause problems with the
        lib/ExtUtils/t/Embed.t test, which attempts to build a test program and
        may end up building against the installed perl's lib/CORE directory
        rather than the one being tested.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You will have to make sure that CCTYPE is set correctly and
        that CCHOME points to wherever you installed your compiler. For GCC this
        should be the directory that contains the <i>bin</i>, <i>include</i> and
        <i>lib</i> directories.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If building with the cross-compiler provided by mingw-w64.org
        you'll need to uncomment the line that sets GCCCROSS in the GNUmakefile.
        Do this only if it's the cross-compiler - ie only if the bin folder
        doesn't contain a gcc.exe. (The cross-compiler does not provide a
        gcc.exe, g++.exe, ar.exe, etc. Instead, all of these executables are
        prefixed with 'x86_64-w64-mingw32-'.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">The default value for CCHOME in the makefiles for Visual C++
        may not be correct for some versions. Make sure the default exists and
        is valid.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you want build some core extensions statically into perl's
        dll, specify them in the STATIC_EXT macro.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Be sure to read the instructions near the top of the makefiles
        carefully.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Type &quot;gmake&quot; (or &quot;nmake&quot; if you are using that make).
    <p class="Pp">This should build everything. Specifically, it will create
        perl.exe, perl534.dll at the perl toplevel, and various other extension
        dll's under the lib\auto directory. If the build fails for any reason,
        make sure you have done the previous steps correctly.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To try gmake's parallel mode, type &quot;gmake -j2&quot;,
        where 2, is the maximum number of parallel jobs you want to run. A
        number of things in the build process will run in parallel, but there
        are serialization points where you will see just 1 CPU maxed out. This
        is normal.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you are advanced enough with building C code, here is a
        suggestion to speed up building perl, and the later
        <span class="Li">&quot;make test&quot;</span>. Try to keep your PATH
        environmental variable with the least number of folders possible
        (remember to keep your C compiler's folders there).
        <span class="Li">&quot;C:\WINDOWS\system32&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;C:\WINNT\system32&quot;</span> depending on your
        OS version should be first folder in PATH, since &quot;cmd.exe&quot; is
        the most commonly launched program during the build and later
      testing.</p>

    <i>cpan/HTTP-Tiny/t/110_mirror.t</i> and <i>lib/File/Copy.t</i>. The
    failures are caused by bugs in the CRT in VC++ 2013 which are fixed in
    VC++2015 and later, as explained by Microsoft here:
    &lt;https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/811534/utime-sometimes-fails-to-set-the-correct-file-times-in-visual-c-2013&gt;.
    In the meantime, if you need fixed <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span>
    and <span class="Li">&quot;utime&quot;</span> functions then have a look at
    the CPAN distribution Win32::UTCFileTime.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you build with Visual C++ 2015 or later then
    <i>ext/XS-APItest/t/locale.t</i> may crash (after all its tests have
    passed). This is due to a regression in the Universal CRT introduced in the
    Windows 10 April 2018 Update, and will be fixed in the May 2019 Update, as
    explained here:
    &lt;https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/519486/setlocalelc-numeric-iso-latin-16-fails-then-succee.html&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you build with certain versions (e.g. 4.8.1) of gcc from
    www.mingw.org then <i>ext/POSIX/t/time.t</i> may fail test 17 due to a known
    bug in those gcc builds: see
    &lt;https://sourceforge.net/p/mingw/bugs/2152/&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some test failures may occur if you use a command shell other than
    the native &quot;cmd.exe&quot;, or if you are building from a path that
    contains spaces. So don't do that.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are running the tests from a emacs shell window, you may
    see failures in op/stat.t. Run &quot;gmake test-notty&quot; in that
  case.</p>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, you should make sure that during
    <span class="Li">&quot;make test&quot;</span> you do not have any GNU tool
    packages in your path: some toolkits like Unixutils include some tools
    (<span class="Li">&quot;type&quot;</span> for instance) which override the
    Windows ones and makes tests fail. Remove them from your path while testing
    to avoid these errors.</p>
<p class="Pp">To see the output of specific failing tests run the harness from
    the t directory:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  # assuming you're starting from the win32 directory
  cd ..\win32
  .\perl harness &lt;list of tests&gt;

  <dd>The installation paths that you set during the build get compiled into
      perl, so you don't have to do anything additional to start using that perl
      (except add its location to your PATH variable).
    <p class="Pp">If you put extensions in unusual places, you can set PERL5LIB
        to a list of paths separated by semicolons where you want perl to look

    <p class="Pp">You can also control the shell that perl uses to run
        <b>system()</b> and backtick commands via PERL5SHELL. See perlrun.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl does not depend on the registry, but it can look up
        certain default values if you choose to put them there unless disabled
        at build time with USE_NO_REGISTRY. On Perl process start Perl checks if
        <span class="Li">&quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Perl&quot;</span> and

  <dt id="File"><a class="permalink" href="#File">File Globbing</a></dt>
  <dd>By default, perl handles file globbing using the File::Glob extension,
      which provides portable globbing.
    <p class="Pp">If you want perl to use globbing that emulates the quirks of
        DOS filename conventions, you might want to consider using File::DosGlob
        to override the internal <b>glob()</b> implementation. See File::DosGlob
        for details.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Using"><a class="permalink" href="#Using">Using perl from the command
    line</a></dt>
  <dd>If you are accustomed to using perl from various command-line shells found
      in UNIX environments, you will be less than pleased with what Windows
      offers by way of a command shell.
    <p class="Pp">The crucial thing to understand about the Windows environment
        is that the command line you type in is processed twice before Perl sees
        it. First, your command shell (usually CMD.EXE) preprocesses the command
        line, to handle redirection, environment variable expansion, and
        location of the executable to run. Then, the perl executable splits the
        remaining command line into individual arguments, using the C runtime
        library upon which Perl was built.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is particularly important to note that neither the shell
        nor the C runtime do any wildcard expansions of command-line arguments
        (so wildcards need not be quoted). Also, the quoting behaviours of the
        shell and the C runtime are rudimentary at best (and may, if you are
        using a non-standard shell, be inconsistent). The only (useful) quote
        character is the double quote (&quot;). It can be used to protect spaces
        and other special characters in arguments.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The Windows documentation describes the shell parsing rules
        here:
        &lt;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd&gt;
        and the C runtime parsing rules here:
        &lt;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/17w5ykft%28v=VS.100%29.aspx&gt;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here are some further observations based on experiments: The C
        runtime breaks arguments at spaces and passes them to programs in
        argc/argv. Double quotes can be used to prevent arguments with spaces in
        them from being split up. You can put a double quote in an argument by
        escaping it with a backslash and enclosing the whole argument within
        double quotes. The backslash and the pair of double quotes surrounding
        the argument will be stripped by the C runtime.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The file redirection characters &quot;&lt;&quot;,
        &quot;&gt;&quot;, and &quot;|&quot; can be quoted by double quotes
        (although there are suggestions that this may not always be true).
        Single quotes are not treated as quotes by the shell or the C runtime,
        they don't get stripped by the shell (just to make this type of quoting
        completely useless). The caret &quot;^&quot; has also been observed to
        behave as a quoting character, but this appears to be a shell feature,
        and the caret is not stripped from the command line, so Perl still sees
        it (and the C runtime phase does not treat the caret as a quote
        character).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here are some examples of usage of the &quot;cmd&quot;
      shell:</p>
    <p class="Pp">This prints two doublequotes:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    perl -e &quot;print '\&quot;\&quot;' &quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This does the same:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    perl -e &quot;print \&quot;\\\&quot;\\\&quot;\&quot; &quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This prints &quot;bar&quot; and writes &quot;foo&quot; to the
        file &quot;blurch&quot;:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; &gt; blurch
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This prints &quot;foo&quot; (&quot;bar&quot; disappears into
        nowhereland):</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 2&gt; nul
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This prints &quot;bar&quot; and writes &quot;foo&quot; into
        the file &quot;blurch&quot;:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 1&gt; blurch
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This pipes &quot;foo&quot; to the &quot;less&quot; pager and
        prints &quot;bar&quot; on the console:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    perl -e &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; | less
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This pipes &quot;foo\nbar\n&quot; to the less pager:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    perl -le &quot;print 'foo'; print STDERR 'bar'&quot; 2&gt;&amp;1 | less
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This pipes &quot;foo&quot; to the pager and writes
        &quot;bar&quot; in the file &quot;blurch&quot;:</p>

    <p class="Pp">Discovering the usefulness of the &quot;command.com&quot;
        shell on Windows 9x is left as an exercise to the reader :)</p>
    <p class="Pp">One particularly pernicious problem with the 4NT command shell
        for Windows is that it (nearly) always treats a % character as
        indicating that environment variable expansion is needed. Under this
        shell, it is therefore important to always double any % characters which
        you want Perl to see (for example, for hash variables), even when they
        are quoted.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Building Extensions</dt>
  <dd>The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) offers a wealth of
      extensions, some of which require a C compiler to build. Look in
      &lt;https://www.cpan.org/&gt; for more information on CPAN.
    <p class="Pp">Note that not all of the extensions available from CPAN may
        work in the Windows environment; you should check the information at
        &lt;https://www.cpantesters.org/&gt; before investing too much effort
        into porting modules that don't readily build.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Most extensions (whether they require a C compiler or not) can
        be built, tested and installed with the standard mantra:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    perl Makefile.PL
    $MAKE
    $MAKE test
    $MAKE install
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">where <span class="Li">$MAKE</span> is whatever 'make' program
        you have configured perl to use. Use &quot;perl -V:make&quot; to find
        out what this is. Some extensions may not provide a testsuite (so
        &quot;$MAKE test&quot; may not do anything or fail), but most serious
        ones do.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is important that you use a supported 'make' program, and
        ensure Config.pm knows about it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that MakeMaker actually emits makefiles with different
        syntax depending on what 'make' it thinks you are using. Therefore, it
        is important that one of the following values appears in Config.pm:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    make='nmake'        # MakeMaker emits nmake syntax
    any other value     # MakeMaker emits generic make syntax
                            (e.g GNU make, or Perl make)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the value doesn't match the 'make' program you want to use,
        edit Config.pm to fix it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a module implements XSUBs, you will need one of the
        supported C compilers. You must make sure you have set up the
        environment for the compiler for command-line compilation before running
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl Makefile.PL&quot;</span> or any invocation
        of make.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a module does not build for some reason, look carefully for
        why it failed, and report problems to the module author. If it looks
        like the extension building support is at fault, report that with full
        details of how the build failed using the GitHub issue tracker at
        &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;.</p>

  <dt id="Command-line"><a class="permalink" href="#Command-line">Command-line
    Wildcard Expansion</a></dt>
  <dd>The default command shells on DOS descendant operating systems (such as
      they are) usually do not expand wildcard arguments supplied to programs.
      They consider it the application's job to handle that. This is commonly
      achieved by linking the application (in our case, perl) with startup code
      that the C runtime libraries usually provide. However, doing that results
      in incompatible perl versions (since the behavior of the argv expansion
      code differs depending on the compiler, and it is even buggy on some
      compilers). Besides, it may be a source of frustration if you use such a
      perl binary with an alternate shell that *does* expand wildcards.
    <p class="Pp">Instead, the following solution works rather well. The nice
        things about it are 1) you can start using it right away; 2) it is more
        powerful, because it will do the right thing with a pattern like
        */*/*.c; 3) you can decide whether you do/don't want to use it; and 4)
        you can extend the method to add any customizations (or even entirely
        different kinds of wildcard expansion).</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> C:\&gt; copy con c:\perl\lib\Wild.pm
 # Wild.pm - emulate shell @ARGV expansion on shells that don't
 use File::DosGlob;
 @ARGV = map {
              my @g = File::DosGlob::glob($_) if /[*?]/;
              @g ? @g : $_;
            } @ARGV;
 1;
 ^Z
 C:\&gt; set PERL5OPT=-MWild
 C:\&gt; perl -le &quot;for (@ARGV) { print }&quot; */*/perl*.c
 p4view/perl/perl.c
 p4view/perl/perlio.c
 p4view/perl/perly.c
 perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c
 perl5.005/win32/perllib.c
 perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c
 perl5.005/win32/perllib.c
 perl5.005/win32/perlglob.c
 perl5.005/win32/perllib.c
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note there are two distinct steps there: 1) You'll have to
        create Wild.pm and put it in your perl lib directory. 2) You'll need to
        set the PERL5OPT environment variable. If you want argv expansion to be
        the default, just set PERL5OPT in your default startup environment.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you are using the Visual C compiler, you can get the C
        runtime's command line wildcard expansion built into perl binary. The
        resulting binary will always expand unquoted command lines, which may
        not be what you want if you use a shell that does that for you. The
        expansion done is also somewhat less powerful than the approach
        suggested above.</p>

  <dt id="Notes"><a class="permalink" href="#Notes">Notes on 64-bit
    Windows</a></dt>
  <dd>Windows .NET Server supports the LLP64 data model on the Intel Itanium
      architecture.
    <p class="Pp">The LLP64 data model is different from the LP64 data model
        that is the norm on 64-bit Unix platforms. In the former,
        <span class="Li">&quot;int&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;long&quot;</span> are both 32-bit data types,
        while pointers are 64 bits wide. In addition, there is a separate 64-bit
        wide integral type, <span class="Li">&quot;__int64&quot;</span>. In
        contrast, the LP64 data model that is pervasive on Unix platforms
        provides <span class="Li">&quot;int&quot;</span> as the 32-bit type,
        while both the <span class="Li">&quot;long&quot;</span> type and
        pointers are of 64-bit precision. Note that both models provide for
        64-bits of addressability.</p>
    <p class="Pp">64-bit Windows running on Itanium is capable of running 32-bit
        x86 binaries transparently. This means that you could use a 32-bit build
        of Perl on a 64-bit system. Given this, why would one want to build a
        64-bit build of Perl? Here are some reasons why you would bother:</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Running_Perl_Scripts"><a class="permalink" href="#Running_Perl_Scripts">Running
  Perl Scripts</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl scripts on UNIX use the &quot;#!&quot; (a.k.a
    &quot;shebang&quot;) line to indicate to the OS that it should execute the
    file using perl. Windows has no comparable means to indicate arbitrary files
    are executables.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead, all available methods to execute plain text files on
    Windows rely on the file &quot;extension&quot;. There are three methods to
    use this to execute perl scripts:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>There is a facility called &quot;file extension associations&quot;. This
      can be manipulated via the two commands &quot;assoc&quot; and
      &quot;ftype&quot; that come standard with Windows. Type &quot;ftype
      /?&quot; for a complete example of how to set this up for perl scripts
      (Say what? You thought Windows wasn't perl-ready? :).</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Since file associations don't work everywhere, and there are reportedly
      bugs with file associations where it does work, the old method of wrapping
      the perl script to make it look like a regular batch file to the OS, may
      be used. The install process makes available the &quot;pl2bat.bat&quot;
      script which can be used to wrap perl scripts into batch files. For
      example:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        pl2bat foo.pl
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will create the file &quot;FOO.BAT&quot;. Note
        &quot;pl2bat&quot; strips any .pl suffix and adds a .bat suffix to the
        generated file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you use the 4DOS/NT or similar command shell, note that
        &quot;pl2bat&quot; uses the &quot;%*&quot; variable in the generated
        batch file to refer to all the command line arguments, so you may need
        to make sure that construct works in batch files. As of this writing,
        4DOS/NT users will need a &quot;ParameterChar = *&quot; statement in
        their 4NT.INI file or will need to execute &quot;setdos /p*&quot; in the
        4DOS/NT startup file to enable this to work.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>Using &quot;pl2bat&quot; has a few problems: the file name gets changed,
      so scripts that rely on <span class="Li">$0</span> to find what they must
      do may not run properly; running &quot;pl2bat&quot; replicates the
      contents of the original script, and so this process can be maintenance
      intensive if the originals get updated often. A different approach that
      avoids both problems is possible.
    <p class="Pp">A script called &quot;runperl.bat&quot; is available that can
        be copied to any filename (along with the .bat suffix). For example, if
        you call it &quot;foo.bat&quot;, it will run the file &quot;foo&quot;
        when it is executed. Since you can run batch files on Windows platforms
        simply by typing the name (without the extension), this effectively runs
        the file &quot;foo&quot;, when you type either &quot;foo&quot; or
        &quot;foo.bat&quot;. With this method, &quot;foo.bat&quot; can even be
        in a different location than the file &quot;foo&quot;, as long as
        &quot;foo&quot; is available somewhere on the PATH. If your scripts are
        on a filesystem that allows symbolic links, you can even avoid copying
        &quot;runperl.bat&quot;.</p>

<p class="Pp">A full set of HTML documentation is installed, so you should be
    able to use it if you have a web browser installed on your system.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;perldoc&quot;</span> is also a useful tool
    for browsing information contained in the documentation, especially in
    conjunction with a pager like <span class="Li">&quot;less&quot;</span>
    (recent versions of which have Windows support). You may have to set the
    PAGER environment variable to use a specific pager. &quot;perldoc -f
    foo&quot; will print information about the perl operator
  &quot;foo&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">One common mistake when using this port with a GUI library like
    <span class="Li">&quot;Tk&quot;</span> is assuming that Perl's normal
    behavior of opening a command-line window will go away. This isn't the case.
    If you want to start a copy of <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span>
    without opening a command-line window, use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;wperl&quot;</span> executable built during the
    installation process. Usage is exactly the same as normal
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span> on Windows, except that options
    like <span class="Li">&quot;-h&quot;</span> don't work (since they need a
    command-line window to print to).</p>

<p class="Pp">Norton AntiVirus interferes with the build process, particularly
    if set to &quot;AutoProtect, All Files, when Opened&quot;. Unlike large
    applications the perl build process opens and modifies a lot of files.
    Having the AntiVirus scan each and every one slows build the process
    significantly. Worse, with PERLIO=stdio the build process fails with
    peculiar messages as the virus checker interacts badly with miniperl.exe
    writing configure files (it seems to either catch file part written and
    treat it as suspicious, or virus checker may have it &quot;locked&quot; in a
    way which inhibits miniperl updating it). The build does complete with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>   set PERLIO=perlio
</pre>
<p class="Pp">but that may be just luck. Other AntiVirus software may have
    similar issues.</p>
<p class="Pp">A git GUI shell extension for Windows such as TortoiseGit will
    cause the build and later <span class="Li">&quot;make test&quot;</span> to
    run much slower since every file is checked for its git status as soon as it
    is created and/or modified. TortoiseGit doesn't cause any test failures or
    build problems unlike the antivirus software described above, but it does
    cause similar slowness. It is suggested to use Task Manager to look for
    background processes which use high CPU amounts during the building
  process.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some of the built-in functions do not act exactly as documented in
    perlfunc, and a few are not implemented at all. To avoid surprises,
    particularly if you have had prior exposure to Perl in other operating
    environments or if you intend to write code that will be portable to other
    environments, see perlport for a reasonably definitive list of these
    differences.</p>
<p class="Pp">Not all extensions available from CPAN may build or work properly
    in the Windows environment. See &quot;Building Extensions&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most <span class="Li">&quot;socket()&quot;</span> related calls
    are supported, but they may not behave as on Unix platforms. See perlport
    for the full list.</p>
<p class="Pp">Signal handling may not behave as on Unix platforms (where it
    doesn't exactly &quot;behave&quot;, either :). For instance, calling
    <span class="Li">&quot;die()&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;exit()&quot;</span> from signal handlers will cause
    an exception, since most implementations of
    <span class="Li">&quot;signal()&quot;</span> on Windows are severely
    crippled. Thus, signals may work only for simple things like setting a flag
    variable in the handler. Using signals under this port should currently be
    considered unsupported.</p>
<p class="Pp">Please report detailed descriptions of any problems and solutions
    that you may find at &lt;&lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;&gt;,
    along with the output produced by <span class="Li">&quot;perl
    -V&quot;</span>.</p>
