<p class="Pp">Reads a packed archive (.pack) from the specified file, and builds
    a pack index file (.idx) for it. Optionally writes a reverse-index (.rev)
    for the specified pack. The packed archive together with the pack index can
    then be placed in the objects/pack/ directory of a Git repository.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">-v</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Be verbose about what is going on, including progress
  status.</div>
<p class="Pp">-o &lt;index-file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Write the generated pack index into the specified file.
  Without this option the name of pack index file is constructed from the name
  of packed archive file by replacing .pack with .idx (and the program fails if
  the name of packed archive does not end with .pack).</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]rev-index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When this flag is provided, generate a reverse index (a
  <b>.rev</b> file) corresponding to the given pack. If <b>--verify</b> is
  given, ensure that the existing reverse index is correct. Takes precedence
  over <b>pack.writeReverseIndex</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--stdin</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When this flag is provided, the pack is read from stdin
  instead and a copy is then written to &lt;pack-file&gt;. If &lt;pack-file&gt;
  is not specified, the pack is written to objects/pack/ directory of the
  current Git repository with a default name determined from the pack content.
  If &lt;pack-file&gt; is not specified consider using --keep to prevent a race
  condition between this process and <i>git repack</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--fix-thin</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Fix a &quot;thin&quot; pack produced by <b>git
  pack-objects --thin</b> (see <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1) for details) by adding
  the excluded objects the deltified objects are based on to the pack. This
  option only makes sense in conjunction with --stdin.</div>
<p class="Pp">--keep</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Before moving the index into its final destination create
  an empty .keep file for the associated pack file. This option is usually
  necessary with --stdin to prevent a simultaneous <i>git repack</i> process
  from deleting the newly constructed pack and index before refs can be updated
  to use objects contained in the pack.</div>
<p class="Pp">--keep=&lt;msg&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Like --keep create a .keep file before moving the index
  into its final destination, but rather than creating an empty file place
  <i>&lt;msg&gt;</i> followed by an LF into the .keep file. The
  <i>&lt;msg&gt;</i> message can later be searched for within all .keep files to
  locate any which have outlived their usefulness.</div>
<p class="Pp">--index-version=&lt;version&gt;[,&lt;offset&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is intended to be used by the test suite only. It
  allows to force the version for the generated pack index, and to force 64-bit
  index entries on objects located above the given offset.</div>
<p class="Pp">--strict</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Die, if the pack contains broken objects or links.</div>
<p class="Pp">--progress-title</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For internal use only.
<p class="Pp">Set the title of the progress bar. The title is &quot;Receiving
    objects&quot; by default and &quot;Indexing objects&quot; when
    <b>--stdin</b> is specified.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--check-self-contained-and-connected</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Die if the pack contains broken links. For internal use
  only.</div>
<p class="Pp">--fsck-objects</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For internal use only.
<p class="Pp">Die if the pack contains broken objects. If the pack contains a
    tree pointing to a .gitmodules blob that does not exist, prints the hash of
    that blob (for the caller to check) after the hash that goes into the name
    of the pack/idx file (see &quot;Notes&quot;).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--threads=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the number of threads to spawn when resolving
  deltas. This requires that index-pack be compiled with pthreads otherwise this
  option is ignored with a warning. This is meant to reduce packing time on
  multiprocessor machines. The required amount of memory for the delta search
  window is however multiplied by the number of threads. Specifying 0 will cause
  Git to auto-detect the number of CPU&#x2019;s and use maximum 3 threads.</div>
<p class="Pp">--max-input-size=&lt;size&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Die, if the pack is larger than &lt;size&gt;.</div>
<p class="Pp">--object-format=&lt;hash-algorithm&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the given object format (hash algorithm) for the
  pack. The valid values are <i>sha1</i> and (if enabled) <i>sha256</i>. The
  default is the algorithm for the current repository (set by
  <b>extensions.objectFormat</b>), or <i>sha1</i> if no value is set or outside
  a repository.
<p class="Pp">This option cannot be used with --stdin.</p>
<p class="Pp">THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL! SHA-256 support is experimental and
    still in an early stage. A SHA-256 repository will in general not be able to
    share work with &quot;regular&quot; SHA-1 repositories. It should be assumed
    that, e.g., Git internal file formats in relation to SHA-256 repositories
    may change in backwards-incompatible ways. Only use
    <b>--object-format=sha256</b> for testing purposes.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--promisor[=&lt;message&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Before committing the pack-index, create a .promisor file
  for this pack. Particularly helpful when writing a promisor pack with
  --fix-thin since the name of the pack is not final until the pack has been
  fully written. If a <b>&lt;message&gt;</b> is provided, then that content will
  be written to the .promisor file for future reference. See <b>partial
  clone</b>[1] for more information.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Once the index has been created, the hash that goes into the name
    of the pack/idx file is printed to stdout. If --stdin was also used then
    this is prefixed by either &quot;pack\t&quot;, or &quot;keep\t&quot; if a
    new .keep file was successfully created. This is useful to remove a .keep
    file used as a lock to prevent the race with <i>git repack</i> mentioned
    above.</p>
