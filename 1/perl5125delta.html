<p class="Pp">This document describes differences between the 5.12.4 release and
    the 5.12.5 release.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.3, first
    read perl5124delta, which describes differences between 5.12.3 and
  5.12.4.</p>

  decode_xs n-byte heap-overflow (CVE-2011-2939)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A bug in <span class="Li">&quot;Encode&quot;</span> could, on
    certain inputs, cause the heap to overflow. This problem has been corrected.

  memory error with GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC (CVE-2011-2728).</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Calling <span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob&quot;</span>
    with the unsupported flag GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC would cause an access violation /
    segfault. A Perl program that accepts a flags value from an external source
    could expose itself to denial of service or arbitrary code execution
    attacks. There are no known exploits in the wild. The problem has been
    corrected by explicitly disabling all unsupported flags and setting unused
    function pointers to null. Bug reported by Clement Lecigne.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Heap_buffer_overrun_in_'x'_string_repeat_operator_("><a class="permalink" href="#Heap_buffer_overrun_in_'x'_string_repeat_operator_(">Heap
  buffer overrun in 'x' string repeat operator (CVE-2012-5195)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Poorly written perl code that allows an attacker to specify the
    count to perl's 'x' string repeat operator can already cause a memory
    exhaustion denial-of-service attack. A flaw in versions of perl before
    5.15.5 can escalate that into a heap buffer overrun; coupled with versions
    of glibc before 2.16, it possibly allows the execution of arbitrary
  code.</p>
<p class="Pp">This problem has been fixed.</p>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;chop&quot;</span> now correctly handles characters
      above &quot;\x{7fffffff}&quot; [perl #73246].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;($&lt;,$&gt;) = (...)&quot;</span> stopped working
      properly in 5.12.0. It is supposed to make a single
      <span class="Li">&quot;setreuid()&quot;</span> call, rather than calling
      <span class="Li">&quot;setruid()&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;seteuid()&quot;</span> separately. Consequently it
      did not work properly. This has been fixed [perl #75212].</li>
  <li>Fixed a regression of <b>kill()</b> when a match variable is used for the
      process ID to kill [perl #75812].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;UNIVERSAL::VERSION&quot;</span> no longer leaks
      memory. It started leaking in Perl 5.10.0.</li>
  <li>The C-level <span class="Li">&quot;my_strftime&quot;</span> functions no
      longer leaks memory. This fixes a memory leak in
      <span class="Li">&quot;POSIX::strftime&quot;</span> [perl #73520].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span> no longer leaks memory when
      called from the DB package if <span class="Li">@DB::args</span> was
      assigned to after the first call to
      <span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span>. Carp was triggering this bug
      [perl #97010].</li>
  <li>Passing to <span class="Li">&quot;index&quot;</span> an offset beyond the
      end of the string when the string is encoded internally in UTF8 no longer
      causes panics [perl #75898].</li>
  <li>Syntax errors in <span class="Li">&quot;(?{...})&quot;</span> blocks in
      regular expressions no longer cause panic messages [perl #2353].</li>
  <li>Perl 5.10.0 introduced some faulty logic that made &quot;U*&quot; in the
      middle of a pack template equivalent to &quot;U0&quot; if the input string
      was empty. This has been fixed [perl #90160].</li>

<h2 class="Ss"><b>split()</b> and @_</h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>split()</b> no longer modifies <span class="Li">@_</span> when
    called in scalar or void context. In void context it now produces a
    &quot;Useless use of split&quot; warning. This is actually a change
    introduced in perl 5.12.0, but it was missed from that release's
    perl5120delta.</p>

<p class="Pp">Perl 5.12.5 represents approximately 17 months of development
    since Perl 5.12.4 and contains approximately 1,900 lines of changes across
    64 files from 18 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.12.5:</p>
<p class="Pp">Andy Dougherty, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, David
    Mitchell, Dominic Hargreaves, Father Chrysostomos, Florian Ragwitz, George
    Greer, Goro Fuji, Jesse Vincent, Karl Williamson, Leon Brocard, Nicholas
    Clark, Rafael Garcia-Suarez, Reini Urban, Ricardo Signes, Steve Hay, Tony
    Cook.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Reporting_Bugs"><a class="permalink" href="#Reporting_Bugs">Reporting
  Bugs</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
    recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
    database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
    http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the
    <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug
    down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the
    output of <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a
    resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
