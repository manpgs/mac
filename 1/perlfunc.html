<p class="Pp">The functions in this section can serve as terms in an expression.
    They fall into two major categories: list operators and named unary
    operators. These differ in their precedence relationship with a following
    comma. (See the precedence table in perlop.) List operators take more than
    one argument, while unary operators can never take more than one argument.
    Thus, a comma terminates the argument of a unary operator, but merely
    separates the arguments of a list operator. A unary operator generally
    provides scalar context to its argument, while a list operator may provide
    either scalar or list contexts for its arguments. If it does both, scalar
    arguments come first and list argument follow, and there can only ever be
    one such list argument. For instance,
    <span class="Li">&quot;splice&quot;</span> has three scalar arguments
    followed by a list, whereas
    <span class="Li">&quot;gethostbyname&quot;</span> has four scalar
  arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the syntax descriptions that follow, list operators that expect
    a list (and provide list context for elements of the list) are shown with
    LIST as an argument. Such a list may consist of any combination of scalar
    arguments or list values; the list values will be included in the list as if
    each individual element were interpolated at that point in the list, forming
    a longer single-dimensional list value. Commas should separate literal
    elements of the LIST.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any function in the list below may be used either with or without
    parentheses around its arguments. (The syntax descriptions omit the
    parentheses.) If you use parentheses, the simple but occasionally surprising
    rule is this: It <i>looks</i> like a function, therefore it <i>is</i> a
    function, and precedence doesn't matter. Otherwise it's a list operator or
    unary operator, and precedence does matter. Whitespace between the function
    and left parenthesis doesn't count, so sometimes you need to be careful:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print 1+2+4;      # Prints 7.
    print(1+2) + 4;   # Prints 3.
    print (1+2)+4;    # Also prints 3!
    print +(1+2)+4;   # Prints 7.
    print ((1+2)+4);  # Prints 7.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you run Perl with the <span class="Li">&quot;use
    warnings&quot;</span> pragma, it can warn you about this. For example, the
    third line above produces:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print (...) interpreted as function at - line 1.
    Useless use of integer addition in void context at - line 1.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A few functions take no arguments at all, and therefore work as
    neither unary nor list operators. These include such functions as
    <span class="Li">&quot;time&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;endpwent&quot;</span>. For example,
    <span class="Li">&quot;time+86_400&quot;</span> always means
    <span class="Li">&quot;time() + 86_400&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For functions that can be used in either a scalar or list context,
    nonabortive failure is generally indicated in scalar context by returning
    the undefined value, and in list context by returning the empty list.</p>
<p class="Pp">Remember the following important rule: There is <b>no rule</b>
    that relates the behavior of an expression in list context to its behavior
    in scalar context, or vice versa. It might do two totally different things.
    Each operator and function decides which sort of value would be most
    appropriate to return in scalar context. Some operators return the length of
    the list that would have been returned in list context. Some operators
    return the first value in the list. Some operators return the last value in
    the list. Some operators return a count of successful operations. In
    general, they do what you want, unless you want consistency.</p>
<p class="Pp">A named array in scalar context is quite different from what would
    at first glance appear to be a list in scalar context. You can't get a list
    like <span class="Li">&quot;(1,2,3)&quot;</span> into being in scalar
    context, because the compiler knows the context at compile time. It would
    generate the scalar comma operator there, not the list concatenation version
    of the comma. That means it was never a list to start with.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, functions in Perl that serve as wrappers for system
    calls (&quot;syscalls&quot;) of the same name (like <b>chown</b>(2),
    <b>fork</b>(2), <b>closedir</b>(2), etc.) return true when they succeed and
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> otherwise, as is usually mentioned
    in the descriptions below. This is different from the C interfaces, which
    return <span class="Li">&quot;-1&quot;</span> on failure. Exceptions to this
    rule include <span class="Li">&quot;wait&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;waitpid&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;syscall&quot;</span>. System calls also set the
    special <span class="Li">$!</span> variable on failure. Other functions do
    not, except accidentally.</p>
<p class="Pp">Extension modules can also hook into the Perl parser to define new
    kinds of keyword-headed expression. These may look like functions, but may
    also look completely different. The syntax following the keyword is defined
    entirely by the extension. If you are an implementor, see
    &quot;PL_keyword_plugin&quot; in perlapi for the mechanism. If you are using
    such a module, see the module's documentation for details of the syntax that
    it defines.</p>

<p class="Pp">Here are Perl's functions (including things that look like
    functions, like some keywords and named operators) arranged by category.
    Some functions appear in more than one place. Any warnings, including those
    produced by keywords, are described in perldiag and warnings.</p>

  <dd>A file test, where X is one of the letters listed below. This unary
      operator takes one argument, either a filename, a filehandle, or a
      dirhandle, and tests the associated file to see if something is true about
      it. If the argument is omitted, tests <span class="Li">$_</span>, except
      for <span class="Li">&quot;-t&quot;</span>, which tests STDIN. Unless
      otherwise documented, it returns <span class="Li">1</span> for true and
      <span class="Li">''</span> for false. If the file doesn't exist or can't
      be examined, it returns <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> and sets
      <span class="Li">$!</span> (errno). With the exception of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;-l&quot;</span> test they all follow symbolic links
      because they use <span class="Li">&quot;stat()&quot;</span> and not
      <span class="Li">&quot;lstat()&quot;</span> (so dangling symlinks can't be
      examined and will therefore report failure).
    <p class="Pp">Despite the funny names, precedence is the same as any other
        named unary operator. The operator may be any of:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    -r  File is readable by effective uid/gid.
    -w  File is writable by effective uid/gid.
    -x  File is executable by effective uid/gid.
    -o  File is owned by effective uid.
    -R  File is readable by real uid/gid.
    -W  File is writable by real uid/gid.
    -X  File is executable by real uid/gid.
    -O  File is owned by real uid.
    -e  File exists.
    -z  File has zero size (is empty).
    -s  File has nonzero size (returns size in bytes).
    -f  File is a plain file.
    -d  File is a directory.
    -l  File is a symbolic link (false if symlinks aren't
        supported by the file system).
    -p  File is a named pipe (FIFO), or Filehandle is a pipe.
    -S  File is a socket.
    -b  File is a block special file.
    -c  File is a character special file.
    -t  Filehandle is opened to a tty.
    -u  File has setuid bit set.
    -g  File has setgid bit set.
    -k  File has sticky bit set.
    -T  File is an ASCII or UTF-8 text file (heuristic guess).
    -B  File is a &quot;binary&quot; file (opposite of -T).
    -M  Script start time minus file modification time, in days.
    -A  Same for access time.
    -C  Same for inode change time (Unix, may differ for other
        platforms)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        chomp;
        next unless -f $_;  # ignore specials
        #...
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that <span class="Li">&quot;-s/a/b/&quot;</span> does not
        do a negated substitution. Saying
        <span class="Li">&quot;-exp($foo)&quot;</span> still works as expected,
        however: only single letters following a minus are interpreted as file
        tests.</p>
    <p class="Pp">These operators are exempt from the &quot;looks like a
        function rule&quot; described above. That is, an opening parenthesis
        after the operator does not affect how much of the following code
        constitutes the argument. Put the opening parentheses before the
        operator to separate it from code that follows (this applies only to
        operators with higher precedence than unary operators, of course):</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    -s($file) + 1024   # probably wrong; same as -s($file + 1024)
    (-s $file) + 1024  # correct
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The interpretation of the file permission operators
        <span class="Li">&quot;-r&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;-R&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;-w&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;-W&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;-x&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-X&quot;</span> is by default based solely on the
        mode of the file and the uids and gids of the user. There may be other
        reasons you can't actually read, write, or execute the file: for example
        network filesystem access controls, ACLs (access control lists),
        read-only filesystems, and unrecognized executable formats. Note that
        the use of these six specific operators to verify if some operation is
        possible is usually a mistake, because it may be open to race
        conditions.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also note that, for the superuser on the local filesystems,
        the <span class="Li">&quot;-r&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;-R&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;-w&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-W&quot;</span> tests always return 1, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-x&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-X&quot;</span> return 1 if any execute bit is
        set in the mode. Scripts run by the superuser may thus need to do a
        <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span> to determine the actual mode of
        the file, or temporarily set their effective uid to something else.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you are using ACLs, there is a pragma called
        <span class="Li">&quot;filetest&quot;</span> that may produce more
        accurate results than the bare <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span>
        mode bits. When under <span class="Li">&quot;use filetest
        'access'&quot;</span>, the above-mentioned filetests test whether the
        permission can(not) be granted using the <b>access</b>(2) family of
        system calls. Also note that the <span class="Li">&quot;-x&quot;</span>
        and <span class="Li">&quot;-X&quot;</span> tests may under this pragma
        return true even if there are no execute permission bits set (nor any
        extra execute permission ACLs). This strangeness is due to the
        underlying system calls' definitions. Note also that, due to the
        implementation of <span class="Li">&quot;use filetest
        'access'&quot;</span>, the <span class="Li">&quot;_&quot;</span> special
        filehandle won't cache the results of the file tests when this pragma is
        in effect. Read the documentation for the
        <span class="Li">&quot;filetest&quot;</span> pragma for more
        information.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;-T&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-B&quot;</span> tests work as follows. The first
        block or so of the file is examined to see if it is valid UTF-8 that
        includes non-ASCII characters. If so, it's a
        <span class="Li">&quot;-T&quot;</span> file. Otherwise, that same
        portion of the file is examined for odd characters such as strange
        control codes or characters with the high bit set. If more than a third
        of the characters are strange, it's a
        <span class="Li">&quot;-B&quot;</span> file; otherwise it's a
        <span class="Li">&quot;-T&quot;</span> file. Also, any file containing a
        zero byte in the examined portion is considered a binary file. (If
        executed within the scope of a use&#x00A0;locale which includes
        <span class="Li">&quot;LC_CTYPE&quot;</span>, odd characters are
        anything that isn't a printable nor space in the current locale.) If
        <span class="Li">&quot;-T&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;-B&quot;</span> is used on a filehandle, the
        current IO buffer is examined rather than the first block. Both
        <span class="Li">&quot;-T&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-B&quot;</span> return true on an empty file, or
        a file at EOF when testing a filehandle. Because you have to read a file
        to do the <span class="Li">&quot;-T&quot;</span> test, on most occasions
        you want to use a <span class="Li">&quot;-f&quot;</span> against the
        file first, as in <span class="Li">&quot;next unless -f $file &amp;&amp;
        -T $file&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If any of the file tests (or either the
        <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;lstat&quot;</span> operator) is given the special
        filehandle consisting of a solitary underline, then the stat structure
        of the previous file test (or <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span>
        operator) is used, saving a system call. (This doesn't work with
        <span class="Li">&quot;-t&quot;</span>, and you need to remember that
        <span class="Li">&quot;lstat&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-l&quot;</span> leave values in the stat
        structure for the symbolic link, not the real file.) (Also, if the stat
        buffer was filled by an <span class="Li">&quot;lstat&quot;</span> call,
        <span class="Li">&quot;-T&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-B&quot;</span> will reset it with the results of
        <span class="Li">&quot;stat _&quot;</span>). Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    print &quot;Can do.\n&quot; if -r $a || -w _ || -x _;
    stat($filename);
    print &quot;Readable\n&quot; if -r _;
    print &quot;Writable\n&quot; if -w _;
    print &quot;Executable\n&quot; if -x _;
    print &quot;Setuid\n&quot; if -u _;
    print &quot;Setgid\n&quot; if -g _;
    print &quot;Sticky\n&quot; if -k _;
    print &quot;Text\n&quot; if -T _;
    print &quot;Binary\n&quot; if -B _;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.10.0, as a form of purely syntactic sugar, you
        can stack file test operators, in a way that <span class="Li">&quot;-f
        -w -x $file&quot;</span> is equivalent to <span class="Li">&quot;-x
        $file &amp;&amp; -w _ &amp;&amp; -f _&quot;</span>. (This is only fancy
        syntax: if you use the return value of <span class="Li">&quot;-f
        $file&quot;</span> as an argument to another filetest operator, no
        special magic will happen.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Portability issues: &quot;-X&quot; in perlport.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To avoid confusing would-be users of your code with mysterious
        syntax errors, put something like this at the top of your script:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use 5.010;  # so filetest ops can stack
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>abs VALUE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="abs"><a class="permalink" href="#abs">abs</a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the absolute value of its argument. If VALUE is omitted, uses
      <span class="Li">$_</span>.</dd>
  <dt id="accept"><a class="permalink" href="#accept">accept
    NEWSOCKET,GENERICSOCKET</a></dt>
  <dd>Accepts an incoming socket connect, just as <b>accept</b>(2) does. Returns
      the packed address if it succeeded, false otherwise. See the example in
      &quot;Sockets: Client/Server Communication&quot; in perlipc.
    <p class="Pp">On systems that support a close-on-exec flag on files, the

  <dt id="alarm"><a class="permalink" href="#alarm">alarm</a></dt>
  <dd>Arranges to have a SIGALRM delivered to this process after the specified
      number of wallclock seconds has elapsed. If SECONDS is not specified, the
      value stored in <span class="Li">$_</span> is used. (On some machines,
      unfortunately, the elapsed time may be up to one second less or more than
      you specified because of how seconds are counted, and process scheduling
      may delay the delivery of the signal even further.)
    <p class="Pp">Only one timer may be counting at once. Each call disables the
        previous timer, and an argument of <span class="Li">0</span> may be
        supplied to cancel the previous timer without starting a new one. The
        returned value is the amount of time remaining on the previous
      timer.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For delays of finer granularity than one second, the
        Time::HiRes module (from CPAN, and starting from Perl 5.8 part of the
        standard distribution) provides
        <span class="Li">&quot;ualarm&quot;</span>. You may also use Perl's
        four-argument version of <span class="Li">&quot;select&quot;</span>
        leaving the first three arguments undefined, or you might be able to use
        the <span class="Li">&quot;syscall&quot;</span> interface to access
        <b>setitimer</b>(2) if your system supports it. See perlfaq8 for
        details.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is usually a mistake to intermix
        <span class="Li">&quot;alarm&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;sleep&quot;</span> calls, because
        <span class="Li">&quot;sleep&quot;</span> may be internally implemented
        on your system with <span class="Li">&quot;alarm&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you want to use <span class="Li">&quot;alarm&quot;</span>
        to time out a system call you need to use an
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>
        pair. You can't rely on the alarm causing the system call to fail with
        <span class="Li">$!</span> set to
        <span class="Li">&quot;EINTR&quot;</span> because Perl sets up signal
        handlers to restart system calls on some systems. Using
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>

    FILEHANDLE</a></dt>
  <dd>Arranges for FILEHANDLE to be read or written in &quot;binary&quot; or
      &quot;text&quot; mode on systems where the run-time libraries distinguish
      between binary and text files. If FILEHANDLE is an expression, the value
      is taken as the name of the filehandle. Returns true on success, otherwise
      it returns <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> and sets
      <span class="Li">$!</span> (errno).
    <p class="Pp">On some systems (in general, DOS- and Windows-based systems)
        <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> is necessary when you're not
        working with a text file. For the sake of portability it is a good idea
        always to use it when appropriate, and never to use it when it isn't
        appropriate. Also, people can set their I/O to be by default
        UTF8-encoded Unicode, not bytes.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In other words: regardless of platform, use
        <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> on binary data, like images,
        for example.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If LAYER is present it is a single string, but may contain
        multiple directives. The directives alter the behaviour of the
        filehandle. When LAYER is present, using binmode on a text file makes
        sense.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If LAYER is omitted or specified as
        <span class="Li">&quot;:raw&quot;</span> the filehandle is made suitable
        for passing binary data. This includes turning off possible CRLF
        translation and marking it as bytes (as opposed to Unicode characters).
        Note that, despite what may be implied in <i>&quot;Programming
        Perl&quot;</i> (the Camel, 3rd edition) or elsewhere,
        <span class="Li">&quot;:raw&quot;</span> is <i>not</i> simply the
        inverse of <span class="Li">&quot;:crlf&quot;</span>. Other layers that
        would affect the binary nature of the stream are <i>also</i> disabled.
        See PerlIO, and the discussion about the PERLIO environment variable in
        perlrun.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;:bytes&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;:crlf&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span>, and any other directives of
        the form <span class="Li">&quot;:...&quot;</span>, are called I/O
        <i>layers</i>. The open pragma can be used to establish default I/O
        layers.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><i>The LAYER parameter of the
        </i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;binmode&quot;</i></span><i></i>
        <i>function is described as &quot;DISCIPLINE&quot; in &quot;Programming
        Perl, 3rd</i> <i>Edition&quot;. However, since the publishing of this
        book, by many known as</i> <i>&quot;Camel III&quot;, the consensus of
        the naming of this functionality has moved</i> <i>from
        &quot;discipline&quot; to &quot;layer&quot;. All documentation of this
        version of Perl</i> <i>therefore refers to &quot;layers&quot; rather
        than to &quot;disciplines&quot;. Now back to</i> <i>the regularly
        scheduled documentation...</i></p>
    <p class="Pp">To mark FILEHANDLE as UTF-8, use
        <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;</span>.
        <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> just marks the data as UTF-8
        without further checking, while
        <span class="Li">&quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;</span> checks the data for
        actually being valid UTF-8. More details can be found in
        PerlIO::encoding.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In general, <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> should
        be called after <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> but before any
        I/O is done on the filehandle. Calling
        <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> normally flushes any pending
        buffered output data (and perhaps pending input data) on the handle. An
        exception to this is the <span class="Li">&quot;:encoding&quot;</span>
        layer that changes the default character encoding of the handle. The
        <span class="Li">&quot;:encoding&quot;</span> layer sometimes needs to
        be called in mid-stream, and it doesn't flush the stream.
        <span class="Li">&quot;:encoding&quot;</span> also implicitly pushes on
        top of itself the <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> layer
        because internally Perl operates on UTF8-encoded Unicode characters.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The operating system, device drivers, C libraries, and Perl
        run-time system all conspire to let the programmer treat a single
        character (<span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span>) as the line
        terminator, irrespective of external representation. On many operating
        systems, the native text file representation matches the internal
        representation, but on some platforms the external representation of
        <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> is made up of more than one
        character.</p>
    <p class="Pp">All variants of Unix, Mac OS (old and new), and Stream_LF
        files on VMS use a single character to end each line in the external
        representation of text (even though that single character is CARRIAGE
        RETURN on old, pre-Darwin flavors of Mac OS, and is LINE FEED on Unix
        and most VMS files). In other systems like OS/2, DOS, and the various
        flavors of MS-Windows, your program sees a
        <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> as a simple
        <span class="Li">&quot;\cJ&quot;</span>, but what's stored in text files
        are the two characters <span class="Li">&quot;\cM\cJ&quot;</span>. That
        means that if you don't use <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span>
        on these systems, <span class="Li">&quot;\cM\cJ&quot;</span> sequences
        on disk will be converted to <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> on
        input, and any <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span> in your program
        will be converted back to <span class="Li">&quot;\cM\cJ&quot;</span> on
        output. This is what you want for text files, but it can be disastrous
        for binary files.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Another consequence of using
        <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> (on some systems) is that
        special end-of-file markers will be seen as part of the data stream. For
        systems from the Microsoft family this means that, if your binary data
        contain <span class="Li">&quot;\cZ&quot;</span>, the I/O subsystem will
        regard it as the end of the file, unless you use
        <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> is important not
        only for <span class="Li">&quot;readline&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span> operations, but also when
        using <span class="Li">&quot;read&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysread&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;syswrite&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span> (see perlport for more
        details). See the <span class="Li">$/</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;$\&quot;</span> variables in perlvar for how to
        manually set your input and output line-termination sequences.</p>

        <span class="Li">$evaltext</span> contains the text of the

        <span class="Li">$hints</span> and <span class="Li">$bitmask</span>
        contain pragmatic hints that the caller was compiled with.
        <span class="Li">$hints</span> corresponds to
        <span class="Li">$^H</span>, and <span class="Li">$bitmask</span>
        corresponds to <span class="Li">&quot;${^WARNING_BITS}&quot;</span>. The

        values are subject to change between versions of Perl, and are not meant

    <p class="Pp">Note that the only types of call frames that are visible are
        subroutine calls and <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>. Other
        forms of context, such as <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> or

    <p class="Pp">Furthermore, when called from within the DB package in list
        context, and with an argument, caller returns more detailed information:
        it sets the list variable <span class="Li">@DB::args</span> to be the

    <p class="Pp">Be aware that the optimizer might have optimized call frames
        away before <span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span> had a chance to
        get the information. That means that <span class="Li">caller(N)</span>
        might not return information about the call frame you expect it to, for
        <span class="Li">&quot;N &gt; 1&quot;</span>. In particular,
        <span class="Li">@DB::args</span> might have information from the
        previous time <span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span> was called.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Be aware that setting <span class="Li">@DB::args</span> is
        <i>best effort</i>, intended for debugging or generating backtraces, and
        should not be relied upon. In particular, as <span class="Li">@_</span>
        contains aliases to the caller's arguments, Perl does not take a copy of
        <span class="Li">@_</span>, so <span class="Li">@DB::args</span> will
        contain modifications the subroutine makes to <span class="Li">@_</span>
        or its contents, not the original values at call time.
        <span class="Li">@DB::args</span>, like <span class="Li">@_</span>, does
        not hold explicit references to its elements, so under certain cases its
        elements may have become freed and reallocated for other variables or
        temporary values. Finally, a side effect of the current implementation
        is that the effects of <span class="Li">&quot;shift @_&quot;</span> can
        <i>normally</i> be undone (but not <span class="Li">&quot;pop
        @_&quot;</span> or other splicing, <i>and</i> not if a reference to
        <span class="Li">@_</span> has been taken, <i>and</i> subject to the
        caveat about reallocated elements), so <span class="Li">@DB::args</span>
        is actually a hybrid of the current state and initial state of
        <span class="Li">@_</span>. Buyer beware.</p>

      remove the newline from the end of an input record when you're worried
      that the final record may be missing its newline. When in paragraph mode
      (<span class="Li">&quot;$/ = ''&quot;</span>), it removes all trailing

      Closes the currently selected filehandle if the argument is omitted.
    <p class="Pp">You don't have to close FILEHANDLE if you are immediately

        line counter (<span class="Li">$.</span>), while the implicit close done
        by <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> does not.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the filehandle came from a piped open,
        <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span> returns false if one of the

        <span class="Li">$!</span> will be set to <span class="Li">0</span>.
        Closing a pipe also waits for the process executing on the pipe to
        exit--in case you wish to look at the output of the pipe afterwards--and
        implicitly puts the exit status value of that command into
        <span class="Li">$?</span> and

    <p class="Pp">Closing the read end of a pipe before the process writing to
        it at the other end is done writing results in the writer receiving a
        SIGPIPE. If the other end can't handle that, be sure to read all the
        data before closing the pipe.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    open(OUTPUT, '|sort &gt;foo')  # pipe to sort

      (typically in a <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span>), it is always executed just
      before the conditional is about to be evaluated again, just like the third
      part of a <span class="Li">&quot;for&quot;</span> loop in C. Thus it can
      be used to increment a loop variable, even when the loop has been
      continued via the <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span> statement
      (which is similar to the C <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span>
      statement).
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>, or

        <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>, but since it will execute a

    <p class="Pp">Omitting the <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span>

        <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span> goes directly back to check the
        condition at the top of the loop.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When there is no BLOCK,
        <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span> is a function that falls
        through the current <span class="Li">&quot;when&quot;</span> or

    PLAINTEXT,SALT</a></dt>
  <dd>Creates a digest string exactly like the <b>crypt</b>(3) function in the C
      library (assuming that you actually have a version there that has not been
      extirpated as a potential munition).
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;crypt&quot;</span> is a one-way hash
        function. The PLAINTEXT and SALT are turned into a short string, called
        a digest, which is returned. The same PLAINTEXT and SALT will always
        return the same string, but there is no (known) way to get the original
        PLAINTEXT from the hash. Small changes in the PLAINTEXT or SALT will
        result in large changes in the digest.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There is no decrypt function. This function isn't all that
        useful for cryptography (for that, look for <i>Crypt</i> modules on your
        nearby CPAN mirror) and the name &quot;crypt&quot; is a bit of a
        misnomer. Instead it is primarily used to check if two pieces of text
        are the same without having to transmit or store the text itself. An
        example is checking if a correct password is given. The digest of the
        password is stored, not the password itself. The user types in a
        password that is <span class="Li">&quot;crypt&quot;</span>'d with the
        same salt as the stored digest. If the two digests match, the password
        is correct.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When verifying an existing digest string you should use the
        digest as the salt (like <span class="Li">&quot;crypt($plain, $digest)
        eq $digest&quot;</span>). The SALT used to create the digest is visible
        as part of the digest. This ensures
        <span class="Li">&quot;crypt&quot;</span> will hash the new string with
        the same salt as the digest. This allows your code to work with the
        standard <span class="Li">&quot;crypt&quot;</span> and with more exotic
        implementations. In other words, assume nothing about the returned
        string itself nor about how many bytes of SALT may matter.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Traditionally the result is a string of 13 bytes: two first
        bytes of the salt, followed by 11 bytes from the set
        <span class="Li">&quot;[./0-9A-Za-z]&quot;</span>, and only the first
        eight bytes of PLAINTEXT mattered. But alternative hashing schemes (like
        MD5), higher level security schemes (like C2), and implementations on
        non-Unix platforms may produce different strings.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When choosing a new salt create a random two character string
        whose characters come from the set
        <span class="Li">&quot;[./0-9A-Za-z]&quot;</span> (like
        <span class="Li">&quot;join '', ('.',</span> <span class="Li">'/', 0..9,
        'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z')[rand 64, rand 64]&quot;</span>). This set of
        characters is just a recommendation; the characters allowed in the salt
        depend solely on your system's crypt library, and Perl can't restrict
        what salts <span class="Li">&quot;crypt&quot;</span> accepts.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here's an example that makes sure that whoever runs this
        program knows their password:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $pwd = (getpwuid($&lt;))[1];
    system &quot;stty -echo&quot;;
    print &quot;Password: &quot;;
    chomp(my $word = &lt;STDIN&gt;);
    print &quot;\n&quot;;
    system &quot;stty echo&quot;;
    if (crypt($word, $pwd) ne $pwd) {
        die &quot;Sorry...\n&quot;;
    } else {
        print &quot;ok\n&quot;;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Of course, typing in your own password to whoever asks you for
        it is unwise.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;crypt&quot;</span> function is
        unsuitable for hashing large quantities of data, not least of all
        because you can't get the information back. Look at the Digest module
        for more robust algorithms.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If using <span class="Li">&quot;crypt&quot;</span> on a
        Unicode string (which <i>potentially</i> has characters with codepoints
        above 255), Perl tries to make sense of the situation by trying to
        downgrade (a copy of) the string back to an eight-bit byte string before
        calling <span class="Li">&quot;crypt&quot;</span> (on that copy). If
        that works, good. If not, <span class="Li">&quot;crypt&quot;</span> dies
        with <span class="Li">&quot;Wide character in crypt&quot;</span>.</p>

        argument is <i>not</i> a filehandle, even though it looks like one).
        DBNAME is the name of the database (without the <i>.dir</i> or
        <i>.pag</i> extension if any). If the database does not exist, it is
        created with protection specified by MASK (as modified by the
        <span class="Li">&quot;umask&quot;</span>). To prevent creation of the
        database if it doesn't exist, you may specify a MODE of 0, and the
        function will return a false value if it can't find an existing
        database. If your system supports only the older DBM functions, you may
        make only one <span class="Li">&quot;dbmopen&quot;</span> call in your
        program. In older versions of Perl, if your system had neither DBM nor
        ndbm, calling <span class="Li">&quot;dbmopen&quot;</span> produced a
        fatal error; it now falls back to <b>sdbm</b>(3).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you don't have write access to the DBM file, you can only
        read hash variables, not set them. If you want to test whether you can
        write, either use file tests or try setting a dummy hash entry inside an
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> to trap the error.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that functions such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;values&quot;</span> may return huge lists when
        used on large DBM files. You may prefer to use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> function to iterate over large
        DBM files. Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # print out history file offsets
    dbmopen(%HIST,'/usr/lib/news/history',0666);
    while (($key,$val) = each %HIST) {
        print $key, ' = ', unpack('L',$val), &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
    dbmclose(%HIST);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">See also AnyDBM_File for a more general description of the
        pros and cons of the various dbm approaches, as well as DB_File for a
        particularly rich implementation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can control which DBM library you use by loading that
        library before you call <span class="Li">&quot;dbmopen&quot;</span>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use DB_File;
    dbmopen(%NS_Hist, &quot;$ENV{HOME}/.netscape/history.db&quot;)
        or die &quot;Can't open netscape history file: $!&quot;;

  <dt>defined EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="defined"><a class="permalink" href="#defined">defined</a></dt>
  <dd>Returns a Boolean value telling whether EXPR has a value other than the
      undefined value <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>. If EXPR is not
      present, <span class="Li">$_</span> is checked.
    <p class="Pp">Many operations return
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> to indicate failure, end of
        file, system error, uninitialized variable, and other exceptional
        conditions. This function allows you to distinguish
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> from other values. (A simple
        Boolean test will not distinguish among
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>, zero, the empty string, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;0&quot;</span>, which are all equally false.)
        Note that since <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> is a valid
        scalar, its presence doesn't <i>necessarily</i> indicate an exceptional
        condition: <span class="Li">&quot;pop&quot;</span> returns
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> when its argument is an empty
        array, <i>or</i> when the element to return happens to be
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You may also use
        <span class="Li">&quot;defined(&amp;func)&quot;</span> to check whether
        subroutine <span class="Li">&quot;func&quot;</span> has ever been
        defined. The return value is unaffected by any forward declarations of
        <span class="Li">&quot;func&quot;</span>. A subroutine that is not
        defined may still be callable: its package may have an
        <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> method that makes it spring
        into existence the first time that it is called; see perlsub.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Use of <span class="Li">&quot;defined&quot;</span> on
        aggregates (hashes and arrays) is no longer supported. It used to report
        whether memory for that aggregate had ever been allocated. You should
        instead use a simple test for size:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    if (@an_array) { print &quot;has array elements\n&quot; }
    if (%a_hash)   { print &quot;has hash members\n&quot;   }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">When used on a hash element, it tells you whether the value is
        defined, not whether the key exists in the hash. Use
        <span class="Li">&quot;exists&quot;</span> for the latter purpose.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    print if defined $switch{D};
    print &quot;$val\n&quot; while defined($val = pop(@ary));
    die &quot;Can't readlink $sym: $!&quot;
        unless defined($value = readlink $sym);
    sub foo { defined &amp;$bar ? $bar-&gt;(@_) : die &quot;No bar&quot;; }
    $debugging = 0 unless defined $debugging;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note: Many folks tend to overuse
        <span class="Li">&quot;defined&quot;</span> and are then surprised to
        discover that the number <span class="Li">0</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span> (the zero-length string) are, in
        fact, defined values. For example, if you say</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    &quot;ab&quot; =~ /a(.*)b/;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The pattern match succeeds and <span class="Li">$1</span> is
        defined, although it matched &quot;nothing&quot;. It didn't really fail
        to match anything. Rather, it matched something that happened to be zero
        characters long. This is all very above-board and honest. When a
        function returns an undefined value, it's an admission that it couldn't
        give you an honest answer. So you should use
        <span class="Li">&quot;defined&quot;</span> only when questioning the
        integrity of what you're trying to do. At other times, a simple
        comparison to <span class="Li">0</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span> is what you want.</p>

  <dt id="delete"><a class="permalink" href="#delete">delete EXPR</a></dt>
  <dd>Given an expression that specifies an element or slice of a hash,
      <span class="Li">&quot;delete&quot;</span> deletes the specified elements
      from that hash so that <span class="Li">&quot;exists&quot;</span> on that
      element no longer returns true. Setting a hash element to the undefined
      value does not remove its key, but deleting it does; see
      <span class="Li">&quot;exists&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">In list context, usually returns the value or values deleted,
        or the last such element in scalar context. The return list's length
        corresponds to that of the argument list: deleting non-existent elements
        returns the undefined value in their corresponding positions. When a
        key/value hash slice is passed to
        <span class="Li">&quot;delete&quot;</span>, the return value is a list
        of key/value pairs (two elements for each item deleted from the
      hash).</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;delete&quot;</span> may also be used on
        arrays and array slices, but its behavior is less straightforward.
        Although <span class="Li">&quot;exists&quot;</span> will return false
        for deleted entries, deleting array elements never changes indices of
        existing values; use <span class="Li">&quot;shift&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;splice&quot;</span> for that. However, if any
        deleted elements fall at the end of an array, the array's size shrinks
        to the position of the highest element that still tests true for
        <span class="Li">&quot;exists&quot;</span>, or to 0 if none do. In other
        words, an array won't have trailing nonexistent elements after a
      delete.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>WARNING:</b> Calling
        <span class="Li">&quot;delete&quot;</span> on array values is strongly
        discouraged. The notion of deleting or checking the existence of Perl
        array elements is not conceptually coherent, and can lead to surprising
        behavior.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Deleting from <span class="Li">%ENV</span> modifies the
        environment. Deleting from a hash tied to a DBM file deletes the entry
        from the DBM file. Deleting from a
        <span class="Li">&quot;tied&quot;</span> hash or array may not
        necessarily return anything; it depends on the implementation of the
        <span class="Li">&quot;tied&quot;</span> package's DELETE method, which
        may do whatever it pleases.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;delete local EXPR&quot;</span>
        construct localizes the deletion to the current block at run time. Until
        the block exits, elements locally deleted temporarily no longer exist.
        See &quot;Localized deletion of elements of composite types&quot; in
        perlsub.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my %hash = (foo =&gt; 11, bar =&gt; 22, baz =&gt; 33);
    my $scalar = delete $hash{foo};         # $scalar is 11
    $scalar = delete @hash{qw(foo bar)}; # $scalar is 22
    my @array  = delete @hash{qw(foo baz)}; # @array  is (undef,33)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The following (inefficiently) deletes all the values of
        <span class="Li">%HASH</span> and <span class="Li">@ARRAY:</span></p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>

    }
    foreach my $index (0 .. $#ARRAY) {

    }

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    delete @HASH{keys %HASH};
    delete @ARRAY[0 .. $#ARRAY];
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">But both are slower than assigning the empty list or
        undefining <span class="Li">%HASH</span> or
        <span class="Li">@ARRAY</span>, which is the customary way to empty out
        an aggregate:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>

    <p class="Pp">The EXPR can be arbitrarily complicated provided its final

    delete $ref-&gt;[$x][$y]-&gt;@{$key1, $key2, @morekeys};

  <dt id="die"><a class="permalink" href="#die">die LIST</a></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span> raises an exception. Inside an
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> the exception is stuffed into
      <span class="Li">$@</span> and the
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> is terminated with the undefined
      value. If the exception is outside of all enclosing
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>s, then the uncaught exception is
      printed to <span class="Li">&quot;STDERR&quot;</span> and perl exits with
      an exit code indicating failure. If you need to exit the process with a
      specific exit code, see <span class="Li">&quot;exit&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Equivalent examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    die &quot;Can't cd to spool: $!\n&quot; unless chdir '/usr/spool/news';
    chdir '/usr/spool/news' or die &quot;Can't cd to spool: $!\n&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Most of the time, <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span> is
        called with a string to use as the exception. You may either give a
        single non-reference operand to serve as the exception, or a list of two
        or more items, which will be stringified and concatenated to make the
        exception.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the string exception does not end in a newline, the current
        script line number and input line number (if any) and a newline are
        appended to it. Note that the &quot;input line number&quot; (also known
        as &quot;chunk&quot;) is subject to whatever notion of &quot;line&quot;
        happens to be currently in effect, and is also available as the special
        variable <span class="Li">$.</span>. See &quot;$/&quot; in perlvar and
        &quot;$.&quot; in perlvar.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Hint: sometimes appending <span class="Li">&quot;,
        stopped&quot;</span> to your message will cause it to make better sense
        when the string <span class="Li">&quot;at foo line 123&quot;</span> is
        appended. Suppose you are running script &quot;canasta&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>

    <p class="Pp">If LIST was empty or made an empty string, and
        <span class="Li">$@</span> already contains an exception value
        (typically from a previous <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>),
        then that value is reused after appending
        <span class="Li">&quot;\t...propagated&quot;</span>. This is useful for
        propagating exceptions:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    eval { ... };
    die unless $@ =~ /Expected exception/;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If LIST was empty or made an empty string, and
        <span class="Li">$@</span> contains an object reference that has a
        <span class="Li">&quot;PROPAGATE&quot;</span> method, that method will
        be called with additional file and line number parameters. The return
        value replaces the value in <span class="Li">$@</span>; i.e., as if
        <span class="Li">&quot;$@ = eval { $@-&gt;PROPAGATE(__FILE__, __LINE__)
        };&quot;</span> were called.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If LIST was empty or made an empty string, and
        <span class="Li">$@</span> is also empty, then the string
        <span class="Li">&quot;Died&quot;</span> is used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can also call <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span> with
        a reference argument, and if this is trapped within an
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">$@</span>
        contains that reference. This permits more elaborate exception handling
        using objects that maintain arbitrary state about the exception. Such a
        scheme is sometimes preferable to matching particular string values of
        <span class="Li">$@</span> with regular expressions.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Because Perl stringifies uncaught exception messages before
        display, you'll probably want to overload stringification operations on
        exception objects. See overload for details about that. The stringified
        message should be non-empty, and should end in a newline, in order to
        fit in with the treatment of string exceptions. Also, because an
        exception object reference cannot be stringified without destroying it,
        Perl doesn't attempt to append location or other information to a
        reference exception. If you want location information with a complex
        exception object, you'll have to arrange to put the location information
        into the object yourself.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Because <span class="Li">$@</span> is a global variable, be
        careful that analyzing an exception caught by
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> doesn't replace the reference
        in the global variable. It's easiest to make a local copy of the
        reference before any manipulations. Here's an example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Scalar::Util &quot;blessed&quot;;
    eval { ... ; die Some::Module::Exception-&gt;new( FOO =&gt; &quot;bar&quot; ) };
    if (my $ev_err = $@) {
        if (blessed($ev_err)
            &amp;&amp; $ev_err-&gt;isa(&quot;Some::Module::Exception&quot;)) {
            # handle Some::Module::Exception
        }
        else {
            # handle all other possible exceptions
        }
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If an uncaught exception results in interpreter exit, the exit
        code is determined from the values of <span class="Li">$!</span> and
        <span class="Li">$?</span> with this pseudocode:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    exit $! if $!;              # errno
    exit $? &gt;&gt; 8 if $? &gt;&gt; 8;    # child exit status
    exit 255;                   # last resort
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">As with <span class="Li">&quot;exit&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">$?</span> is set prior to unwinding the call stack; any
        <span class="Li">&quot;DESTROY&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;END&quot;</span> handlers can then alter this
        value, and thus Perl's exit code.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The intent is to squeeze as much possible information about
        the likely cause into the limited space of the system exit code.
        However, as <span class="Li">$!</span> is the value of C's
        <span class="Li">&quot;errno&quot;</span>, which can be set by any
        system call, this means that the value of the exit code used by
        <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span> can be non-predictable, so
        should not be relied upon, other than to be non-zero.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can arrange for a callback to be run just before the
        <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span> does its deed, by setting the
        <span class="Li">$SIG{__DIE__}</span> hook. The associated handler is
        called with the exception as an argument, and can change the exception,
        if it sees fit, by calling <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>
        again. See &quot;%SIG&quot; in perlvar for details on setting
        <span class="Li">%SIG</span> entries, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> for some examples. Although
        this feature was to be run only right before your program was to exit,
        this is not currently so: the <span class="Li">$SIG{__DIE__}</span> hook
        is currently called even inside
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>ed blocks/strings! If one wants
        the hook to do nothing in such situations, put</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    die @_ if $^S;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">as the first line of the handler (see &quot;$^S&quot; in
        perlvar). Because this promotes strange action at a distance, this
        counterintuitive behavior may be fixed in a future release.</p>

  <dd>This function causes an immediate core dump. See also the <b>-u</b>
      command-line switch in perlrun, which does the same thing. Primarily this
      is so that you can use the <b>undump</b> program (not supplied) to turn
      your core dump into an executable binary after having initialized all your
      variables at the beginning of the program. When the new binary is executed
      it will begin by executing a <span class="Li">&quot;goto
      LABEL&quot;</span> (with all the restrictions that
      <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span> suffers). Think of it as a goto
      with an intervening core dump and reincarnation. If
      <span class="Li">&quot;LABEL&quot;</span> is omitted, restarts the program
      from the top. The <span class="Li">&quot;dump EXPR&quot;</span> form,
      available starting in Perl 5.18.0, allows a name to be computed at run
      time, being otherwise identical to <span class="Li">&quot;dump
      LABEL&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>: Any files opened at the time of the dump will
        <i>not</i> be open any more when the program is reincarnated, with
        possible resulting confusion by Perl.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This function is now largely obsolete, mostly because it's
        very hard to convert a core file into an executable. As of Perl 5.30, it
        must be invoked as <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::dump()&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unlike most named operators, this has the same precedence as
        assignment. It is also exempt from the looks-like-a-function rule, so
        <span class="Li">&quot;dump
        (&quot;foo&quot;).&quot;bar&quot;&quot;</span> will cause
        &quot;bar&quot; to be part of the argument to

  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="each~2"><a class="permalink" href="#each~2">each ARRAY</a></dt>
  <dd>When called on a hash in list context, returns a 2-element list consisting
      of the key and value for the next element of a hash. In Perl 5.12 and
      later only, it will also return the index and value for the next element
      of an array so that you can iterate over it; older Perls consider this a
      syntax error. When called in scalar context, returns only the key (not the
      value) in a hash, or the index in an array.
    <p class="Pp">Hash entries are returned in an apparently random order. The
        actual random order is specific to a given hash; the exact same series
        of operations on two hashes may result in a different order for each
        hash. Any insertion into the hash may change the order, as will any
        deletion, with the exception that the most recent key returned by
        <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span> may be deleted without changing
        the order. So long as a given hash is unmodified you may rely on
        <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;values&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> to repeatedly return the same
        order as each other. See &quot;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&quot; in
        perlsec for details on why hash order is randomized. Aside from the
        guarantees provided here the exact details of Perl's hash algorithm and
        the hash traversal order are subject to change in any release of
      Perl.</p>
    <p class="Pp">After <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> has returned
        all entries from the hash or array, the next call to
        <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> returns the empty list in list
        context and <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> in scalar context;
        the next call following <i>that</i> one restarts iteration. Each hash or
        array has its own internal iterator, accessed by
        <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;values&quot;</span>. The iterator is implicitly
        reset when <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> has reached the end
        as just described; it can be explicitly reset by calling
        <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;values&quot;</span> on the hash or array, or by
        referencing the hash (but not array) in list context. If you add or
        delete a hash's elements while iterating over it, the effect on the
        iterator is unspecified; for example, entries may be skipped or
        duplicated--so don't do that. Exception: It is always safe to delete the
        item most recently returned by <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span>,
        so the following code works properly:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    while (my ($key, $value) = each %hash) {
        print $key, &quot;\n&quot;;
        delete $hash{$key};   # This is safe
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Tied hashes may have a different ordering behaviour to perl's
        hash implementation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The iterator used by <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span>
        is attached to the hash or array, and is shared between all iteration
        operations applied to the same hash or array. Thus all uses of
        <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> on a single hash or array
        advance the same iterator location. All uses of
        <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> are also subject to having the
        iterator reset by any use of <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;values&quot;</span> on the same hash or array, or
        by the hash (but not array) being referenced in list context. This makes
        <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span>-based loops quite fragile: it
        is easy to arrive at such a loop with the iterator already part way
        through the object, or to accidentally clobber the iterator state during
        execution of the loop body. It's easy enough to explicitly reset the
        iterator before starting a loop, but there is no way to insulate the
        iterator state used by a loop from the iterator state used by anything
        else that might execute during the loop body. To avoid these problems,
        use a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop rather than
        <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span>-<span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This prints out your environment like the <b>printenv</b>(1)
        program, but in a different order:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>

        print &quot;$key=$value\n&quot;;
    }

    <p class="Pp">Starting with Perl 5.14, an experimental feature allowed
        <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> to take a scalar expression.
        This experiment has been deemed unsuccessful, and was removed as of Perl
        5.24.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.18 you can use a bare
        <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> in a
        <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> loop, which will set
        <span class="Li">$_</span> on every iteration. If either an
        <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> expression or an explicit
        assignment of an <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> expression to
        a scalar is used as a
        <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;for&quot;</span>
        condition, then the condition actually tests for definedness of the
        expression's value, not for its regular truth value.</p>

  <dt>eof FILEHANDLE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>eof ()</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="eof"><a class="permalink" href="#eof">eof</a></dt>
  <dd>Returns 1 if the next read on FILEHANDLE will return end of file <i>or</i>
      if FILEHANDLE is not open. FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value
      gives the real filehandle. (Note that this function actually reads a
      character and then <span class="Li">&quot;ungetc&quot;</span>s it, so
      isn't useful in an interactive context.) Do not read from a terminal file
      (or call <span class="Li">&quot;eof(FILEHANDLE)&quot;</span> on it) after
      end-of-file is reached. File types such as terminals may lose the
      end-of-file condition if you do.
    <p class="Pp">An <span class="Li">&quot;eof&quot;</span> without an argument
        uses the last file read. Using <span class="Li">&quot;eof()&quot;</span>
        with empty parentheses is different. It refers to the pseudo file formed
        from the files listed on the command line and accessed via the
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> operator. Since
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> isn't explicitly opened, as
        a normal filehandle is, an <span class="Li">&quot;eof()&quot;</span>
        before <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> has been used will
        cause <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> to be examined to determine if input
        is available. Similarly, an <span class="Li">&quot;eof()&quot;</span>
        after <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> has returned
        end-of-file will assume you are processing another
        <span class="Li">@ARGV</span> list, and if you haven't set
        <span class="Li">@ARGV</span>, will read input from
        <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span>; see &quot;I/O Operators&quot;
        in perlop.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In a <span class="Li">&quot;while (&lt;&gt;)&quot;</span>
        loop, <span class="Li">&quot;eof&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;eof(ARGV)&quot;</span> can be used to detect the
        end of each file, whereas <span class="Li">&quot;eof()&quot;</span> will
        detect the end of the very last file only. Examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # reset line numbering on each input file
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        next if /^\s*#/;  # skip comments
        print &quot;$.\t$_&quot;;
    } continue {
        close ARGV if eof;  # Not eof()!
    }
    # insert dashes just before last line of last file
    while (&lt;&gt;) {
        if (eof()) {  # check for end of last file
            print &quot;--------------\n&quot;;
        }
        print;
        last if eof();     # needed if we're reading from a terminal
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Practical hint: you almost never need to use
        <span class="Li">&quot;eof&quot;</span> in Perl, because the input
        operators typically return <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>
        when they run out of data or encounter an error.</p>

  <dt>eval EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>eval BLOCK</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="eval"><a class="permalink" href="#eval">eval</a></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> in all its forms is used to
      execute a little Perl program, trapping any errors encountered so they
      don't crash the calling program.
    <p class="Pp">Plain <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> with no
        argument is just <span class="Li">&quot;eval EXPR&quot;</span>, where
        the expression is understood to be contained in
        <span class="Li">$_</span>. Thus there are only two real
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> forms; the one with an EXPR is
        often called &quot;string eval&quot;. In a string eval, the value of the
        expression (which is itself determined within scalar context) is first
        parsed, and if there were no errors, executed as a block within the
        lexical context of the current Perl program. This form is typically used
        to delay parsing and subsequent execution of the text of EXPR until run
        time. Note that the value is parsed every time the
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> executes.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The other form is called &quot;block eval&quot;. It is less
        general than string eval, but the code within the BLOCK is parsed only
        once (at the same time the code surrounding the
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> itself was parsed) and executed
        within the context of the current Perl program. This form is typically
        used to trap exceptions more efficiently than the first, while also
        providing the benefit of checking the code within BLOCK at compile time.
        BLOCK is parsed and compiled just once. Since errors are trapped, it
        often is used to check if a given feature is available.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In both forms, the value returned is the value of the last
        expression evaluated inside the mini-program; a return statement may
        also be used, just as with subroutines. The expression providing the
        return value is evaluated in void, scalar, or list context, depending on
        the context of the <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> itself. See
        <span class="Li">&quot;wantarray&quot;</span> for more on how the
        evaluation context can be determined.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If there is a syntax error or runtime error, or a
        <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span> statement is executed,
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> returns
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> in scalar context, or an empty
        list in list context, and <span class="Li">$@</span> is set to the error
        message. (Prior to 5.16, a bug caused
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> to be returned in list context
        for syntax errors, but not for runtime errors.) If there was no error,
        <span class="Li">$@</span> is set to the empty string. A control flow
        operator like <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span> can bypass the setting of
        <span class="Li">$@</span>. Beware that using
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> neither silences Perl from
        printing warnings to STDERR, nor does it stuff the text of warning
        messages into <span class="Li">$@</span>. To do either of those, you
        have to use the <span class="Li">$SIG{__WARN__}</span> facility, or turn
        off warnings inside the BLOCK or EXPR using
        <span class="Li">&quot;no&#x00A0;warnings&#x00A0;'all'&quot;</span>. See
        <span class="Li">&quot;warn&quot;</span>, perlvar, and warnings.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that, because <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>
        traps otherwise-fatal errors, it is useful for determining whether a
        particular feature (such as <span class="Li">&quot;socket&quot;</span>
        or <span class="Li">&quot;symlink&quot;</span>) is implemented. It is
        also Perl's exception-trapping mechanism, where the
        <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span> operator is used to raise
        exceptions.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Before Perl 5.14, the assignment to <span class="Li">$@</span>
        occurred before restoration of localized variables, which means that for
        your code to run on older versions, a temporary is required if you want
        to mask some, but not all errors:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> # alter $@ on nefarious repugnancy only
 {
    my $e;
    {
      local $@; # protect existing $@
      eval { test_repugnancy() };
      # $@ =~ /nefarious/ and die $@; # Perl 5.14 and higher only
      $@ =~ /nefarious/ and $e = $@;
    }
    die $e if defined $e
 }

      is considered to be in the same encoding as the surrounding program. Thus
      if <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;utf8&quot;</span> is in effect, the
      string will be treated as being UTF-8 encoded. Otherwise, the string is
      considered to be a sequence of independent bytes. Bytes that correspond to
      ASCII-range code points will have their normal meanings for operators in
      the string. The treatment of the other bytes depends on if the
      <span class="Li">&quot;'unicode_strings&quot;&quot;</span> feature is in
      effect.
    <p class="Pp">In a plain <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> without an

    <p class="Pp">Variables defined outside the

    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;evalbytes&quot;</span> fixes that to
        work the way one would expect:</p>

<p class="Pp">Problems can arise if the string expands a scalar containing a
    floating point number. That scalar can expand to letters, such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;Infinity&quot;</span>; or, within the scope of a
    <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span>, the decimal point character
    may be something other than a dot (such as a comma). None of these are
    likely to parse as you are likely expecting.</p>
<p class="Pp">You should be especially careful to remember what's being looked
    at when:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    eval $x;        # CASE 1
    eval &quot;$x&quot;;      # CASE 2
    eval '$x';      # CASE 3
    eval { $x };    # CASE 4
    eval &quot;\$$x++&quot;;  # CASE 5
    $$x++;          # CASE 6
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Cases 1 and 2 above behave identically: they run the code
    contained in the variable <span class="Li">$x</span>. (Although case 2 has
    misleading double quotes making the reader wonder what else might be
    happening (nothing is).) Cases 3 and 4 likewise behave in the same way: they
    run the code <span class="Li">'$x'</span>, which does nothing but return the
    value of <span class="Li">$x</span>. (Case 4 is preferred for purely visual
    reasons, but it also has the advantage of compiling at compile-time instead
    of at run-time.) Case 5 is a place where normally you <i>would</i> like to
    use double quotes, except that in this particular situation, you can just
    use symbolic references instead, as in case 6.</p>
<p class="Pp">An <span class="Li">&quot;eval ''&quot;</span> executed within a
    subroutine defined in the <span class="Li">&quot;DB&quot;</span> package
    doesn't see the usual surrounding lexical scope, but rather the scope of the
    first non-DB piece of code that called it. You don't normally need to worry
    about this unless you are writing a Perl debugger.</p>

  <dd>If the code to be executed doesn't vary, you may use the eval-BLOCK form
      to trap run-time errors without incurring the penalty of recompiling each
      time. The error, if any, is still returned in <span class="Li">$@</span>.
      Examples:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # make divide-by-zero nonfatal
    eval { $answer = $a / $b; }; warn $@ if $@;
    # same thing, but less efficient
    eval '$answer = $a / $b'; warn $@ if $@;
    # a compile-time error
    eval { $answer = }; # WRONG
    # a run-time error
    eval '$answer =';   # sets $@
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you want to trap errors when loading an XS module, some
        problems with the binary interface (such as Perl version skew) may be
        fatal even with <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> unless
        <span class="Li">$ENV{PERL_DL_NONLAZY}</span> is set. See perlrun.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Using the <span class="Li">&quot;eval {}&quot;</span> form as
        an exception trap in libraries does have some issues. Due to the current
        arguably broken state of <span class="Li">&quot;__DIE__&quot;</span>
        hooks, you may wish not to trigger any
        <span class="Li">&quot;__DIE__&quot;</span> hooks that user code may
        have installed. You can use the <span class="Li">&quot;local
        $SIG{__DIE__}&quot;</span> construct for this purpose, as this example
        shows:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # a private exception trap for divide-by-zero
    eval { local $SIG{'__DIE__'}; $answer = $a / $b; };
    warn $@ if $@;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This is especially significant, given that
        <span class="Li">&quot;__DIE__&quot;</span> hooks can call
        <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span> again, which has the effect of
        changing their error messages:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # __DIE__ hooks may modify error messages
    {
       local $SIG{'__DIE__'} =
              sub { (my $x = $_[0]) =~ s/foo/bar/g; die $x };
       eval { die &quot;foo lives here&quot; };
       print $@ if $@;                # prints &quot;bar lives here&quot;
    }

  <dd>This function is similar to a string eval, except it always parses its
      argument (or <span class="Li">$_</span> if EXPR is omitted) as a string of
      independent bytes.
    <p class="Pp">If called when
        <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;utf8&quot;</span> is in effect, the

        <span class="Li">&quot;evalbytes&quot;</span> will make a temporary copy
        to work from, downgraded to non-UTF-8. If this is not possible (because
        one or more characters in it require UTF-8), the
        <span class="Li">&quot;evalbytes&quot;</span> will fail with the error
        stored in <span class="Li">$@</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Bytes that correspond to ASCII-range code points will have
        their normal meanings for operators in the string. The treatment of the
        other bytes depends on if the
        <span class="Li">&quot;'unicode_strings&quot;&quot;</span> feature is in
        effect.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Of course, variables that are UTF-8 and are referred to in the

        the <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::&quot;</span> if the
        <span class="Li">&quot;evalbytes&quot;</span> feature is enabled. This

  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> function executes a system
      command <i>and never</i> <i>returns</i>; use
      <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> instead of
      <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> if you want it to return. It
      fails and returns false only if the command does not exist <i>and</i> it
      is executed directly instead of via your system's command shell (see
      below).
    <p class="Pp">Since it's a common mistake to use
        <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> instead of
        <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span>, Perl warns you if
        <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> is called in void context and
        if there is a following statement that isn't
        <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;warn&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;exit&quot;</span> (if warnings are enabled--but
        you always do that, right?). If you <i>really</i> want to follow an
        <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> with some other statement, you
        can use one of these styles to avoid the warning:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    exec ('foo')   or print STDERR &quot;couldn't exec foo: $!&quot;;
    { exec ('foo') }; print STDERR &quot;couldn't exec foo: $!&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If there is more than one argument in LIST, this calls
        <b>execvp</b>(3) with the arguments in LIST. If there is only one
        element in LIST, the argument is checked for shell metacharacters, and
        if there are any, the entire argument is passed to the system's command
        shell for parsing (this is <span class="Li">&quot;/bin/sh
        -c&quot;</span> on Unix platforms, but varies on other platforms). If
        there are no shell metacharacters in the argument, it is split into
        words and passed directly to <span class="Li">&quot;execvp&quot;</span>,
        which is more efficient. Examples:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    exec '/bin/echo', 'Your arguments are: ', @ARGV;
    exec &quot;sort $outfile | uniq&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you don't really want to execute the first argument, but
        want to lie to the program you are executing about its own name, you can
        specify the program you actually want to run as an &quot;indirect
        object&quot; (without a comma) in front of the LIST, as in
        <span class="Li">&quot;exec PROGRAM LIST&quot;</span>. (This always
        forces interpretation of the LIST as a multivalued list, even if there
        is only a single scalar in the list.) Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $shell = '/bin/csh';
    exec $shell '-sh';    # pretend it's a login shell
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or, more directly,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    exec {'/bin/csh'} '-sh';  # pretend it's a login shell
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">When the arguments get executed via the system shell, results
        are subject to its quirks and capabilities. See &quot;`STRING`&quot; in
        perlop for details.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Using an indirect object with
        <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> is also more secure. This
        usage (which also works fine with
        <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span>) forces interpretation of the
        arguments as a multivalued list, even if the list had just one argument.
        That way you're safe from the shell expanding wildcards or splitting up
        words with whitespace in them.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @args = ( &quot;echo surprise&quot; );
    exec @args;               # subject to shell escapes
                                # if @args == 1
    exec { $args[0] } @args;  # safe even with one-arg list
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The first version, the one without the indirect object, ran
        the <i>echo</i> program, passing it
        <span class="Li">&quot;surprise&quot;</span> an argument. The second
        version didn't; it tried to run a program named <i>&quot;echo
        surprise&quot;</i>, didn't find it, and set <span class="Li">$?</span>
        to a non-zero value indicating failure.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On Windows, only the <span class="Li">&quot;exec PROGRAM
        LIST&quot;</span> indirect object syntax will reliably avoid using the
        shell; <span class="Li">&quot;exec LIST&quot;</span>, even with more
        than one element, will fall back to the shell if the first spawn
      fails.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl attempts to flush all files opened for output before the
        exec, but this may not be supported on some platforms (see perlport). To
        be safe, you may need to set <span class="Li">$|</span>
        (<span class="Li">$AUTOFLUSH</span> in English) or call the
        <span class="Li">&quot;autoflush&quot;</span> method of
        <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Handle&quot;</span> on any open handles to
        avoid lost output.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span> will not
        call your <span class="Li">&quot;END&quot;</span> blocks, nor will it
        invoke <span class="Li">&quot;DESTROY&quot;</span> methods on your
        objects.</p>

        case changes that cross the 255/256 boundary are problematic under
        locales, and are hence prohibited. Therefore, this function under locale
        returns instead the string
        <span class="Li">&quot;\x{17F}\x{17F}&quot;</span>, which is the
        <i>LATIN SMALL LETTER</i> <i>LONG S</i>. Since that character itself
        folds to <span class="Li">&quot;s&quot;</span>, the string of two of
        them together should be equivalent to a single U+1E9E when
      foldcased.</p>
    <p class="Pp">While the Unicode Standard defines two additional forms of
        casefolding, one for Turkic languages and one that never maps one
        character into multiple characters, these are not provided by the Perl
        core. However, the CPAN module
        <span class="Li">&quot;Unicode::Casing&quot;</span> may be used to
        provide an implementation.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;fc&quot;</span> is available only if
        the <span class="Li">&quot;fc&quot;</span> feature is enabled or if it
        is prefixed with <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::&quot;</span>. The

    DIRHANDLE</a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the file descriptor for a filehandle or directory handle, or
      undefined if the filehandle is not open. If there is no real file
      descriptor at the OS level, as can happen with filehandles connected to
      memory objects via <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> with a
      reference for the third argument, -1 is returned.
    <p class="Pp">This is mainly useful for constructing bitmaps for
        <span class="Li">&quot;select&quot;</span> and low-level POSIX
        tty-handling operations. If FILEHANDLE is an expression, the value is
        taken as an indirect filehandle, generally its name.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can use this to find out whether two handles refer to the
        same underlying descriptor:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    if (fileno($this) != -1 &amp;&amp; fileno($this) == fileno($that)) {
        print &quot;\$this and \$that are dups\n&quot;;
    } elsif (fileno($this) != -1 &amp;&amp; fileno($that) != -1) {

    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The behavior of <span class="Li">&quot;fileno&quot;</span> on
        a directory handle depends on the operating system. On a system with
        <b>dirfd</b>(3) or similar, <span class="Li">&quot;fileno&quot;</span>
        on a directory handle returns the underlying file descriptor associated
        with the handle; on systems with no such support, it returns the
        undefined value, and sets <span class="Li">$!</span> (errno).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="flock"><a class="permalink" href="#flock">flock
    FILEHANDLE,OPERATION</a></dt>
  <dd>Calls <b>flock</b>(2), or an emulation of it, on FILEHANDLE. Returns true
      for success, false on failure. Produces a fatal error if used on a machine
      that doesn't implement <b>flock</b>(2), <b>fcntl</b>(2) locking, or
      <b>lockf</b>(3). <span class="Li">&quot;flock&quot;</span> is Perl's
      portable file-locking interface, although it locks entire files only, not
      records.
    <p class="Pp">Two potentially non-obvious but traditional
        <span class="Li">&quot;flock&quot;</span> semantics are that it waits
        indefinitely until the lock is granted, and that its locks are <b>merely
        advisory</b>. Such discretionary locks are more flexible, but offer
        fewer guarantees. This means that programs that do not also use
        <span class="Li">&quot;flock&quot;</span> may modify files locked with
        <span class="Li">&quot;flock&quot;</span>. See perlport, your port's
        specific documentation, and your system-specific local manpages for
        details. It's best to assume traditional behavior if you're writing
        portable programs. (But if you're not, you should as always feel
        perfectly free to write for your own system's idiosyncrasies (sometimes
        called &quot;features&quot;). Slavish adherence to portability concerns
        shouldn't get in the way of your getting your job done.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">OPERATION is one of LOCK_SH, LOCK_EX, or LOCK_UN, possibly
        combined with LOCK_NB. These constants are traditionally valued 1, 2, 8
        and 4, but you can use the symbolic names if you import them from the
        Fcntl module, either individually, or as a group using the
        <span class="Li">&quot;:flock&quot;</span> tag. LOCK_SH requests a
        shared lock, LOCK_EX requests an exclusive lock, and LOCK_UN releases a
        previously requested lock. If LOCK_NB is bitwise-or'ed with LOCK_SH or
        LOCK_EX, then <span class="Li">&quot;flock&quot;</span> returns
        immediately rather than blocking waiting for the lock; check the return
        status to see if you got it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To avoid the possibility of miscoordination, Perl now flushes
        FILEHANDLE before locking or unlocking it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the emulation built with <b>lockf</b>(3) doesn't
        provide shared locks, and it requires that FILEHANDLE be open with write
        intent. These are the semantics that <b>lockf</b>(3) implements. Most if
        not all systems implement <b>lockf</b>(3) in terms of <b>fcntl</b>(2)
        locking, though, so the differing semantics shouldn't bite too many
        people.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the <b>fcntl</b>(2) emulation of <b>flock</b>(3)
        requires that FILEHANDLE be open with read intent to use LOCK_SH and
        requires that it be open with write intent to use LOCK_EX.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note also that some versions of
        <span class="Li">&quot;flock&quot;</span> cannot lock things over the
        network; you would need to use the more system-specific
        <span class="Li">&quot;fcntl&quot;</span> for that. If you like you can
        force Perl to ignore your system's <b>flock</b>(2) function, and so
        provide its own <b>fcntl</b>(2)-based emulation, by passing the switch
        <span class="Li">&quot;-Ud_flock&quot;</span> to the <i>Configure</i>
        program when you configure and build a new Perl.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here's a mailbox appender for BSD systems.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # import LOCK_* and SEEK_END constants
    use Fcntl qw(:flock SEEK_END);
    sub lock {
        my ($fh) = @_;
        flock($fh, LOCK_EX) or die &quot;Cannot lock mailbox - $!\n&quot;;
        # and, in case we're running on a very old UNIX
        # variant without the modern O_APPEND semantics...
        seek($fh, 0, SEEK_END) or die &quot;Cannot seek - $!\n&quot;;
    }
    sub unlock {
        my ($fh) = @_;
        flock($fh, LOCK_UN) or die &quot;Cannot unlock mailbox - $!\n&quot;;
    }
    open(my $mbox, &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;, &quot;/usr/spool/mail/$ENV{'USER'}&quot;)
        or die &quot;Can't open mailbox: $!&quot;;
    lock($mbox);
    print $mbox $msg,&quot;\n\n&quot;;
    unlock($mbox);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">On systems that support a real <b>flock</b>(2), locks are
        inherited across <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span> calls, whereas
        those that must resort to the more capricious <b>fcntl</b>(2) function
        lose their locks, making it seriously harder to write servers.</p>

  <dt id="fork"><a class="permalink" href="#fork">fork</a></dt>
  <dd>Does a <b>fork</b>(2) system call to create a new process running the same
      program at the same point. It returns the child pid to the parent process,
      <span class="Li">0</span> to the child process, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> if the fork is unsuccessful.
      File descriptors (and sometimes locks on those descriptors) are shared,
      while everything else is copied. On most systems supporting
      <b>fork</b>(2), great care has gone into making it extremely efficient
      (for example, using copy-on-write technology on data pages), making it the
      dominant paradigm for multitasking over the last few decades.
    <p class="Pp">Perl attempts to flush all files opened for output before
        forking the child process, but this may not be supported on some
        platforms (see perlport). To be safe, you may need to set
        <span class="Li">$|</span> (<span class="Li">$AUTOFLUSH</span> in
        English) or call the <span class="Li">&quot;autoflush&quot;</span>
        method of <span class="Li">&quot;IO::Handle&quot;</span> on any open
        handles to avoid duplicate output.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span> without ever
        waiting on your children, you will accumulate zombies. On some systems,
        you can avoid this by setting <span class="Li">$SIG{CHLD}</span> to
        <span class="Li">&quot;IGNORE&quot;</span>. See also perlipc for more
        examples of forking and reaping moribund children.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that if your forked child inherits system file
        descriptors like STDIN and STDOUT that are actually connected by a pipe
        or socket, even if you exit, then the remote server (such as, say, a CGI
        script or a backgrounded job launched from a remote shell) won't think
        you're done. You should reopen those to <i>/dev/null</i> if it's any
        issue.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On some platforms such as Windows, where the <b>fork</b>(2)
        system call is not available, Perl can be built to emulate
        <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span> in the Perl interpreter. The
        emulation is designed, at the level of the Perl program, to be as
        compatible as possible with the &quot;Unix&quot; <b>fork</b>(2). However
        it has limitations that have to be considered in code intended to be
        portable. See perlfork for more details.</p>

    $num = $cost/$quantity;
    $~ = 'Something';

    <p class="Pp">See perlform for many details and examples.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="formline"><a class="permalink" href="#formline">formline
    PICTURE,LIST</a></dt>
  <dd>This is an internal function used by
      <span class="Li">&quot;format&quot;</span>s, though you may call it, too.
      It formats (see perlform) a list of values according to the contents of
      PICTURE, placing the output into the format output accumulator,
      <span class="Li">$^A</span> (or <span class="Li">$ACCUMULATOR</span> in
      English). Eventually, when a <span class="Li">&quot;write&quot;</span> is
      done, the contents of <span class="Li">$^A</span> are written to some
      filehandle. You could also read <span class="Li">$^A</span> and then set
      <span class="Li">$^A</span> back to <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span>.
      Note that a format typically does one
      <span class="Li">&quot;formline&quot;</span> per line of form, but the
      <span class="Li">&quot;formline&quot;</span> function itself doesn't care
      how many newlines are embedded in the PICTURE. This means that the
      <span class="Li">&quot;~&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;~~&quot;</span> tokens treat the entire PICTURE as
      a single line. You may therefore need to use multiple formlines to
      implement a single record format, just like the
      <span class="Li">&quot;format&quot;</span> compiler.
    <p class="Pp">Be careful if you put double quotes around the picture,
        because an <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> character may be taken
        to mean the beginning of an array name.
        <span class="Li">&quot;formline&quot;</span> always returns true. See
        perlform for other examples.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you are trying to use this instead of
        <span class="Li">&quot;write&quot;</span> to capture the output, you may
        find it easier to open a filehandle to a scalar
        (<span class="Li">&quot;open my $fh, &quot;&gt;&quot;,
        \$output&quot;</span>) and write to that instead.</p>

  <dd>Returns the next character from the input file attached to FILEHANDLE, or

      from STDIN. This is not particularly efficient. However, it cannot be used
      by itself to fetch single characters without waiting for the user to hit
      enter. For that, try something more like:

  <dd>These routines are the same as their counterparts in the system C library.
      In list context, the return values from the various get routines are as
      follows:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> #    0        1          2           3         4
 my ( $name,   $passwd,   $gid,       $members  ) = getgr*
 my ( $name,   $aliases,  $addrtype,  $net      ) = getnet*
 my ( $name,   $aliases,  $port,      $proto    ) = getserv*
 my ( $name,   $aliases,  $proto                ) = getproto*
 my ( $name,   $aliases,  $addrtype,  $length,  @addrs ) = gethost*
 my ( $name,   $passwd,   $uid,       $gid,     $quota,
    $comment,  $gcos,     $dir,       $shell,   $expire ) = getpw*
 #    5        6          7           8         9
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(If the entry doesn't exist, the return value is a single
        meaningless true value.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">The exact meaning of the <span class="Li">$gcos</span> field
        varies but it usually contains the real name of the user (as opposed to
        the login name) and other information pertaining to the user. Beware,
        however, that in many system users are able to change this information
        and therefore it cannot be trusted and therefore the
        <span class="Li">$gcos</span> is tainted (see perlsec). The
        <span class="Li">$passwd</span> and <span class="Li">$shell</span>,
        user's encrypted password and login shell, are also tainted, for the
        same reason.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In scalar context, you get the name, unless the function was a
        lookup by name, in which case you get the other thing, whatever it is.
        (If the entry doesn't exist you get the undefined value.) For
      example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $uid   = getpwnam($name);
    my $name  = getpwuid($num);
    my $name  = getpwent();
    my $gid   = getgrnam($name);
    my $name  = getgrgid($num);
    my $name  = getgrent();
    # etc.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In <i>getpw*()</i> the fields <span class="Li">$quota</span>,
        <span class="Li">$comment</span>, and <span class="Li">$expire</span>
        are special in that they are unsupported on many systems. If the
        <span class="Li">$quota</span> is unsupported, it is an empty scalar. If
        it is supported, it usually encodes the disk quota. If the
        <span class="Li">$comment</span> field is unsupported, it is an empty
        scalar. If it is supported it usually encodes some administrative
        comment about the user. In some systems the
        <span class="Li">$quota</span> field may be
        <span class="Li">$change</span> or <span class="Li">$age</span>, fields
        that have to do with password aging. In some systems the
        <span class="Li">$comment</span> field may be
        <span class="Li">$class</span>. The <span class="Li">$expire</span>
        field, if present, encodes the expiration period of the account or the
        password. For the availability and the exact meaning of these fields in
        your system, please consult <b>getpwnam</b>(3) and your system's
        <i>pwd.h</i> file. You can also find out from within Perl what your
        <span class="Li">$quota</span> and <span class="Li">$comment</span>
        fields mean and whether you have the <span class="Li">$expire</span>
        field by using the <span class="Li">&quot;Config&quot;</span> module and
        the values <span class="Li">&quot;d_pwquota&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;d_pwage&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;d_pwchange&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;d_pwcomment&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;d_pwexpire&quot;</span>. Shadow password files
        are supported only if your vendor has implemented them in the intuitive
        fashion that calling the regular C library routines gets the shadow
        versions if you're running under privilege or if there exists the
        <b>shadow</b>(3) functions as found in System V (this includes Solaris
        and Linux). Those systems that implement a proprietary shadow password
        facility are unlikely to be supported.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$members</span> value returned by
        <i>getgr*()</i> is a space-separated list of the login names of the
        members of the group.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For the <i>gethost*()</i> functions, if the
        <span class="Li">&quot;h_errno&quot;</span> variable is supported in C,
        it will be returned to you via <span class="Li">$?</span> if the
        function call fails. The <span class="Li">@addrs</span> value returned
        by a successful call is a list of raw addresses returned by the
        corresponding library call. In the Internet domain, each address is four
        bytes long; you can unpack it by saying something like:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my ($w,$x,$y,$z) = unpack('W4',$addr[0]);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The Socket library makes this slightly easier:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Socket;
    my $iaddr = inet_aton(&quot;127.1&quot;); # or whatever address
    my $name  = gethostbyaddr($iaddr, AF_INET);
    # or going the other way
    my $straddr = inet_ntoa($iaddr);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In the opposite way, to resolve a hostname to the IP address
        you can write this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Socket;
    my $packed_ip = gethostbyname(&quot;www.perl.org&quot;);
    my $ip_address;
    if (defined $packed_ip) {
        $ip_address = inet_ntoa($packed_ip);
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Make sure <span class="Li">&quot;gethostbyname&quot;</span> is
        called in SCALAR context and that its return value is checked for
        definedness.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;getprotobynumber&quot;</span>
        function, even though it only takes one argument, has the precedence of
        a list operator, so beware:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    getprotobynumber $number eq 'icmp'   # WRONG
    getprotobynumber($number eq 'icmp')  # actually means this
    getprotobynumber($number) eq 'icmp'  # better this way
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you get tired of remembering which element of the return
        list contains which return value, by-name interfaces are provided in
        standard modules: <span class="Li">&quot;File::stat&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;Net::hostent&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;Net::netent&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;Net::protoent&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;Net::servent&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;Time::gmtime&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;Time::localtime&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;User::grent&quot;</span>. These override the
        normal built-ins, supplying versions that return objects with the
        appropriate names for each field. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   use File::stat;
   use User::pwent;
   my $is_his = (stat($filename)-&gt;uid == pwent($whoever)-&gt;uid);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Even though it looks as though they're the same method calls
        (uid), they aren't, because a
        <span class="Li">&quot;File::stat&quot;</span> object is different from
        a <span class="Li">&quot;User::pwent&quot;</span> object.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Many of these functions are not safe in a multi-threaded
        environment where more than one thread can be using them. In particular,
        functions like <span class="Li">&quot;getpwent()&quot;</span> iterate
        per-process and not per-thread, so if two threads are simultaneously
        iterating, neither will get all the records.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Some systems have thread-safe versions of some of the
        functions, such as <span class="Li">&quot;getpwnam_r()&quot;</span>
        instead of <span class="Li">&quot;getpwnam()&quot;</span>. There, Perl
        automatically and invisibly substitutes the thread-safe version, without
        notice. This means that code that safely runs on some systems can fail
        on others that lack the thread-safe versions.</p>

  <dd>Queries the option named OPTNAME associated with SOCKET at a given LEVEL.
      Options may exist at multiple protocol levels depending on the socket
      type, but at least the uppermost socket level SOL_SOCKET (defined in the
      <span class="Li">&quot;Socket&quot;</span> module) will exist. To query
      options at another level the protocol number of the appropriate protocol
      controlling the option should be supplied. For example, to indicate that
      an option is to be interpreted by the TCP protocol, LEVEL should be set to
      the protocol number of TCP, which you can get using
      <span class="Li">&quot;getprotobyname&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">The function returns a packed string representing the
        requested socket option, or <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> on
        error, with the reason for the error placed in
        <span class="Li">$!</span>. Just what is in the packed string depends on
        LEVEL and OPTNAME; consult <b>getsockopt</b>(2) for details. A common
        case is that the option is an integer, in which case the result is a
        packed integer, which you can decode using

  <dt>glob EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="glob"><a class="permalink" href="#glob">glob</a></dt>
  <dd>In list context, returns a (possibly empty) list of filename expansions on
      the value of EXPR such as the standard Unix shell <i>/bin/csh</i> would
      do. In scalar context, glob iterates through such filename expansions,
      returning undef when the list is exhausted. This is the internal function
      implementing the <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;*.c&gt;&quot;</span> operator,
      but you can use it directly. If EXPR is omitted,
      <span class="Li">$_</span> is used. The
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;*.c&gt;&quot;</span> operator is discussed in
      more detail in &quot;I/O Operators&quot; in perlop.
    <p class="Pp">Note that <span class="Li">&quot;glob&quot;</span> splits its
        arguments on whitespace and treats each segment as separate pattern. As
        such, <span class="Li">&quot;glob(&quot;*.c *.h&quot;)&quot;</span>
        matches all files with a <i>.c</i> or <i>.h</i> extension. The
        expression <span class="Li">&quot;glob(&quot;.* *&quot;)&quot;</span>
        matches all files in the current working directory. If you want to glob
        filenames that might contain whitespace, you'll have to use extra quotes
        around the spacey filename to protect it. For example, to glob filenames
        that have an <span class="Li">&quot;e&quot;</span> followed by a space
        followed by an <span class="Li">&quot;f&quot;</span>, use one of:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @spacies = &lt;&quot;*e f*&quot;&gt;;
    my @spacies = glob '&quot;*e f*&quot;';
    my @spacies = glob q(&quot;*e f*&quot;);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you had to get a variable through, you could do this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @spacies = glob &quot;'*${var}e f*'&quot;;
    my @spacies = glob qq(&quot;*${var}e f*&quot;);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If non-empty braces are the only wildcard characters used in
        the <span class="Li">&quot;glob&quot;</span>, no filenames are matched,
        but potentially many strings are returned. For example, this produces
        nine strings, one for each pairing of fruits and colors:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @many = glob &quot;{apple,tomato,cherry}={green,yellow,red}&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This operator is implemented using the standard
        <span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob&quot;</span> extension. See File::Glob
        for details, including <span class="Li">&quot;bsd_glob&quot;</span>,
        which does not treat whitespace as a pattern separator.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If a <span class="Li">&quot;glob&quot;</span> expression is
        used as the condition of a <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;for&quot;</span> loop, then it will be implicitly
        assigned to <span class="Li">$_</span>. If either a
        <span class="Li">&quot;glob&quot;</span> expression or an explicit
        assignment of a <span class="Li">&quot;glob&quot;</span> expression to a
        scalar is used as a
        <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;for&quot;</span>
        condition, then the condition actually tests for definedness of the
        expression's value, not for its regular truth value.</p>

  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;goto LABEL&quot;</span> form finds the
      statement labeled with LABEL and resumes execution there. It can't be used
      to get out of a block or subroutine given to
      <span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span>. It can be used to go almost
      anywhere else within the dynamic scope, including out of subroutines, but
      it's usually better to use some other construct such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;last&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>. The author of Perl has never felt
      the need to use this form of <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span> (in
      Perl, that is; C is another matter). (The difference is that C does not
      offer named loops combined with loop control. Perl does, and this replaces
      most structured uses of <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span> in other
      languages.)
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;goto EXPR&quot;</span> form expects
        to evaluate <span class="Li">&quot;EXPR&quot;</span> to a code reference
        or a label name. If it evaluates to a code reference, it will be handled
        like <span class="Li">&quot;goto &amp;NAME&quot;</span>, below. This is
        especially useful for implementing tail recursion via
        <span class="Li">&quot;goto __SUB__&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the expression evaluates to a label name, its scope will be
        resolved dynamically. This allows for computed
        <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>s per FORTRAN, but isn't
        necessarily recommended if you're optimizing for maintainability:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    goto (&quot;FOO&quot;, &quot;BAR&quot;, &quot;GLARCH&quot;)[$i];
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">As shown in this example, <span class="Li">&quot;goto
        EXPR&quot;</span> is exempt from the &quot;looks like a function&quot;
        rule. A pair of parentheses following it does not (necessarily) delimit
        its argument.
        <span class="Li">&quot;goto(&quot;NE&quot;).&quot;XT&quot;&quot;</span>
        is equivalent to <span class="Li">&quot;goto NEXT&quot;</span>. Also,
        unlike most named operators, this has the same precedence as
      assignment.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Use of <span class="Li">&quot;goto LABEL&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;goto EXPR&quot;</span> to jump into a construct
        is deprecated and will issue a warning. Even then, it may not be used to
        go into any construct that requires initialization, such as a
        subroutine, a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loop, or a
        <span class="Li">&quot;given&quot;</span> block. In general, it may not
        be used to jump into the parameter of a binary or list operator, but it
        may be used to jump into the <i>first</i> parameter of a binary
        operator. (The <span class="Li">&quot;=&quot;</span> assignment
        operator's &quot;first&quot; operand is its right-hand operand.) It also
        can't be used to go into a construct that is optimized away.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;goto &amp;NAME&quot;</span> form is
        quite different from the other forms of
        <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>. In fact, it isn't a goto in
        the normal sense at all, and doesn't have the stigma associated with
        other gotos. Instead, it exits the current subroutine (losing any
        changes set by <span class="Li">&quot;local&quot;</span>) and
        immediately calls in its place the named subroutine using the current
        value of <span class="Li">@_</span>. This is used by
        <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> subroutines that wish to
        load another subroutine and then pretend that the other subroutine had
        been called in the first place (except that any modifications to
        <span class="Li">@_</span> in the current subroutine are propagated to
        the other subroutine.) After the
        <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>, not even
        <span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span> will be able to tell that
        this routine was called first.</p>
    <p class="Pp">NAME needn't be the name of a subroutine; it can be a scalar
        variable containing a code reference or a block that evaluates to a code
        reference.</p>

  <dd>This is similar in spirit to, but not the same as, <b>grep</b>(1) and its
      relatives. In particular, it is not limited to using regular expressions.
    <p class="Pp">Evaluates the BLOCK or EXPR for each element of LIST (locally
        setting <span class="Li">$_</span> to each element) and returns the list
        value consisting of those elements for which the expression evaluated to
        true. In scalar context, returns the number of times the expression was
        true.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @foo = grep(!/^#/, @bar);    # weed out comments
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or equivalently,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @foo = grep {!/^#/} @bar;    # weed out comments
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that <span class="Li">$_</span> is an alias to the list
        value, so it can be used to modify the elements of the LIST. While this
        is useful and supported, it can cause bizarre results if the elements of
        LIST are not variables. Similarly, grep returns aliases into the
        original list, much as a for loop's index variable aliases the list
        elements. That is, modifying an element of a list returned by grep (for
        example, in a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;map&quot;</span> or another
        <span class="Li">&quot;grep&quot;</span>) actually modifies the element
        in the original list. This is usually something to be avoided when
        writing clear code.</p>

  <dt id="hex"><a class="permalink" href="#hex">hex</a></dt>
  <dd>Interprets EXPR as a hex string and returns the corresponding numeric

    <p class="Pp">A hex string consists of hex digits and an optional
        <span class="Li">&quot;0x&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span> prefix. Each hex digit may be
        preceded by a single underscore, which will be ignored. Any other
        character triggers a warning and causes the rest of the string to be
        ignored (even leading whitespace, unlike
        <span class="Li">&quot;oct&quot;</span>). Only integers can be

      It is just an ordinary method (subroutine) defined (or inherited) by
      modules that wish to export names to another module. The

  <dd>The index function searches for one string within another, but without the
      wildcard-like behavior of a full regular-expression pattern match. It
      returns the position of the first occurrence of SUBSTR in STR at or after
      POSITION. If POSITION is omitted, starts searching from the beginning of
      the string. POSITION before the beginning of the string or after its end
      is treated as if it were the beginning or the end, respectively. POSITION
      and the return value are based at zero. If the substring is not found,
      <span class="Li">&quot;index&quot;</span> returns -1.

      <span class="Li">&quot;int(-6.725/0.025)&quot;</span> produces -268 rather
      than the correct -269; that's because it's really more like

        it's nontrivial.) SCALAR will be read and/or written depending on the
        FUNCTION; a C pointer to the string value of SCALAR will be passed as
        the third argument of the actual
        <span class="Li">&quot;ioctl&quot;</span> call. (If SCALAR has no string
        value but does have a numeric value, that value will be passed rather
        than a pointer to the string value. To guarantee this to be true, add a
        <span class="Li">0</span> to the scalar before using it.) The
        <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span> and

    <p class="Pp">The return value of <span class="Li">&quot;ioctl&quot;</span>

  <dt id="keys"><a class="permalink" href="#keys">keys HASH</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="keys~2"><a class="permalink" href="#keys~2">keys ARRAY</a></dt>
  <dd>Called in list context, returns a list consisting of all the keys of the
      named hash, or in Perl 5.12 or later only, the indices of an array. Perl
      releases prior to 5.12 will produce a syntax error if you try to use an
      array argument. In scalar context, returns the number of keys or indices.
    <p class="Pp">Hash entries are returned in an apparently random order. The
        actual random order is specific to a given hash; the exact same series
        of operations on two hashes may result in a different order for each
        hash. Any insertion into the hash may change the order, as will any
        deletion, with the exception that the most recent key returned by
        <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span> may be deleted without changing
        the order. So long as a given hash is unmodified you may rely on
        <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;values&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> to repeatedly return the same
        order as each other. See &quot;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&quot; in
        perlsec for details on why hash order is randomized. Aside from the
        guarantees provided here the exact details of Perl's hash algorithm and
        the hash traversal order are subject to change in any release of Perl.
        Tied hashes may behave differently to Perl's hashes with respect to
        changes in order on insertion and deletion of items.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As a side effect, calling
        <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span> resets the internal iterator of
        the HASH or ARRAY (see <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span>) before
        yielding the keys. In particular, calling
        <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span> in void context resets the
        iterator with no other overhead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here is yet another way to print your environment:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @keys = keys %ENV;
    my @values = values %ENV;
    while (@keys) {
        print pop(@keys), '=', pop(@values), &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or how about sorted by key:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    foreach my $key (sort(keys %ENV)) {
        print $key, '=', $ENV{$key}, &quot;\n&quot;;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The returned values are copies of the original keys in the
        hash, so modifying them will not affect the original hash. Compare
        <span class="Li">&quot;values&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To sort a hash by value, you'll need to use a
        <span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span> function. Here's a descending
        numeric sort of a hash by its values:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    foreach my $key (sort { $hash{$b} &lt;=&gt; $hash{$a} } keys %hash) {
        printf &quot;%4d %s\n&quot;, $hash{$key}, $key;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Used as an lvalue, <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span>
        allows you to increase the number of hash buckets allocated for the
        given hash. This can gain you a measure of efficiency if you know the
        hash is going to get big. (This is similar to pre-extending an array by
        assigning a larger number to $#array.) If you say</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    keys %hash = 200;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">then <span class="Li">%hash</span> will have at least 200
        buckets allocated for it--256 of them, in fact, since it rounds up to
        the next power of two. These buckets will be retained even if you do
        <span class="Li">&quot;%hash = ()&quot;</span>, use
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef</span> <span class="Li">%hash&quot;</span>
        if you want to free the storage while <span class="Li">%hash</span> is
        still in scope. You can't shrink the number of buckets allocated for the
        hash using <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span> in this way (but you
        needn't worry about doing this by accident, as trying has no effect).
        <span class="Li">&quot;keys @array&quot;</span> in an lvalue context is
        a syntax error.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Starting with Perl 5.14, an experimental feature allowed
        <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span> to take a scalar expression.
        This experiment has been deemed unsuccessful, and was removed as of Perl
        5.24.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To avoid confusing would-be users of your code who are running
        earlier versions of Perl with mysterious syntax errors, put this sort of
        thing at the top of your file to signal that your code will work

  <dt id="kill"><a class="permalink" href="#kill">kill SIGNAL, LIST</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="kill~2"><a class="permalink" href="#kill~2">kill SIGNAL</a></dt>
  <dd>Sends a signal to a list of processes. Returns the number of arguments
      that were successfully used to signal (which is not necessarily the same
      as the number of processes actually killed, e.g. where a process group is
      killed).
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $cnt = kill 'HUP', $child1, $child2;
    kill 'KILL', @goners;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">SIGNAL may be either a signal name (a string) or a signal
        number. A signal name may start with a
        <span class="Li">&quot;SIG&quot;</span> prefix, thus
        <span class="Li">&quot;FOO&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;SIGFOO&quot;</span> refer to the same signal. The
        string form of SIGNAL is recommended for portability because the same
        signal may have different numbers in different operating systems.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A list of signal names supported by the current platform can
        be found in <span class="Li">$Config{sig_name}</span>, which is provided
        by the <span class="Li">&quot;Config&quot;</span> module. See Config for
        more details.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A negative signal name is the same as a negative signal
        number, killing process groups instead of processes. For example,
        <span class="Li">&quot;kill '-KILL', $pgrp&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;kill -9, $pgrp&quot;</span> will send
        <span class="Li">&quot;SIGKILL&quot;</span> to the entire process group
        specified. That means you usually want to use positive not negative
        signals.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If SIGNAL is either the number 0 or the string
        <span class="Li">&quot;ZERO&quot;</span> (or
        <span class="Li">&quot;SIGZERO&quot;</span>), no signal is sent to the
        process, but <span class="Li">&quot;kill&quot;</span> checks whether
        it's <i>possible</i> to send a signal to it (that means, to be brief,
        that the process is owned by the same user, or we are the super-user).
        This is useful to check that a child process is still alive (even if
        only as a zombie) and hasn't changed its UID. See perlport for notes on
        the portability of this construct.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The behavior of kill when a <i>PROCESS</i> number is zero or
        negative depends on the operating system. For example, on
        POSIX-conforming systems, zero will signal the current process group, -1
        will signal all processes, and any other negative PROCESS number will
        act as a negative signal number and kill the entire process group
        specified.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If both the SIGNAL and the PROCESS are negative, the results
        are undefined. A warning may be produced in a future version.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See &quot;Signals&quot; in perlipc for more details.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On some platforms such as Windows where the <b>fork</b>(2)
        system call is not available, Perl can be built to emulate
        <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span> at the interpreter level. This
        emulation has limitations related to kill that have to be considered,
        for code running on Windows and in code intended to be portable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See perlfork for more details.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If there is no <i>LIST</i> of processes, no signal is sent,
        and the return value is 0. This form is sometimes used, however, because
        it causes tainting checks to be run. But see &quot;Laundering and
        Detecting Tainted Data&quot; in perlsec.</p>

        case changes that cross the 255/256 boundary are not well-defined. For
        example, the lower case of LATIN CAPITAL LETTER SHARP S (U+1E9E) in
        Unicode rules is U+00DF (on ASCII platforms). But under
        <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> (prior to v5.20 or not a
        UTF-8 locale), the lower case of U+1E9E is itself, because 0xDF may not
        be LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S in the current locale, and Perl has no way
        of knowing if that character even exists in the locale, much less what
        code point it is. Perl returns a result that is above 255 (almost always
        the input character unchanged), for all instances (and there aren't
        many) where the 255/256 boundary would otherwise be crossed; and
        starting in v5.22, it raises a locale warning.</p>

  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span> command is like the

    <pre>    LINE: while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        next LINE if /^#/;  # discard comments
        #...

    <p class="Pp">Note that if there were a
        <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span> block on the above, it
        would get executed even on discarded lines. If LABEL is omitted, the
        command refers to the innermost enclosing loop. The
        <span class="Li">&quot;next EXPR&quot;</span> form, available as of Perl
        5.18.0, allows a label name to be computed at run time, being otherwise
        identical to <span class="Li">&quot;next LABEL&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span> cannot return a value
        from a block that typically returns a value, such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;eval {}&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;sub
        {}&quot;</span>, or <span class="Li">&quot;do {}&quot;</span>. It will
        perform its flow control behavior, which precludes any return value. It
        should not be used to exit a <span class="Li">&quot;grep&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;map&quot;</span> operation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that a block by itself is semantically identical to a

        will exit such a block early.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also <span class="Li">&quot;continue&quot;</span> for an

        <span class="Li">&quot;next&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;redo&quot;</span> work.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unlike most named operators, this has the same precedence as

  <dt id="oct"><a class="permalink" href="#oct">oct</a></dt>
  <dd>Interprets EXPR as an octal string and returns the corresponding value. An
      octal string consists of octal digits and, as of Perl 5.33.5, an optional
      <span class="Li">&quot;0o&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;o&quot;</span> prefix. Each octal digit may be
      preceded by a single underscore, which will be ignored. (If EXPR happens
      to start off with <span class="Li">&quot;0x&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span>, interprets it as a hex string. If
      EXPR starts off with <span class="Li">&quot;0b&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;b&quot;</span>, it is interpreted as a binary
      string. Leading whitespace is ignored in all three cases.) The following
      will handle decimal, binary, octal, and hex in standard Perl notation:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $val = oct($val) if $val =~ /^0/;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If EXPR is omitted, uses <span class="Li">$_</span>. To go the

        <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span>:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $dec_perms = (stat(&quot;filename&quot;))[2] &amp; 07777;
    my $oct_perm_str = sprintf &quot;%o&quot;, $perms;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;oct&quot;</span> function is
        commonly used when a string such as <span class="Li">644</span> needs to
        be converted into a file mode, for example. Although Perl automatically
        converts strings into numbers as needed, this automatic conversion
        assumes base 10.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Leading white space is ignored without warning, as too are any
        trailing non-digits, such as a decimal point
        (<span class="Li">&quot;oct&quot;</span> only handles non-negative
        integers, not negative integers or floating point).</p>

  <dd>The first argument to <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>, labeled
      FILEHANDLE in this reference, is usually a scalar variable. (Exceptions
      exist, described in &quot;Other considerations&quot;, below.) If the call
      to <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> succeeds, then the expression
      provided as FILEHANDLE will get assigned an open <i>filehandle</i>. That
      filehandle provides an internal reference to the specified external file,
      conveniently stored in a Perl variable, and ready for I/O operations such
      as reading and writing.</dd>
  <dt id="About~2"><a class="permalink" href="#About~2">About modes</a></dt>
  <dd>When calling <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> with three or more
      arguments, the second argument -- labeled MODE here -- defines the <i>open
      mode</i>. MODE is usually a literal string comprising special characters
      that define the intended I/O role of the filehandle being created: whether
      it's read-only, or read-and-write, and so on.
    <p class="Pp">If MODE is <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span>, the file
        is opened for input (read-only). If MODE is
        <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span>, the file is opened for output,
        with existing files first being truncated (&quot;clobbered&quot;) and
        nonexisting files newly created. If MODE is
        <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;</span>, the file is opened for
        appending, again being created if necessary.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can put a <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span> in front
        of the <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span> to indicate that you want both
        read and write access to the file; thus
        <span class="Li">&quot;+&lt;&quot;</span> is almost always preferred for
        read/write updates--the <span class="Li">&quot;+&gt;&quot;</span> mode
        would clobber the file first. You can't usually use either read-write
        mode for updating textfiles, since they have variable-length records.
        See the <b>-i</b> switch in perlrun for a better approach. The file is
        created with permissions of <span class="Li">0666</span> modified by the
        process's <span class="Li">&quot;umask&quot;</span> value.</p>
    <p class="Pp">These various prefixes correspond to the <b>fopen</b>(3) modes
        of <span class="Li">&quot;r&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;r+&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;w&quot;</span>,

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> # Open a file for concatenation
 open(my $log, &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;, &quot;/usr/spool/news/twitlog&quot;)

  <dd>You can use the three-argument form of open to specify I/O layers
      (sometimes referred to as &quot;disciplines&quot;) to apply to the new
      filehandle. These affect how the input and output are processed (see open
      and PerlIO for more details). For example:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    open(my $fh, &quot;&lt;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;, $filename)
        || die &quot;Can't open UTF-8 encoded $filename: $!&quot;;

    <p class="Pp">This opens the UTF8-encoded file containing Unicode
        characters; see perluniintro. Note that if layers are specified in the
        three-argument form, then default layers stored in
        <span class="Li">&quot;${^OPEN}&quot;</span> (usually set by the open
        pragma or the switch <span class="Li">&quot;-CioD&quot;</span>) are
        ignored. Those layers will also be ignored if you specify a colon with
        no name following it. In that case the default layer for the operating
        system (:raw on Unix, :crlf on Windows) is used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On some systems (in general, DOS- and Windows-based systems)
        <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> is necessary when you're not
        working with a text file. For the sake of portability it is a good idea
        always to use it when appropriate, and never to use it when it isn't

        the shell interpreting any shell metacharacters in them. However, this

  <dd>You may also, in the Bourne shell tradition, specify an EXPR beginning
      with <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&amp;&quot;</span>, in which case the rest
      of the string is interpreted as the name of a filehandle (or file
      descriptor, if numeric) to be duped (as in <b>dup</b>(2)) and opened. You
      may use <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span> after
      <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span>,

      <span class="Li">&quot;+&gt;&gt;&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;+&lt;&quot;</span>. The mode you specify should
      match the mode of the original filehandle. (Duping a filehandle does not
      take into account any existing contents of IO buffers.) If you use the
      three-argument form, then you can pass either a number, the name of a
      filehandle, or the normal &quot;reference to a glob&quot;.

    <p class="Pp">If you specify <span class="Li">'&lt;&amp;=X'</span>, where
        <span class="Li">&quot;X&quot;</span> is a file descriptor number or a
        filehandle, then Perl will do an equivalent of C's <b>fdopen</b>(3) of
        that file descriptor (and not call <b>dup</b>(2)); this is more
        parsimonious of file descriptors. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # open for input, reusing the fileno of $fd
    open(my $fh, &quot;&lt;&amp;=&quot;, $fd)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    open(my $fh, &quot;&lt;&amp;=$fd&quot;)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # open for append, using the fileno of $oldfh
    open(my $fh, &quot;&gt;&gt;&amp;=&quot;, $oldfh)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Being parsimonious on filehandles is also useful (besides
        being parsimonious) for example when something is dependent on file
        descriptors, like for example locking using
        <span class="Li">&quot;flock&quot;</span>. If you do just
        <span class="Li">&quot;open(my $A, &quot;&gt;&gt;&amp;&quot;,
        $B)&quot;</span>, the filehandle <span class="Li">$A</span> will not
        have the same file descriptor as <span class="Li">$B</span>, and
        therefore <span class="Li">&quot;flock($A)&quot;</span> will not
        <span class="Li">&quot;flock($B)&quot;</span> nor vice versa. But with
        <span class="Li">&quot;open(my $A, &quot;&gt;&gt;&amp;=&quot;,
        $B)&quot;</span>, the filehandles will share the same underlying system
        file descriptor.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that under Perls older than 5.8.0, Perl uses the standard
        C library's' <b>fdopen</b>(3) to implement the
        <span class="Li">&quot;=&quot;</span> functionality. On many Unix
        systems, <b>fdopen</b>(3) fails when file descriptors exceed a certain
        value, typically 255. For Perls 5.8.0 and later, PerlIO is (most often)
        the default.</p>

  <dd>In the one- and two-argument forms of the call, the mode and filename
      should be concatenated (in that order), preferably separated by white
      space. You can--but shouldn't--omit the mode in these forms when that mode
      is <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span>. It is safe to use the
      two-argument form of <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> if the
      filename argument is a known literal.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> open(my $dbase, &quot;+&lt;dbase.mine&quot;)          # ditto

  <dt id="pack"><a class="permalink" href="#pack">pack TEMPLATE,LIST</a></dt>
  <dd>Takes a LIST of values and converts it into a string using the rules given
      by the TEMPLATE. The resulting string is the concatenation of the
      converted values. Typically, each converted value looks like its
      machine-level representation. For example, on 32-bit machines an integer
      may be represented by a sequence of 4 bytes, which will in Perl be
      presented as a string that's 4 characters long.
    <p class="Pp">See perlpacktut for an introduction to this function.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The TEMPLATE is a sequence of characters that give the order
        and type of values, as follows:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    a  A string with arbitrary binary data, will be null padded.
    A  A text (ASCII) string, will be space padded.
    Z  A null-terminated (ASCIZ) string, will be null padded.
    b  A bit string (ascending bit order inside each byte,
       like vec()).
    B  A bit string (descending bit order inside each byte).
    h  A hex string (low nybble first).
    H  A hex string (high nybble first).
    c  A signed char (8-bit) value.
    C  An unsigned char (octet) value.
    W  An unsigned char value (can be greater than 255).
    s  A signed short (16-bit) value.
    S  An unsigned short value.
    l  A signed long (32-bit) value.
    L  An unsigned long value.
    q  A signed quad (64-bit) value.
    Q  An unsigned quad value.
         (Quads are available only if your system supports 64-bit
          integer values _and_ if Perl has been compiled to support
          those.  Raises an exception otherwise.)
    i  A signed integer value.
    I  An unsigned integer value.
         (This 'integer' is _at_least_ 32 bits wide.  Its exact
          size depends on what a local C compiler calls 'int'.)
    n  An unsigned short (16-bit) in &quot;network&quot; (big-endian) order.
    N  An unsigned long (32-bit) in &quot;network&quot; (big-endian) order.
    v  An unsigned short (16-bit) in &quot;VAX&quot; (little-endian) order.
    V  An unsigned long (32-bit) in &quot;VAX&quot; (little-endian) order.
    j  A Perl internal signed integer value (IV).
    J  A Perl internal unsigned integer value (UV).
    f  A single-precision float in native format.
    d  A double-precision float in native format.
    F  A Perl internal floating-point value (NV) in native format
    D  A float of long-double precision in native format.
         (Long doubles are available only if your system supports
          long double values. Raises an exception otherwise.
          Note that there are different long double formats.)
    p  A pointer to a null-terminated string.
    P  A pointer to a structure (fixed-length string).
    u  A uuencoded string.
    U  A Unicode character number.  Encodes to a character in char-
       acter mode and UTF-8 (or UTF-EBCDIC in EBCDIC platforms) in
       byte mode.
    w  A BER compressed integer (not an ASN.1 BER, see perlpacktut
       for details).  Its bytes represent an unsigned integer in
       base 128, most significant digit first, with as few digits
       as possible.  Bit eight (the high bit) is set on each byte
       except the last.
    x  A null byte (a.k.a ASCII NUL, &quot;\000&quot;, chr(0))
    X  Back up a byte.
    @  Null-fill or truncate to absolute position, counted from the
       start of the innermost ()-group.
    .  Null-fill or truncate to absolute position specified by
       the value.
    (  Start of a ()-group.

  <dd>Each letter may optionally be followed by a number indicating the repeat

      in <span class="Li">&quot;pack(&quot;C[80]&quot;, @arr)&quot;</span>. The
      repeat count gobbles that many values from the LIST when used with all

      <span class="Li">&quot;P&quot;</span>, where it means something else,
      described below. Supplying a <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> for the
      repeat count instead of a number means to use however many items are left,
      except for:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span>, and

      <span class="Li">0</span>.</li>
  <li>&lt;.&gt;, where it means relative to the start of the string.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;u&quot;</span>, where it is equivalent to 1 (or 45,
      which here is equivalent).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">One can replace a numeric repeat count with a template letter
    enclosed in brackets to use the packed byte length of the bracketed template
    for the repeat count.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the template <span class="Li">&quot;x[L]&quot;</span>
    skips as many bytes as in a packed long, and the template
    <span class="Li">&quot;$t X[$t] $t&quot;</span> unpacks twice whatever
    <span class="Li">$t</span> (when variable-expanded) unpacks. If the template
    in brackets contains alignment commands (such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;x![d]&quot;</span>), its packed length is calculated
    as if the start of the template had the maximal possible alignment.</p>
<p class="Pp">When used with <span class="Li">&quot;Z&quot;</span>, a
    <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> as the repeat count is guaranteed to
    add a trailing null byte, so the resulting string is always one byte longer
    than the byte length of the item itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">When used with <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span>, the repeat
    count represents an offset from the start of the innermost
    <span class="Li">&quot;()&quot;</span> group.</p>
<p class="Pp">When used with <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span>, the repeat
    count determines the starting position to calculate the value offset as
    follows:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>If the repeat count is <span class="Li">0</span>, it's relative to the
      current position.</li>
  <li>If the repeat count is <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>, the offset
      is relative to the start of the packed string.</li>
  <li>And if it's an integer <i>n</i>, the offset is relative to the start of
      the <i>n</i>th innermost <span class="Li">&quot;( )&quot;</span> group, or
      to the start of the string if <i>n</i> is bigger then the group
    level.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The repeat count for <span class="Li">&quot;u&quot;</span> is
    interpreted as the maximal number of bytes to encode per line of output,
    with 0, 1 and 2 replaced by 45. The repeat count should not be more than
  65.</p>
</div>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;A&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;Z&quot;</span> types gobble just one value, but
      pack it as a string of length count, padding with nulls or spaces as
      needed. When unpacking, <span class="Li">&quot;A&quot;</span> strips
      trailing whitespace and nulls, <span class="Li">&quot;Z&quot;</span>
      strips everything after the first null, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> returns data with no stripping at
      all.
    <p class="Pp">If the value to pack is too long, the result is truncated. If
        it's too long and an explicit count is provided,
        <span class="Li">&quot;Z&quot;</span> packs only
        <span class="Li">&quot;$count-1&quot;</span> bytes, followed by a null
        byte. Thus <span class="Li">&quot;Z&quot;</span> always packs a trailing
        null, except when the count is 0.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Likewise, the <span class="Li">&quot;b&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;B&quot;</span> formats pack a string that's that
      many bits long. Each such format generates 1 bit of the result. These are
      typically followed by a repeat count like
      <span class="Li">&quot;B8&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;B64&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Each result bit is based on the least-significant bit of the
        corresponding input character, i.e., on
        <span class="Li">&quot;ord($char)%2&quot;</span>. In particular,
        characters <span class="Li">&quot;0&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;1&quot;</span> generate bits 0 and 1, as do
        characters <span class="Li">&quot;\000&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;\001&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Starting from the beginning of the input string, each 8-tuple
        of characters is converted to 1 character of output. With format
        <span class="Li">&quot;b&quot;</span>, the first character of the
        8-tuple determines the least-significant bit of a character; with format
        <span class="Li">&quot;B&quot;</span>, it determines the
        most-significant bit of a character.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the length of the input string is not evenly divisible by
        8, the remainder is packed as if the input string were padded by null
        characters at the end. Similarly during unpacking, &quot;extra&quot;
        bits are ignored.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the input string is longer than needed, remaining
        characters are ignored.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> for the repeat count
        uses all characters of the input field. On unpacking, bits are converted
        to a string of <span class="Li">0</span>s and
        <span class="Li">1</span>s.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;h&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;H&quot;</span> formats pack a string that many
      nybbles (4-bit groups, representable as hexadecimal digits,
      <span class="Li">&quot;0&quot;..&quot;9&quot;</span>
      <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;..&quot;f&quot;</span>) long.
    <p class="Pp">For each such format, <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span>
        generates 4 bits of result. With non-alphabetical characters, the result
        is based on the 4 least-significant bits of the input character, i.e.,
        on <span class="Li">&quot;ord($char)%16&quot;</span>. In particular,
        characters <span class="Li">&quot;0&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;1&quot;</span> generate nybbles 0 and 1, as do
        bytes <span class="Li">&quot;\000&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;\001&quot;</span>. For characters
        <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;..&quot;f&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;A&quot;..&quot;F&quot;</span>, the result is
        compatible with the usual hexadecimal digits, so that
        <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;A&quot;</span> both generate the nybble
        <span class="Li">&quot;0xA==10&quot;</span>. Use only these specific hex
        characters with this format.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Starting from the beginning of the template to
        <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span>, each pair of characters is
        converted to 1 character of output. With format
        <span class="Li">&quot;h&quot;</span>, the first character of the pair
        determines the least-significant nybble of the output character; with
        format <span class="Li">&quot;H&quot;</span>, it determines the
        most-significant nybble.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the length of the input string is not even, it behaves as
        if padded by a null character at the end. Similarly, &quot;extra&quot;
        nybbles are ignored during unpacking.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the input string is longer than needed, extra characters
        are ignored.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> for the repeat count
        uses all characters of the input field. For
        <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span>, nybbles are converted to a
        string of hexadecimal digits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;p&quot;</span> format packs a pointer to a
      null-terminated string. You are responsible for ensuring that the string
      is not a temporary value, as that could potentially get deallocated before
      you got around to using the packed result. The
      <span class="Li">&quot;P&quot;</span> format packs a pointer to a
      structure of the size indicated by the length. A null pointer is created
      if the corresponding value for <span class="Li">&quot;p&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;P&quot;</span> is
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>; similarly with
      <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span>, where a null pointer unpacks
      into <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">If your system has a strange pointer size--meaning a pointer
        is neither as big as an int nor as big as a long--it may not be possible
        to pack or unpack pointers in big- or little-endian byte order.
        Attempting to do so raises an exception.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> template character allows
      packing and unpacking of a sequence of items where the packed structure
      contains a packed item count followed by the packed items themselves. This
      is useful when the structure you're unpacking has encoded the sizes or
      repeat counts for some of its fields within the structure itself as
      separate fields.
    <p class="Pp">For <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span>, you write
        <i>length-item</i><span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span><i>sequence-item</i>,
        and the <i>length-item</i> describes how the length value is packed.
        Formats likely to be of most use are integer-packing ones like
        <span class="Li">&quot;n&quot;</span> for Java strings,
        <span class="Li">&quot;w&quot;</span> for ASN.1 or SNMP, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;N&quot;</span> for Sun XDR.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span>,
        <i>sequence-item</i> may have a repeat count, in which case the minimum
        of that and the number of available items is used as the argument for
        <i>length-item</i>. If it has no repeat count or uses a '*', the number
        of available items is used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span>, an internal
        stack of integer arguments unpacked so far is used. You write
        <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span><i>sequence-item</i> and the repeat
        count is obtained by popping off the last element from the stack. The
        <i>sequence-item</i> must not have a repeat count.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <i>sequence-item</i> refers to a string type
        (<span class="Li">&quot;A&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;Z&quot;</span>), the <i>length-item</i> is the
        string length, not the number of strings. With an explicit repeat count
        for pack, the packed string is adjusted to that length. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> This code:                             gives this result:
 unpack(&quot;W/a&quot;, &quot;\004Gurusamy&quot;)          (&quot;Guru&quot;)
 unpack(&quot;a3/A A*&quot;, &quot;007 Bond  J &quot;)      (&quot; Bond&quot;, &quot;J&quot;)
 unpack(&quot;a3 x2 /A A*&quot;, &quot;007: Bond, J.&quot;) (&quot;Bond, J&quot;, &quot;.&quot;)
 pack(&quot;n/a* w/a&quot;,&quot;hello,&quot;,&quot;world&quot;)     &quot;\000\006hello,\005world&quot;
 pack(&quot;a/W2&quot;, ord(&quot;a&quot;) .. ord(&quot;z&quot;))    &quot;2ab&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The <i>length-item</i> is not returned explicitly from
        <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Supplying a count to the <i>length-item</i> format letter is
        only useful with <span class="Li">&quot;A&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;Z&quot;</span>. Packing with a <i>length-item</i>
        of <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;Z&quot;</span> may introduce
        <span class="Li">&quot;\000&quot;</span> characters, which Perl does not
        regard as legal in numeric strings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The integer types <span class="Li">&quot;s&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;S&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;l&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;L&quot;</span> may be followed by a
      <span class="Li">&quot;!&quot;</span> modifier to specify native shorts or
      longs. As shown in the example above, a bare
      <span class="Li">&quot;l&quot;</span> means exactly 32 bits, although the
      native <span class="Li">&quot;long&quot;</span> as seen by the local C
      compiler may be larger. This is mainly an issue on 64-bit platforms. You
      can see whether using <span class="Li">&quot;!&quot;</span> makes any
      difference this way:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    printf &quot;format s is %d, s! is %d\n&quot;,
        length pack(&quot;s&quot;), length pack(&quot;s!&quot;);
    printf &quot;format l is %d, l! is %d\n&quot;,

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;i!&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;I!&quot;</span> are also allowed, but only for
        completeness' sake: they are identical to

    <p class="Pp">Basically, Intel and VAX CPUs are little-endian, while
        everybody else, including Motorola m68k/88k, PPC, Sparc, HP PA, Power,
        and Cray, are big-endian. Alpha and MIPS can be either: Digital/Compaq
        uses (well, used) them in little-endian mode, but SGI/Cray uses them in
        big-endian mode.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The names <i>big-endian</i> and <i>little-endian</i> are comic
        references to the egg-eating habits of the little-endian Lilliputians
        and the big-endian Blefuscudians from the classic Jonathan Swift satire,
        <i>Gulliver's Travels</i>. This entered computer lingo via the paper
        &quot;On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace&quot; by Danny Cohen, USC/ISI
        IEN 137, April 1, 1980.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Some systems may have even weirder byte orders such as</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   0x56 0x78 0x12 0x34
   0x34 0x12 0x78 0x56
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">These are called mid-endian, middle-endian, mixed-endian, or
        just weird.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can determine your system endianness with this
        incantation:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   printf(&quot;%#02x &quot;, $_) for unpack(&quot;W*&quot;, pack L=&gt;0x12345678);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The byteorder on the platform where Perl was built is also
        available via Config:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Config;
    print &quot;$Config{byteorder}\n&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or from the command line:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $ perl -V:byteorder
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Byteorders <span class="Li">&quot;1234&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;12345678&quot;</span> are little-endian;
        <span class="Li">&quot;4321&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;87654321&quot;</span> are big-endian. Systems
        with multiarchitecture binaries will have
        <span class="Li">&quot;ffff&quot;</span>, signifying that static
        information doesn't work, one must use runtime probing.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For portably packed integers, either use the formats
        <span class="Li">&quot;n&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;N&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;v&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;V&quot;</span> or else use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span> modifiers described immediately
        below. See also perlport.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Also floating point numbers have endianness. Usually (but not always) this
      agrees with the integer endianness. Even though most platforms these days
      use the IEEE 754 binary format, there are differences, especially if the
      long doubles are involved. You can see the
      <span class="Li">&quot;Config&quot;</span> variables
      <span class="Li">&quot;doublekind&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;longdblkind&quot;</span> (also
      <span class="Li">&quot;doublesize&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;longdblsize&quot;</span>): the &quot;kind&quot;
      values are enums, unlike <span class="Li">&quot;byteorder&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Portability-wise the best option is probably to keep to the
        IEEE 754 64-bit doubles, and of agreed-upon endianness. Another
        possibility is the <span class="Li">&quot;%a&quot;</span>) format of
        <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Starting with Perl 5.10.0, integer and floating-point formats, along with
      the <span class="Li">&quot;p&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;P&quot;</span> formats and
      <span class="Li">&quot;()&quot;</span> groups, may all be followed by the
      <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span> endianness modifiers to
      respectively enforce big- or little-endian byte-order. These modifiers are
      especially useful given how <span class="Li">&quot;n&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;N&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;v&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;V&quot;</span> don't cover signed integers, 64-bit
      integers, or floating-point values.
    <p class="Pp">Here are some concerns to keep in mind when using an
        endianness modifier:</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Exchanging signed integers between different platforms works only when all
      platforms store them in the same format. Most platforms store signed
      integers in two's-complement notation, so usually this is not an
    issue.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span> modifiers can only be used on
      floating-point formats on big- or little-endian machines. Otherwise,
      attempting to use them raises an exception.</li>
  <li>Forcing big- or little-endian byte-order on floating-point values for data
      exchange can work only if all platforms use the same binary representation
      such as IEEE floating-point. Even if all platforms are using IEEE, there
      may still be subtle differences. Being able to use
      <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span> on floating-point values can be
      useful, but also dangerous if you don't know exactly what you're doing. It
      is not a general way to portably store floating-point values.</li>
  <li>When using <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span> on a
      <span class="Li">&quot;()&quot;</span> group, this affects all types
      inside the group that accept byte-order modifiers, including all
      subgroups. It is silently ignored for all other types. You are not allowed
      to override the byte-order within a group that already has a byte-order
      modifier suffix.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent"></div>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Real numbers (floats and doubles) are in native machine format only. Due
      to the multiplicity of floating-point formats and the lack of a standard
      &quot;network&quot; representation for them, no facility for interchange
      has been made. This means that packed floating-point data written on one
      machine may not be readable on another, even if both use IEEE
      floating-point arithmetic (because the endianness of the memory
      representation is not part of the IEEE spec). See also perlport.
    <p class="Pp">If you know <i>exactly</i> what you're doing, you can use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;&gt;&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&quot;</span> modifiers to force big- or
        little-endian byte-order on floating-point values.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Because Perl uses doubles (or long doubles, if configured)
        internally for all numeric calculation, converting from double into
        float and thence to double again loses precision, so
        <span class="Li">&quot;unpack(&quot;f&quot;, pack(&quot;f&quot;,
        $foo)&quot;</span>) will not in general equal
        <span class="Li">$foo</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Pack and unpack can operate in two modes: character mode
      (<span class="Li">&quot;C0&quot;</span> mode) where the packed string is
      processed per character, and UTF-8 byte mode
      (<span class="Li">&quot;U0&quot;</span> mode) where the packed string is
      processed in its UTF-8-encoded Unicode form on a byte-by-byte basis.
      Character mode is the default unless the format string starts with
      <span class="Li">&quot;U&quot;</span>. You can always switch mode
      mid-format with an explicit <span class="Li">&quot;C0&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;U0&quot;</span> in the format. This mode remains in
      effect until the next mode change, or until the end of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;()&quot;</span> group it (directly) applies to.
    <p class="Pp">Using <span class="Li">&quot;C0&quot;</span> to get Unicode
        characters while using <span class="Li">&quot;U0&quot;</span> to get
        <i>non</i>-Unicode bytes is not necessarily obvious. Probably only the
        first of these is what you want:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    $ perl -CS -E 'say &quot;\x{3B1}\x{3C9}&quot;' |
      perl -CS -ne 'printf &quot;%v04X\n&quot;, $_ for unpack(&quot;C0A*&quot;, $_)'
    03B1.03C9
    $ perl -CS -E 'say &quot;\x{3B1}\x{3C9}&quot;' |
      perl -CS -ne 'printf &quot;%v02X\n&quot;, $_ for unpack(&quot;U0A*&quot;, $_)'
    CE.B1.CF.89
    $ perl -CS -E 'say &quot;\x{3B1}\x{3C9}&quot;' |
      perl -C0 -ne 'printf &quot;%v02X\n&quot;, $_ for unpack(&quot;C0A*&quot;, $_)'
    CE.B1.CF.89
    $ perl -CS -E 'say &quot;\x{3B1}\x{3C9}&quot;' |
      perl -C0 -ne 'printf &quot;%v02X\n&quot;, $_ for unpack(&quot;U0A*&quot;, $_)'
    C3.8E.C2.B1.C3.8F.C2.89
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Those examples also illustrate that you should not try to use
        <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span>
        as a substitute for the Encode module.</p>
  </li>
  <li>You must yourself do any alignment or padding by inserting, for example,
      enough <span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span>es while packing. There is no
      way for <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span> to know where characters are
      going to or coming from, so they handle their output and input as flat
      sequences of characters.</li>
  <li>A <span class="Li">&quot;()&quot;</span> group is a sub-TEMPLATE enclosed
      in parentheses. A group may take a repeat count either as postfix, or for
      <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span>, also via the
      <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> template character. Within each
      repetition of a group, positioning with
      <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> starts over at 0. Therefore, the
      result of
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    pack(&quot;@1A((@2A)@3A)&quot;, qw[X Y Z])
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is the string
      <span class="Li">&quot;\0X\0\0YZ&quot;</span>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;x&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;X&quot;</span> accept the
      <span class="Li">&quot;!&quot;</span> modifier to act as alignment
      commands: they jump forward or back to the closest position aligned at a
      multiple of <span class="Li">&quot;count&quot;</span> characters. For
      example, to <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span> a C structure like
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    struct {
        char   c;    /* one signed, 8-bit character */
        double d;
        char   cc[2];
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">one may need to use the template <span class="Li">&quot;c
        x![d] d c[2]&quot;</span>. This assumes that doubles must be aligned to
        the size of double.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For alignment commands, a
        <span class="Li">&quot;count&quot;</span> of 0 is equivalent to a
        <span class="Li">&quot;count&quot;</span> of 1; both are no-ops.</p>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;n&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;N&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;v&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;V&quot;</span> accept the
      <span class="Li">&quot;!&quot;</span> modifier to represent signed
      16-/32-bit integers in big-/little-endian order. This is portable only
      when all platforms sharing packed data use the same binary representation
      for signed integers; for example, when all platforms use two's-complement
      representation.</li>
  <li>Comments can be embedded in a TEMPLATE using
      <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> through the end of line. White space
      can separate pack codes from each other, but modifiers and repeat counts
      must follow immediately. Breaking complex templates into individual
      line-by-line components, suitably annotated, can do as much to improve
      legibility and maintainability of pack/unpack formats as
      <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span> can for complicated pattern
      matches.</li>
  <li>If TEMPLATE requires more arguments than
      <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span> is given,
      <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span> assumes additional
      <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span> arguments. If TEMPLATE requires fewer
      arguments than given, extra arguments are ignored.</li>
  <li>Attempting to pack the special floating point values
      <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span> (infinity, also in negative, and
      not-a-number) into packed integer values (like
      <span class="Li">&quot;L&quot;</span>) is a fatal error. The reason for
      this is that there simply isn't any sensible mapping for these special
      values into integers.</li>

  <dd>Declares the BLOCK or the rest of the compilation unit as being in the

      itself through the end of current scope (the enclosing block, file, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>). That is, the forms without a

  <dt id="pos"><a class="permalink" href="#pos">pos</a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the offset of where the last
      <span class="Li">&quot;m//g&quot;</span> search left off for the variable
      in question (<span class="Li">$_</span> is used when the variable is not
      specified). This offset is in characters unless the
      (no-longer-recommended) <span class="Li">&quot;use bytes&quot;</span>
      pragma is in effect, in which case the offset is in bytes. Note that 0 is
      a valid match offset. <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> indicates
      that the search position is reset (usually due to match failure, but can
      also be because no match has yet been run on the scalar).
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;pos&quot;</span> directly accesses the
        location used by the regexp engine to store the offset, so assigning to
        <span class="Li">&quot;pos&quot;</span> will change that offset, and so
        will also influence the <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span>
        zero-width assertion in regular expressions. Both of these effects take
        place for the next match, so you can't affect the position with
        <span class="Li">&quot;pos&quot;</span> during the current match, such
        as in <span class="Li">&quot;(?{pos() = 5})&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;s//pos() = 5/e&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Setting <span class="Li">&quot;pos&quot;</span> also resets
        the <i>matched with</i> <i>zero-length</i> flag, described under
        &quot;Repeated Patterns Matching a Zero-length Substring&quot; in

    <p class="Pp">Because a failed <span class="Li">&quot;m//gc&quot;</span>

  <dt>print LIST</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="print"><a class="permalink" href="#print">print</a></dt>
  <dd>Prints a string or a list of strings. Returns true if successful.
      FILEHANDLE may be a scalar variable containing the name of or a reference
      to the filehandle, thus introducing one level of indirection. (NOTE: If
      FILEHANDLE is a variable and the next token is a term, it may be
      misinterpreted as an operator unless you interpose a
      <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span> or put parentheses around the
      arguments.) If FILEHANDLE is omitted, prints to the last selected (see
      <span class="Li">&quot;select&quot;</span>) output handle. If LIST is
      omitted, prints <span class="Li">$_</span> to the currently selected
      output handle. To use FILEHANDLE alone to print the content of
      <span class="Li">$_</span> to it, you must use a bareword filehandle like
      <span class="Li">&quot;FH&quot;</span>, not an indirect one like
      <span class="Li">$fh</span>. To set the default output handle to something
      other than STDOUT, use the select operation.
    <p class="Pp">The current value of <span class="Li">$,</span> (if any) is
        printed between each LIST item. The current value of
        <span class="Li">&quot;$\&quot;</span> (if any) is printed after the
        entire LIST has been printed. Because print takes a LIST, anything in
        the LIST is evaluated in list context, including any subroutines whose
        return lists you pass to <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span>. Be
        careful not to follow the print keyword with a left parenthesis unless
        you want the corresponding right parenthesis to terminate the arguments
        to the print; put parentheses around all arguments (or interpose a
        <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span>, but that doesn't look as
      good).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you're storing handles in an array or hash, or in general
        whenever you're using any expression more complex than a bareword handle
        or a plain, unsubscripted scalar variable to retrieve it, you will have
        to use a block returning the filehandle value instead, in which case the
        LIST may not be omitted:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    print { $files[$i] } &quot;stuff\n&quot;;
    print { $OK ? *STDOUT : *STDERR } &quot;stuff\n&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Printing to a closed pipe or socket will generate a SIGPIPE
        signal. See perlipc for more on signal handling.</p>

  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="printf"><a class="permalink" href="#printf">printf</a></dt>
  <dd>Equivalent to <span class="Li">&quot;print FILEHANDLE sprintf(FORMAT,
      LIST)&quot;</span>, except that <span class="Li">&quot;$\&quot;</span>
      (the output record separator) is not appended. The FORMAT and the LIST are
      actually parsed as a single list. The first argument of the list will be
      interpreted as the <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span> format. This
      means that <span class="Li">&quot;printf(@_)&quot;</span> will use
      <span class="Li">$_[0]</span> as the format. See sprintf for an
      explanation of the format argument. If <span class="Li">&quot;use
      locale&quot;</span> (including <span class="Li">&quot;use locale
      ':not_characters'&quot;</span>) is in effect and
      <span class="Li">&quot;POSIX::setlocale&quot;</span> has been called, the
      character used for the decimal separator in formatted floating-point
      numbers is affected by the <span class="Li">&quot;LC_NUMERIC&quot;</span>
      locale setting. See perllocale and POSIX.
    <p class="Pp">For historical reasons, if you omit the list,
        <span class="Li">$_</span> is used as the format; to use FILEHANDLE
        without a list, you must use a bareword filehandle like
        <span class="Li">&quot;FH&quot;</span>, not an indirect one like
        <span class="Li">$fh</span>. However, this will rarely do what you want;
        if <span class="Li">$_</span> contains formatting codes, they will be
        replaced with the empty string and a warning will be emitted if warnings
        are enabled. Just use <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span> if you
        want to print the contents of <span class="Li">$_</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Don't fall into the trap of using a
        <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span> when a simple
        <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span> would do. The
        <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span> is more efficient and less

  <dd>Returns the prototype of a function as a string (or

      prototype you want to retrieve. If FUNCTION is omitted,
      <span class="Li">$_</span> is used.
    <p class="Pp">If FUNCTION is a string starting with
        <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::&quot;</span>, the rest is taken as a name
        for a Perl builtin. If the builtin's arguments cannot be adequately
        expressed by a prototype (such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span>),
        <span class="Li">&quot;prototype&quot;</span> returns
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>, because the builtin does not
        really behave like a Perl function. Otherwise, the string describing the

      <span class="Li">&quot;/[A-Za-z_0-9]/&quot;</span> will be preceded by a
      backslash in the returned string, regardless of any locale settings.) This
      is the internal function implementing the

      (See below for the behavior on non-ASCII code points.)
    <p class="Pp">If EXPR is omitted, uses <span class="Li">$_</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">quotemeta (and <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span> ...
        <span class="Li">&quot;\E&quot;</span>) are useful when interpolating
        strings into regular expressions, because by default an interpolated
        variable will be considered a mini-regular expression. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog';
    my $substring = 'quick.*?fox';
    $sentence =~ s{$substring}{big bad wolf};
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Will cause <span class="Li">$sentence</span> to become
        <span class="Li">'The big bad wolf jumped over...'</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On the other hand:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog';
    my $substring = 'quick.*?fox';
    $sentence =~ s{\Q$substring\E}{big bad wolf};
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Or:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $sentence = 'The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog';
    my $substring = 'quick.*?fox';
    my $quoted_substring = quotemeta($substring);
    $sentence =~ s{$quoted_substring}{big bad wolf};
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Will both leave the sentence as is. Normally, when accepting
        literal string input from the user,
        <span class="Li">&quot;quotemeta&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span> must be used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Beware that if you put literal backslashes (those not inside
        interpolated variables) between <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span>
        and <span class="Li">&quot;\E&quot;</span>, double-quotish backslash
        interpolation may lead to confusing results. If you <i>need</i> to use
        literal backslashes within <span class="Li">&quot;\Q...\E&quot;</span>,
        consult &quot;Gory details of parsing quoted constructs&quot; in
      perlop.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Because the result of
        <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&#x00A0;</span><span class="Li"><i>STRING</i></span><span class="Li">&#x00A0;\E&quot;</span>
        has all metacharacters quoted, there is no way to insert a literal
        <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span> inside a
        <span class="Li">&quot;\Q\E&quot;</span> pair. If protected by
        <span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> will be quoted to become
        <span class="Li">&quot;\\\$&quot;</span>; if not, it is interpreted as
        the start of an interpolated scalar.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In Perl v5.14, all non-ASCII characters are quoted in
        non-UTF-8-encoded strings, but not quoted in UTF-8 strings.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Starting in Perl v5.16, Perl adopted a Unicode-defined
        strategy for quoting non-ASCII characters; the quoting of ASCII
        characters is unchanged.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also unchanged is the quoting of non-UTF-8 strings when
        outside the scope of a <span class="Li">&quot;use feature
        'unicode_strings'&quot;</span>, which is to quote all characters in the
        upper Latin1 range. This provides complete backwards compatibility for
        old programs which do not use Unicode. (Note that
        <span class="Li">&quot;unicode_strings&quot;</span> is automatically
        enabled within the scope of a
        <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;v5.12&quot;</span> or greater.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Within the scope of <span class="Li">&quot;use
        locale&quot;</span>, all non-ASCII Latin1 code points are quoted whether
        the string is encoded as UTF-8 or not. As mentioned above, locale does
        not affect the quoting of ASCII-range characters. This protects against
        those locales where characters such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span> are considered to be word
        characters.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Otherwise, Perl quotes non-ASCII characters using an
        adaptation from Unicode (see
        &lt;https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/&gt;). The only code points
        that are quoted are those that have any of the Unicode properties:
        Pattern_Syntax, Pattern_White_Space, White_Space,
        Default_Ignorable_Code_Point, or General_Category=Control.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Of these properties, the two important ones are Pattern_Syntax
        and Pattern_White_Space. They have been set up by Unicode for exactly
        this purpose of deciding which characters in a regular expression
        pattern should be quoted. No character that can be in an identifier has
        these properties.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl promises, that if we ever add regular expression pattern
        metacharacters to the dozen already defined (<span class="Li">&quot;\ |
        ( ) [ { ^ $ * + ? .&quot;</span>), that we will only use ones that have
        the Pattern_Syntax property. Perl also promises, that if we ever add
        characters that are considered to be white space in regular expressions
        (currently mostly affected by <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span>),
        they will all have the Pattern_White_Space property.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unicode promises that the set of code points that have these
        two properties will never change, so something that is not quoted in
        v5.16 will never need to be quoted in any future Perl release. (Not all
        the code points that match Pattern_Syntax have actually had characters
        assigned to them; so there is room to grow, but they are quoted whether
        assigned or not. Perl, of course, would never use an unassigned code
        point as an actual metacharacter.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Quoting characters that have the other 3 properties is done to
        enhance the readability of the regular expression and not because they
        actually need to be quoted for regular expression purposes (characters
        with the White_Space property are likely to be indistinguishable on the
        page or screen from those with the Pattern_White_Space property; and the
        other two properties contain non-printing characters).</p>

    <p class="Pp">An OFFSET may be specified to place the read data at some

        specifies placement at that many characters counting backwards from the

        results in the string being padded to the required size with

    <p class="Pp">The call is implemented in terms of either Perl's or your

    <p class="Pp">Note the <i>characters</i>: depending on the status of the

  <dd>Reads from the filehandle whose typeglob is contained in EXPR (or from

      each call reads and returns the next line until end-of-file is reached,
      whereupon the subsequent call returns
      <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>. In list context, reads until
      end-of-file is reached and returns a list of lines. Note that the notion
      of &quot;line&quot; used here is whatever you may have defined with

        should not be used to exit a <span class="Li">&quot;grep&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;map&quot;</span> operation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that a block by itself is semantically identical to a

  <dt>ref EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="ref"><a class="permalink" href="#ref">ref</a></dt>
  <dd>Examines the value of EXPR, expecting it to be a reference, and returns a
      string giving information about the reference and the type of referent. If
      EXPR is not specified, <span class="Li">$_</span> will be used.
    <p class="Pp">If the operand is not a reference, then the empty string will
        be returned. An empty string will only be returned in this situation.
        <span class="Li">&quot;ref&quot;</span> is often useful to just test
        whether a value is a reference, which can be done by comparing the
        result to the empty string. It is a common mistake to use the result of
        <span class="Li">&quot;ref&quot;</span> directly as a truth value: this
        goes wrong because <span class="Li">0</span> (which is false) can be
        returned for a reference.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the operand is a reference to a blessed object, then the
        name of the class into which the referent is blessed will be returned.
        <span class="Li">&quot;ref&quot;</span> doesn't care what the physical
        type of the referent is; blessing takes precedence over such concerns.
        Beware that exact comparison of <span class="Li">&quot;ref&quot;</span>
        results against a class name doesn't perform a class membership test: a
        class's members also include objects blessed into subclasses, for which
        <span class="Li">&quot;ref&quot;</span> will return the name of the
        subclass. Also beware that class names can clash with the built-in type
        names (described below).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the operand is a reference to an unblessed object, then the
        return value indicates the type of object. If the unblessed referent is
        not a scalar, then the return value will be one of the strings
        <span class="Li">&quot;ARRAY&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;HASH&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;CODE&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;FORMAT&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;IO&quot;</span>, indicating only which kind of
        object it is. If the unblessed referent is a scalar, then the return
        value will be one of the strings
        <span class="Li">&quot;SCALAR&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;VSTRING&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;REF&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;GLOB&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;LVALUE&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;REGEXP&quot;</span>, depending on the kind of
        value the scalar currently has. But note that
        <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span> scalars are created already
        blessed, so <span class="Li">&quot;ref qr/.../&quot;</span> will likely
        return <span class="Li">&quot;Regexp&quot;</span>. Beware that these
        built-in type names can also be used as class names, so
        <span class="Li">&quot;ref&quot;</span> returning one of these names
        doesn't unambiguously indicate that the referent is of the kind to which
        the name refers.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The ambiguity between built-in type names and class names
        significantly limits the utility of
        <span class="Li">&quot;ref&quot;</span>. For unambiguous information,
        use <span class="Li">&quot;Scalar::Util::blessed()&quot;</span> for
        information about blessing, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;Scalar::Util::reftype()&quot;</span> for
        information about physical types. Use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;isa&quot;</span> method for class membership
        tests, though one must be sure of blessedness before attempting a method
        call.</p>

    <p class="Pp">VERSION may be either a literal such as v5.24.1, which will be
        compared to <span class="Li">$^V</span> (or
        <span class="Li">$PERL_VERSION</span> in English), or a numeric argument
        of the form 5.024001, which will be compared to

        than the version of the current Perl interpreter. Compare with
        <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>, which can do a similar check at
        compile time.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Specifying VERSION as a numeric argument of the form 5.024001
        should generally be avoided as older less readable syntax compared to
        v5.24.1. Before perl 5.8.0 (released in 2002), the more verbose numeric
        form was the only supported syntax, which is why you might see it in
        older code.</p>

        }
        croak &quot;Can't locate $filename in \@INC ...&quot;;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the file will not be included twice under the same
        specified name.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The file must return true as the last statement to indicate
        successful execution of any initialization code, so it's customary to
        end such a file with <span class="Li">&quot;1;&quot;</span> unless
        you're sure it'll return true otherwise. But it's better just to put the
        <span class="Li">&quot;1;&quot;</span>, in case you add more
      statements.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If EXPR is a bareword,
        <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> assumes a <i>.pm</i>
        extension and replaces <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span> with
        <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> in the filename for you, to make
        it easy to load standard modules. This form of loading of modules does
        not risk altering your namespace, however it will autovivify the stash
        for the required module.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In other words, if you try this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        require Foo::Bar;     # a splendid bareword
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The require function will actually look for the
        <i>Foo/Bar.pm</i> file in the directories specified in the
        <span class="Li">@INC</span> array, and it will autovivify the
        <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::Bar::&quot;</span> stash at compile
      time.</p>
    <p class="Pp">But if you try this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        my $class = 'Foo::Bar';
        require $class;       # $class is not a bareword
    #or
        require &quot;Foo::Bar&quot;;   # not a bareword because of the &quot;&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The require function will look for the <i>Foo::Bar</i> file in
        the <span class="Li">@INC</span> array and will complain about not
        finding <i>Foo::Bar</i> there. In this case you can do:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        eval &quot;require $class&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or you could do</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        require &quot;Foo/Bar.pm&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Neither of these forms will autovivify any stashes at compile
        time and only have run time effects.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Now that you understand how
        <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> looks for files with a
        bareword argument, there is a little extra functionality going on behind
        the scenes. Before <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> looks for
        a <i>.pm</i> extension, it will first look for a similar filename with a
        <i>.pmc</i> extension. If this file is found, it will be loaded in place
        of any file ending in a <i>.pm</i> extension. This applies to both the
        explicit <span class="Li">&quot;require
        &quot;Foo/Bar.pm&quot;;&quot;</span> form and the
        <span class="Li">&quot;require Foo::Bar;&quot;</span> form.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can also insert hooks into the import facility by putting
        Perl code directly into the <span class="Li">@INC</span> array. There
        are three forms of hooks: subroutine references, array references, and
        blessed objects.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Subroutine references are the simplest case. When the
        inclusion system walks through <span class="Li">@INC</span> and
        encounters a subroutine, this subroutine gets called with two
        parameters, the first a reference to itself, and the second the name of
        the file to be included (e.g., <i>Foo/Bar.pm</i>). The subroutine should
        return either nothing or else a list of up to four values in the
        following order:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>A reference to a scalar, containing any initial source code to prepend to
      the file or generator output.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>A filehandle, from which the file will be read.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>A reference to a subroutine. If there is no filehandle (previous item),
      then this subroutine is expected to generate one line of source code per
      call, writing the line into <span class="Li">$_</span> and returning 1,
      then finally at end of file returning 0. If there is a filehandle, then
      the subroutine will be called to act as a simple source filter, with the
      line as read in <span class="Li">$_</span>. Again, return 1 for each valid
      line, and 0 after all lines have been returned. For historical reasons the
      subroutine will receive a meaningless argument (in fact always the numeric
      value zero) as <span class="Li">$_[0]</span>.</dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>Optional state for the subroutine. The state is passed in as

    filehandle (strictly a typeglob or reference to a typeglob, whether blessed
    or unblessed); tied filehandles will be ignored and processing will stop
    there.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the hook is an array reference, its first element must be a
    subroutine reference. This subroutine is called as above, but the first
    parameter is the array reference. This lets you indirectly pass arguments to
    the subroutine.</p>
<p class="Pp">In other words, you can write:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    push @INC, \&amp;my_sub;

        # Retrieve $x, $y, ...
        my (undef, @parameters) = @$arrayref;
        ...
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If the hook is an object, it must provide an
    <span class="Li">&quot;INC&quot;</span> method that will be called as above,
    the first parameter being the object itself. (Note that you must fully
    qualify the sub's name, as unqualified
    <span class="Li">&quot;INC&quot;</span> is always forced into package
    <span class="Li">&quot;main&quot;</span>.) Here is a typical code
  layout:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    # In Foo.pm
    package Foo;
    sub new { ... }
    sub Foo::INC {
        my ($self, $filename) = @_;
        ...
    }
    # In the main program
    push @INC, Foo-&gt;new(...);

    <p class="Pp">There is no equivalent operator to force an expression to be

        If you really wanted to do so, however, you could use the construction

    <p class="Pp">Because <span class="Li">&quot;scalar&quot;</span> is a unary

  <dt id="seek"><a class="permalink" href="#seek">seek
    FILEHANDLE,POSITION,WHENCE</a></dt>
  <dd>Sets FILEHANDLE's position, just like the <b>fseek</b>(3) call of C
      <span class="Li">&quot;stdio&quot;</span>. FILEHANDLE may be an expression
      whose value gives the name of the filehandle. The values for WHENCE are
      <span class="Li">0</span> to set the new position <i>in bytes</i> to
      POSITION; <span class="Li">1</span> to set it to the current position plus
      POSITION; and <span class="Li">2</span> to set it to EOF plus POSITION,
      typically negative. For WHENCE you may use the constants
      <span class="Li">&quot;SEEK_SET&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;SEEK_CUR&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;SEEK_END&quot;</span> (start of the file, current
      position, end of the file) from the Fcntl module. Returns
      <span class="Li">1</span> on success, false otherwise.
    <p class="Pp">Note the emphasis on bytes: even if the filehandle has been
        set to operate on characters (for example using the
        <span class="Li">&quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;</span> I/O layer), the
        <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysseek&quot;</span> family of functions use byte
        offsets, not character offsets, because seeking to a character offset
        would be very slow in a UTF-8 file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you want to position the file for
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysread&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;syswrite&quot;</span>, don't use
        <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span>, because buffering makes its
        effect on the file's read-write position unpredictable and non-portable.
        Use <span class="Li">&quot;sysseek&quot;</span> instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Due to the rules and rigors of ANSI C, on some systems you
        have to do a seek whenever you switch between reading and writing.
        Amongst other things, this may have the effect of calling stdio's
        <b>clearerr</b>(3). A WHENCE of <span class="Li">1</span>
        (<span class="Li">&quot;SEEK_CUR&quot;</span>) is useful for not moving
        the file position:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    seek($fh, 0, 1);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This is also useful for applications emulating
        <span class="Li">&quot;tail -f&quot;</span>. Once you hit EOF on your
        read and then sleep for a while, you (probably) have to stick in a dummy
        <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span> to reset things. The
        <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span> doesn't change the position,
        but it <i>does</i> clear the end-of-file condition on the handle, so
        that the next <span class="Li">&quot;readline FILE&quot;</span> makes
        Perl try again to read something. (We hope.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If that doesn't work (some I/O implementations are
        particularly cantankerous), you might need something like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    for (;;) {
        for ($curpos = tell($fh); $_ = readline($fh);
             $curpos = tell($fh)) {

      refer to this output channel.
    <p class="Pp">For example, to set the top-of-form format for more than one

  <dd>In list context, this sorts the LIST and returns the sorted list value. In

      is undefined.
    <p class="Pp">If SUBNAME or BLOCK is omitted,
        <span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span>s in standard string comparison
        order. If SUBNAME is specified, it gives the name of a subroutine that
        returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than
        <span class="Li">0</span>, depending on how the elements of the list are
        to be ordered. (The <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;cmp&quot;</span> operators are extremely useful
        in such routines.) SUBNAME may be a scalar variable name
        (unsubscripted), in which case the value provides the name of (or a
        reference to) the actual subroutine to use. In place of a SUBNAME, you
        can provide a BLOCK as an anonymous, in-line sort subroutine.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the subroutine's prototype is
        <span class="Li">&quot;($$)&quot;</span>, the elements to be compared
        are passed by reference in <span class="Li">@_</span>, as for a normal
        subroutine. This is slower than unprototyped subroutines, where the
        elements to be compared are passed into the subroutine as the package
        global variables <span class="Li">$a</span> and
        <span class="Li">$b</span> (see example below).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the subroutine is an XSUB, the elements to be compared are
        pushed on to the stack, the way arguments are usually passed to XSUBs.
        <span class="Li">$a</span> and <span class="Li">$b</span> are not
      set.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The values to be compared are always passed by reference and
        should not be modified.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You also cannot exit out of the sort block or subroutine using
        any of the loop control operators described in perlsyn or with
        <span class="Li">&quot;goto&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> (but not
        <span class="Li">&quot;use locale ':not_characters'&quot;</span>) is in
        effect, <span class="Li">&quot;sort LIST&quot;</span> sorts LIST
        according to the current collation locale. See perllocale.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span> returns aliases into
        the original list, much as a for loop's index variable aliases the list
        elements. That is, modifying an element of a list returned by
        <span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span> (for example, in a
        <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;map&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;grep&quot;</span>) actually modifies the element
        in the original list. This is usually something to be avoided when
        writing clear code.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Historically Perl has varied in whether sorting is stable by
        default. If stability matters, it can be controlled explicitly by using
        the sort pragma.</p>

  <dd>Splits the string EXPR into a list of strings and returns the list in list
      context, or the size of the list in scalar context. (Prior to Perl 5.11,
      it also overwrote <span class="Li">@_</span> with the list in void and
      scalar context. If you target old perls, beware.)
    <p class="Pp">If only PATTERN is given, EXPR defaults to
        <span class="Li">$_</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Anything in EXPR that matches PATTERN is taken to be a
        separator that separates the EXPR into substrings (called
        &quot;<i>fields</i>&quot;) that do <b>not</b> include the separator.
        Note that a separator may be longer than one character or even have no
        characters at all (the empty string, which is a zero-width match).</p>
    <p class="Pp">The PATTERN need not be constant; an expression may be used to
        specify a pattern that varies at runtime.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If PATTERN matches the empty string, the EXPR is split at the
        match position (between characters). As an example, the following:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @x = split(/b/, &quot;abc&quot;); # (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">uses the <span class="Li">&quot;b&quot;</span> in
        <span class="Li">'abc'</span> as a separator to produce the list
        (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;). However, this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @x = split(//, &quot;abc&quot;); # (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">uses empty string matches as separators; thus, the empty
        string may be used to split EXPR into a list of its component
        characters.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As a special case for
        <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span>, the empty pattern given in
        match operator syntax (<span class="Li">&quot;//&quot;</span>)
        specifically matches the empty string, which is contrary to its usual
        interpretation as the last successful match.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If PATTERN is <span class="Li">&quot;/^/&quot;</span>, then it
        is treated as if it used the multiline modifier
        (<span class="Li">&quot;/^/m&quot;</span>), since it isn't much use
        otherwise.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> and any of the other
        pattern modifiers valid for <span class="Li">&quot;qr&quot;</span>
        (summarized in &quot;qr/STRING/msixpodualn&quot; in perlop) may be
        specified explicitly.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As another special case,
        <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span> emulates the default behavior
        of the command line tool <b>awk</b> when the PATTERN is either omitted
        or a string composed of a single space character (such as
        <span class="Li">'&#x00A0;'</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;\x20&quot;</span>, but not e.g.
        <span class="Li">&quot;/&#x00A0;/&quot;</span>). In this case, any
        leading whitespace in EXPR is removed before splitting occurs, and the
        PATTERN is instead treated as if it were
        <span class="Li">&quot;/\s+/&quot;</span>; in particular, this means
        that <i>any</i> contiguous whitespace (not just a single space
        character) is used as a separator.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @x = split(&quot; &quot;, &quot;  Quick brown fox\n&quot;);
    # (&quot;Quick&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;, &quot;fox&quot;)
    my @x = split(&quot; &quot;, &quot;RED\tGREEN\tBLUE&quot;);
    # (&quot;RED&quot;, &quot;GREEN&quot;, &quot;BLUE&quot;)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Using split in this fashion is very similar to how
        <span class="Li">&quot;qw//&quot;</span> works.</p>
    <p class="Pp">However, this special treatment can be avoided by specifying
        the pattern <span class="Li">&quot;/&#x00A0;/&quot;</span> instead of
        the string <span class="Li">&quot;&#x00A0;&quot;</span>, thereby
        allowing only a single space character to be a separator. In earlier
        Perls this special case was restricted to the use of a plain
        <span class="Li">&quot;&#x00A0;&quot;</span> as the pattern argument to
        split; in Perl 5.18.0 and later this special case is triggered by any
        expression which evaluates to the simple string
        <span class="Li">&quot;&#x00A0;&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.28, this special-cased whitespace splitting works
        as expected in the scope of
        <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;feature&#x00A0;'unicode_strings'&quot;</span>.
        In previous versions, and outside the scope of that feature, it exhibits
        &quot;The &quot;Unicode Bug&quot;&quot; in perlunicode: characters that
        are whitespace according to Unicode rules but not according to ASCII
        rules can be treated as part of fields rather than as field separators,
        depending on the string's internal encoding.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If omitted, PATTERN defaults to a single space,
        <span class="Li">&quot;&#x00A0;&quot;</span>, triggering the previously
        described <i>awk</i> emulation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If LIMIT is specified and positive, it represents the maximum
        number of fields into which the EXPR may be split; in other words, LIMIT
        is one greater than the maximum number of times EXPR may be split. Thus,
        the LIMIT value <span class="Li">1</span> means that EXPR may be split a
        maximum of zero times, producing a maximum of one field (namely, the
        entire value of EXPR). For instance:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @x = split(//, &quot;abc&quot;, 1); # (&quot;abc&quot;)
    my @x = split(//, &quot;abc&quot;, 2); # (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;bc&quot;)
    my @x = split(//, &quot;abc&quot;, 3); # (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)
    my @x = split(//, &quot;abc&quot;, 4); # (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If LIMIT is negative, it is treated as if it were instead
        arbitrarily large; as many fields as possible are produced.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If LIMIT is omitted (or, equivalently, zero), then it is
        usually treated as if it were instead negative but with the exception
        that trailing empty fields are stripped (empty leading fields are always
        preserved); if all fields are empty, then all fields are considered to
        be trailing (and are thus stripped in this case). Thus, the
      following:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @x = split(/,/, &quot;a,b,c,,,&quot;); # (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">produces only a three element list.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @x = split(/,/, &quot;a,b,c,,,&quot;, -1); # (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">produces a six element list.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In time-critical applications, it is worthwhile to avoid
        splitting into more fields than necessary. Thus, when assigning to a
        list, if LIMIT is omitted (or zero), then LIMIT is treated as though it
        were one larger than the number of variables in the list; for the
        following, LIMIT is implicitly 3:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my ($login, $passwd) = split(/:/);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that splitting an EXPR that evaluates to the empty string
        always produces zero fields, regardless of the LIMIT specified.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An empty leading field is produced when there is a
        positive-width match at the beginning of EXPR. For instance:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @x = split(/ /, &quot; abc&quot;); # (&quot;&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">splits into two elements. However, a zero-width match at the
        beginning of EXPR never produces an empty field, so that:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @x = split(//, &quot; abc&quot;); # (&quot; &quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">splits into four elements instead of five.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An empty trailing field, on the other hand, is produced when
        there is a match at the end of EXPR, regardless of the length of the
        match (of course, unless a non-zero LIMIT is given explicitly, such
        fields are removed, as in the last example). Thus:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @x = split(//, &quot; abc&quot;, -1); # (&quot; &quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the PATTERN contains capturing groups, then for each
        separator, an additional field is produced for each substring captured
        by a group (in the order in which the groups are specified, as per
        backreferences); if any group does not match, then it captures the
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> value instead of a substring.
        Also, note that any such additional field is produced whenever there is
        a separator (that is, whenever a split occurs), and such an additional
        field does <b>not</b> count towards the LIMIT. Consider the following
        expressions evaluated in list context (each returned list is provided in
        the associated comment):</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my @x = split(/-|,/    , &quot;1-10,20&quot;, 3);
    # (&quot;1&quot;, &quot;10&quot;, &quot;20&quot;)
    my @x = split(/(-|,)/  , &quot;1-10,20&quot;, 3);

      an explanation of the general principles.
    <p class="Pp">For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>        # Format number with up to 8 leading zeroes
        my $result = sprintf(&quot;%08d&quot;, $number);
        # Round number to 3 digits after decimal point
        my $rounded = sprintf(&quot;%.3f&quot;, $number);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Perl does its own <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span>
        formatting: it emulates the C function <b>sprintf</b>(3), but doesn't
        use it except for floating-point numbers, and even then only standard
        modifiers are allowed. Non-standard extensions in your local
        <b>sprintf</b>(3) are therefore unavailable from Perl.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unlike <span class="Li">&quot;printf&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span> does not do what you
        probably mean when you pass it an array as your first argument. The
        array is given scalar context, and instead of using the 0th element of
        the array as the format, Perl will use the count of elements in the
        array as the format, which is almost never useful.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl's <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span> permits the
        following universally-known conversions:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   %%    a percent sign
   %c    a character with the given number
   %s    a string
   %d    a signed integer, in decimal
   %u    an unsigned integer, in decimal
   %o    an unsigned integer, in octal
   %x    an unsigned integer, in hexadecimal
   %e    a floating-point number, in scientific notation
   %f    a floating-point number, in fixed decimal notation
   %g    a floating-point number, in %e or %f notation
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In addition, Perl permits the following widely-supported
        conversions:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   %X    like %x, but using upper-case letters
   %E    like %e, but using an upper-case &quot;E&quot;
   %G    like %g, but with an upper-case &quot;E&quot; (if applicable)
   %b    an unsigned integer, in binary
   %B    like %b, but using an upper-case &quot;B&quot; with the # flag
   %p    a pointer (outputs the Perl value's address in hexadecimal)
   %n    special: *stores* the number of characters output so far
         into the next argument in the parameter list
   %a    hexadecimal floating point
   %A    like %a, but using upper-case letters
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Finally, for backward (and we do mean &quot;backward&quot;)
        compatibility, Perl permits these unnecessary but widely-supported
        conversions:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   %i    a synonym for %d
   %D    a synonym for %ld
   %U    a synonym for %lu
   %O    a synonym for %lo
   %F    a synonym for %f
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the number of exponent digits in the scientific
        notation produced by <span class="Li">%e</span>,
        <span class="Li">%E</span>, <span class="Li">%g</span> and
        <span class="Li">%G</span> for numbers with the modulus of the exponent
        less than 100 is system-dependent: it may be three or less (zero-padded
        as necessary). In other words, 1.23 times ten to the 99th may be either
        &quot;1.23e99&quot; or &quot;1.23e099&quot;. Similarly for
        <span class="Li">%a</span> and <span class="Li">%A</span>: the exponent
        or the hexadecimal digits may float: especially the &quot;long
        doubles&quot; Perl configuration option may cause surprises.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Between the <span class="Li">&quot;%&quot;</span> and the
        format letter, you may specify several additional attributes controlling
        the interpretation of the format. In order, these are:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>format parameter index</dt>
  <dd>An explicit format parameter index, such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;2$&quot;</span>. By default sprintf will format the
      next unused argument in the list, but this allows you to take the
      arguments out of order:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf '%2$d %1$d', 12, 34;      # prints &quot;34 12&quot;
  printf '%3$d %d %1$d', 1, 2, 3;  # prints &quot;3 1 1&quot;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="flags"><a class="permalink" href="#flags">flags</a></dt>
  <dd>one or more of:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   space   prefix non-negative number with a space
   +       prefix non-negative number with a plus sign
   -       left-justify within the field
   0       use zeros, not spaces, to right-justify
   #       ensure the leading &quot;0&quot; for any octal,
           prefix non-zero hexadecimal with &quot;0x&quot; or &quot;0X&quot;,
           prefix non-zero binary with &quot;0b&quot; or &quot;0B&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf '&lt;% d&gt;',  12;   # prints &quot;&lt; 12&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;% d&gt;',   0;   # prints &quot;&lt; 0&gt;&quot;

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">When a space and a plus sign are given as the flags at once,

    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="vector"><a class="permalink" href="#vector">vector flag</a></dt>
  <dd>This flag tells Perl to interpret the supplied string as a vector of
      integers, one for each character in the string. Perl applies the format to
      each integer in turn, then joins the resulting strings with a separator (a
      dot <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> by default). This can be useful
      for displaying ordinal values of characters in arbitrary strings:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf &quot;%vd&quot;, &quot;AB\x{100}&quot;;           # prints &quot;65.66.256&quot;
  printf &quot;version is v%vd\n&quot;, $^V;     # Perl's version
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Put an asterisk <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> before
        the <span class="Li">&quot;v&quot;</span> to override the string to use
        to separate the numbers:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf &quot;address is %*vX\n&quot;, &quot;:&quot;, $addr;   # IPv6 address
  printf &quot;bits are %0*v8b\n&quot;, &quot; &quot;, $bits;   # random bitstring
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can also explicitly specify the argument number to use for
        the join string using something like
        <span class="Li">&quot;*2$v&quot;</span>; for example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf '%*4$vX %*4$vX %*4$vX',       # 3 IPv6 addresses
          @addr[1..3], &quot;:&quot;;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>(minimum) width</dt>
  <dd>Arguments are usually formatted to be only as wide as required to display
      the given value. You can override the width by putting a number here, or
      get the width from the next argument (with
      <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>) or from a specified argument (e.g.,
      with <span class="Li">&quot;*2$&quot;</span>):
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> printf &quot;&lt;%s&gt;&quot;, &quot;a&quot;;       # prints &quot;&lt;a&gt;&quot;
 printf &quot;&lt;%6s&gt;&quot;, &quot;a&quot;;      # prints &quot;&lt;     a&gt;&quot;
 printf &quot;&lt;%*s&gt;&quot;, 6, &quot;a&quot;;   # prints &quot;&lt;     a&gt;&quot;
 printf '&lt;%*2$s&gt;', &quot;a&quot;, 6; # prints &quot;&lt;     a&gt;&quot;
 printf &quot;&lt;%2s&gt;&quot;, &quot;long&quot;;   # prints &quot;&lt;long&gt;&quot; (does not truncate)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If a field width obtained through
        <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> is negative, it has the same
        effect as the <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span> flag:
        left-justification.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="precision,"><a class="permalink" href="#precision,">precision, or
    maximum width</a></dt>
  <dd>You can specify a precision (for numeric conversions) or a maximum width
      (for string conversions) by specifying a
      <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> followed by a number. For
      floating-point formats except <span class="Li">&quot;g&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;G&quot;</span>, this specifies how many places
      right of the decimal point to show (the default being 6). For example:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  # these examples are subject to system-specific variation
  printf '&lt;%f&gt;', 1;    # prints &quot;&lt;1.000000&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%.1f&gt;', 1;  # prints &quot;&lt;1.0&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%.0f&gt;', 1;  # prints &quot;&lt;1&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%e&gt;', 10;   # prints &quot;&lt;1.000000e+01&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%.1e&gt;', 10; # prints &quot;&lt;1.0e+01&gt;&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For &quot;g&quot; and &quot;G&quot;, this specifies the
        maximum number of significant digits to show; for example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  # These examples are subject to system-specific variation.
  printf '&lt;%g&gt;', 1;        # prints &quot;&lt;1&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%.10g&gt;', 1;     # prints &quot;&lt;1&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%g&gt;', 100;      # prints &quot;&lt;100&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%.1g&gt;', 100;    # prints &quot;&lt;1e+02&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%.2g&gt;', 100.01; # prints &quot;&lt;1e+02&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%.5g&gt;', 100.01; # prints &quot;&lt;100.01&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%.4g&gt;', 100.01; # prints &quot;&lt;100&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%.1g&gt;', 0.0111; # prints &quot;&lt;0.01&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%.2g&gt;', 0.0111; # prints &quot;&lt;0.011&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%.3g&gt;', 0.0111; # prints &quot;&lt;0.0111&gt;&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For integer conversions, specifying a precision implies that
        the output of the number itself should be zero-padded to this width,
        where the 0 flag is ignored:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf '&lt;%.6d&gt;', 1;      # prints &quot;&lt;000001&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%+.6d&gt;', 1;     # prints &quot;&lt;+000001&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%-10.6d&gt;', 1;   # prints &quot;&lt;000001    &gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%10.6d&gt;', 1;    # prints &quot;&lt;    000001&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%010.6d&gt;', 1;   # prints &quot;&lt;    000001&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%+10.6d&gt;', 1;   # prints &quot;&lt;   +000001&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%.6x&gt;', 1;      # prints &quot;&lt;000001&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%#.6x&gt;', 1;     # prints &quot;&lt;0x000001&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%-10.6x&gt;', 1;   # prints &quot;&lt;000001    &gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%10.6x&gt;', 1;    # prints &quot;&lt;    000001&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%010.6x&gt;', 1;   # prints &quot;&lt;    000001&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%#10.6x&gt;', 1;   # prints &quot;&lt;  0x000001&gt;&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For string conversions, specifying a precision truncates the
        string to fit the specified width:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf '&lt;%.5s&gt;', &quot;truncated&quot;;   # prints &quot;&lt;trunc&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%10.5s&gt;', &quot;truncated&quot;; # prints &quot;&lt;     trunc&gt;&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can also get the precision from the next argument using
        <span class="Li">&quot;.*&quot;</span>, or from a specified argument
        (e.g., with <span class="Li">&quot;.*2$&quot;</span>):</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf '&lt;%.6x&gt;', 1;       # prints &quot;&lt;000001&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%.*x&gt;', 6, 1;    # prints &quot;&lt;000001&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%.*2$x&gt;', 1, 6;  # prints &quot;&lt;000001&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%6.*2$x&gt;', 1, 4; # prints &quot;&lt;  0001&gt;&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If a precision obtained through
        <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> is negative, it counts as having
        no precision at all.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf '&lt;%.*s&gt;',  7, &quot;string&quot;;   # prints &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%.*s&gt;',  3, &quot;string&quot;;   # prints &quot;&lt;str&gt;&quot;

  printf '&lt;%.*d&gt;',  1, 0;   # prints &quot;&lt;0&gt;&quot;
  printf '&lt;%.*d&gt;',  0, 0;   # prints &quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;

    </pre>

  <dt id="size"><a class="permalink" href="#size">size</a></dt>

      (<span class="Li">&quot;d u o x X b i D U O&quot;</span>), numbers are
      usually assumed to be whatever the default integer size is on your
      platform (usually 32 or 64 bits), but you can override this to use instead
      one of the standard C types, as supported by the compiler used to build
      Perl:

   j           interpret integer as C type &quot;intmax_t&quot; on Perl
               5.14 or later; and prior to Perl 5.30, only with
               a C99 compiler (unportable)
   l           interpret integer as C type &quot;long&quot; or
               &quot;unsigned long&quot;
   q, L, or ll interpret integer as C type &quot;long long&quot;,
               &quot;unsigned long long&quot;, or &quot;quad&quot; (typically
               64-bit integers)
   t           interpret integer as C type &quot;ptrdiff_t&quot; on Perl
               5.14 or later
   z           interpret integer as C types &quot;size_t&quot; or

      the order they appear in the format specification <i>before</i> the value
      to format. Where an argument is specified by an explicit index, this does
      not affect the normal order for the arguments, even when the explicitly
      specified index would have been the next argument.
    <p class="Pp">So:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    printf &quot;&lt;%*.*s&gt;&quot;, $a, $b, $c;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">uses <span class="Li">$a</span> for the width,
        <span class="Li">$b</span> for the precision, and
        <span class="Li">$c</span> as the value to format; while:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf '&lt;%*1$.*s&gt;', $a, $b;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">would use <span class="Li">$a</span> for the width and
        precision, and <span class="Li">$b</span> as the value to format.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here are some more examples; be aware that when using an
        explicit index, the <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> may need
        escaping:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> printf &quot;%2\$d %d\n&quot;,      12, 34;     # will print &quot;34 12\n&quot;

  <dd>Sets and returns the random number seed for the
      <span class="Li">&quot;rand&quot;</span> operator.
    <p class="Pp">The point of the function is to &quot;seed&quot; the
        <span class="Li">&quot;rand&quot;</span> function so that
        <span class="Li">&quot;rand&quot;</span> can produce a different
        sequence each time you run your program. When called with a parameter,
        <span class="Li">&quot;srand&quot;</span> uses that for the seed;
        otherwise it (semi-)randomly chooses a seed. In either case, starting
        with Perl 5.14, it returns the seed. To signal that your code will work
        <i>only</i> on Perls of a recent vintage:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use 5.014;  # so srand returns the seed
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;srand&quot;</span> is not called
        explicitly, it is called implicitly without a parameter at the first use
        of the <span class="Li">&quot;rand&quot;</span> operator. However, there
        are a few situations where programs are likely to want to call
        <span class="Li">&quot;srand&quot;</span>. One is for generating
        predictable results, generally for testing or debugging. There, you use
        <span class="Li">&quot;srand($seed)&quot;</span>, with the same
        <span class="Li">$seed</span> each time. Another case is that you may
        want to call <span class="Li">&quot;srand&quot;</span> after a
        <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span> to avoid child processes
        sharing the same seed value as the parent (and consequently each
      other).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Do <b>not</b> call <span class="Li">&quot;srand()&quot;</span>
        (i.e., without an argument) more than once per process. The internal
        state of the random number generator should contain more entropy than
        can be provided by any seed, so calling
        <span class="Li">&quot;srand&quot;</span> again actually <i>loses</i>
        randomness.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Most implementations of
        <span class="Li">&quot;srand&quot;</span> take an integer and will
        silently truncate decimal numbers. This means
        <span class="Li">&quot;srand(42)&quot;</span> will usually produce the
        same results as <span class="Li">&quot;srand(42.1)&quot;</span>. To be
        safe, always pass <span class="Li">&quot;srand&quot;</span> an
      integer.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A typical use of the returned seed is for a test program which
        has too many combinations to test comprehensively in the time available
        to it each run. It can test a random subset each time, and should there
        be a failure, log the seed used for that run so that it can later be
        used to reproduce the same results.</p>

    <p class="Pp">Not all fields are supported on all filesystem types. Here are
        the meanings of the fields:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  0 dev      device number of filesystem
  1 ino      inode number
  2 mode     file mode  (type and permissions)
  3 nlink    number of (hard) links to the file
  4 uid      numeric user ID of file's owner
  5 gid      numeric group ID of file's owner
  6 rdev     the device identifier (special files only)
  7 size     total size of file, in bytes
  8 atime    last access time in seconds since the epoch
  9 mtime    last modify time in seconds since the epoch
 10 ctime    inode change time in seconds since the epoch (*)
 11 blksize  preferred I/O size in bytes for interacting with the
             file (may vary from file to file)
 12 blocks   actual number of system-specific blocks allocated
             on disk (often, but not always, 512 bytes each)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(The epoch was at 00:00 January 1, 1970 GMT.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">(*) Not all fields are supported on all filesystem types.
        Notably, the ctime field is non-portable. In particular, you cannot
        expect it to be a &quot;creation time&quot;; see &quot;Files and
        Filesystems&quot; in perlport for details.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span> is passed the
        special filehandle consisting of an underline, no stat is done, but the
        current contents of the stat structure from the last
        <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;lstat&quot;</span>, or filetest are returned.
        Example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    if (-x $file &amp;&amp; (($d) = stat(_)) &amp;&amp; $d &lt; 0) {
        print &quot;$file is executable NFS file\n&quot;;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">(This works on machines only for which the device number is
        negative under NFS.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">On some platforms inode numbers are of a type larger than perl
        knows how to handle as integer numerical values. If necessary, an inode
        number will be returned as a decimal string in order to preserve the
        entire value. If used in a numeric context, this will be converted to a
        floating-point numerical value, with rounding, a fate that is best
        avoided. Therefore, you should prefer to compare inode numbers using
        <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> rather than
        <span class="Li">&quot;==&quot;</span>.
        <span class="Li">&quot;eq&quot;</span> will work fine on inode numbers
        that are represented numerically, as well as those represented as
        strings.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Because the mode contains both the file type and its
        permissions, you should mask off the file type portion and (s)printf
        using a <span class="Li">&quot;%o&quot;</span> if you want to see the
        real permissions.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $mode = (stat($filename))[2];
    printf &quot;Permissions are %04o\n&quot;, $mode &amp; 07777;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In scalar context, <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span>
        returns a boolean value indicating success or failure, and, if
        successful, sets the information associated with the special filehandle
        <span class="Li">&quot;_&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The File::stat module provides a convenient, by-name access
        mechanism:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use File::stat;
    my $sb = stat($filename);
    printf &quot;File is %s, size is %s, perm %04o, mtime %s\n&quot;,
           $filename, $sb-&gt;size, $sb-&gt;mode &amp; 07777,
           scalar localtime $sb-&gt;mtime;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can import symbolic mode constants
        (<span class="Li">&quot;S_IF*&quot;</span>) and functions
        (<span class="Li">&quot;S_IS*&quot;</span>) from the Fcntl module:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Fcntl ':mode';

    my $user_rwx      = ($mode &amp; S_IRWXU) &gt;&gt; 6;

      offset zero. If OFFSET is negative, starts that far back from the end of
      the string. If LENGTH is omitted, returns everything through the end of
      the string. If LENGTH is negative, leaves that many characters off the end
      of the string.

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can use the <span class="Li">&quot;substr&quot;</span>
        function as an lvalue, in which case EXPR must itself be an lvalue. If
        you assign something shorter than LENGTH, the string will shrink, and if
        you assign something longer than LENGTH, the string will grow to
        accommodate it. To keep the string the same length, you may need to pad
        or chop your value using
      <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If OFFSET and LENGTH specify a substring that is partly
        outside the string, only the part within the string is returned. If the
        substring is beyond either end of the string,
        <span class="Li">&quot;substr&quot;</span> returns the undefined value
        and produces a warning. When used as an lvalue, specifying a substring
        that is entirely outside the string raises an exception. Here's an
        example showing the behavior for boundary cases:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $name = 'fred';
    substr($name, 4) = 'dy';         # $name is now 'freddy'
    my $null = substr $name, 6, 2;   # returns &quot;&quot; (no warning)
    my $oops = substr $name, 7;      # returns undef, with warning
    substr($name, 7) = 'gap';        # raises an exception
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">An alternative to using
        <span class="Li">&quot;substr&quot;</span> as an lvalue is to specify
        the replacement string as the 4th argument. This allows you to replace
        parts of the EXPR and return what was there before in one operation,
        just as you can with <span class="Li">&quot;splice&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $s = &quot;The black cat climbed the green tree&quot;;
    my $z = substr $s, 14, 7, &quot;jumped from&quot;;    # climbed
    # $s is now &quot;The black cat jumped from the green tree&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the lvalue returned by the three-argument version of
        <span class="Li">&quot;substr&quot;</span> acts as a 'magic bullet';
        each time it is assigned to, it remembers which part of the original
        string is being modified; for example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $x = '1234';
    for (substr($x,1,2)) {
        $_ = 'a';   print $x,&quot;\n&quot;;    # prints 1a4
        $_ = 'xyz'; print $x,&quot;\n&quot;;    # prints 1xyz4
        $x = '56789';
        $_ = 'pq';  print $x,&quot;\n&quot;;    # prints 5pq9
    }
    </pre>

  <dd>Calls the system call specified as the first element of the list, passing
      the remaining elements as arguments to the system call. If unimplemented,
      raises an exception. The arguments are interpreted as follows: if a given
      argument is numeric, the argument is passed as an int. If not, the pointer
      to the string value is passed. You are responsible to make sure a string
      is pre-extended long enough to receive any result that might be written
      into a string. You can't use a string literal (or other read-only string)
      as an argument to <span class="Li">&quot;syscall&quot;</span> because Perl
      has to assume that any string pointer might be written through. If your
      integer arguments are not literals and have never been interpreted in a
      numeric context, you may need to add <span class="Li">0</span> to them to
      force them to look like numbers. This emulates the
      <span class="Li">&quot;syswrite&quot;</span> function (or vice versa):
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    require 'syscall.ph';        # may need to run h2ph
    my $s = &quot;hi there\n&quot;;
    syscall(SYS_write(), fileno(STDOUT), $s, length $s);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that Perl supports passing of up to only 14 arguments to
        your syscall, which in practice should (usually) suffice.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Syscall returns whatever value returned by the system call it
        calls. If the system call fails,
        <span class="Li">&quot;syscall&quot;</span> returns
        <span class="Li">&quot;-1&quot;</span> and sets
        <span class="Li">$!</span> (errno). Note that some system calls
        <i>can</i> legitimately return <span class="Li">&quot;-1&quot;</span>.
        The proper way to handle such calls is to assign
        <span class="Li">&quot;$! = 0&quot;</span> before the call, then check
        the value of <span class="Li">$!</span> if
        <span class="Li">&quot;syscall&quot;</span> returns
        <span class="Li">&quot;-1&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There's a problem with
        <span class="Li">&quot;syscall(SYS_pipe())&quot;</span>: it returns the
        file number of the read end of the pipe it creates, but there is no way
        to retrieve the file number of the other end. You can avoid this problem
        by using <span class="Li">&quot;pipe&quot;</span> instead.</p>

    FILEHANDLE,FILENAME,MODE,PERMS</a></dt>
  <dd>Opens the file whose filename is given by FILENAME, and associates it with
      FILEHANDLE. If FILEHANDLE is an expression, its value is used as the real
      filehandle wanted; an undefined scalar will be suitably autovivified. This
      function calls the underlying operating system's <b>open</b>(2) function
      with the parameters FILENAME, MODE, and PERMS.
    <p class="Pp">Returns true on success and
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> otherwise.</p>
    <p class="Pp">PerlIO layers will be applied to the handle the same way they
        would in an <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> call that does not
        specify layers. That is, the current value of
        <span class="Li">&quot;${^OPEN}&quot;</span> as set by the open pragma
        in a lexical scope, or the <span class="Li">&quot;-C&quot;</span>
        commandline option or <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot;</span>
        environment variable in the main program scope, falling back to the
        platform defaults as described in &quot;Defaults and how to override
        them&quot; in PerlIO. If you want to remove any layers that may
        transform the byte stream, use
        <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span> after opening it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The possible values and flag bits of the MODE parameter are
        system-dependent; they are available via the standard module
        <span class="Li">&quot;Fcntl&quot;</span>. See the documentation of your
        operating system's <b>open</b>(2) syscall to see which values and flag
        bits are available. You may combine several flags using the
        <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>-operator.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Some of the most common values are
        <span class="Li">&quot;O_RDONLY&quot;</span> for opening the file in
        read-only mode, <span class="Li">&quot;O_WRONLY&quot;</span> for opening
        the file in write-only mode, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;O_RDWR&quot;</span> for opening the file in
        read-write mode.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For historical reasons, some values work on almost every
        system supported by Perl: 0 means read-only, 1 means write-only, and 2
        means read/write. We know that these values do <i>not</i> work under
        OS/390 and on the Macintosh; you probably don't want to use them in new
        code.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the file named by FILENAME does not exist and the
        <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> call creates it (typically
        because MODE includes the <span class="Li">&quot;O_CREAT&quot;</span>
        flag), then the value of PERMS specifies the permissions of the newly
        created file. If you omit the PERMS argument to
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span>, Perl uses the octal value
        <span class="Li">0666</span>. These permission values need to be in
        octal, and are modified by your process's current
        <span class="Li">&quot;umask&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In many systems the <span class="Li">&quot;O_EXCL&quot;</span>
        flag is available for opening files in exclusive mode. This is
        <b>not</b> locking: exclusiveness means here that if the file already
        exists, <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span> fails.
        <span class="Li">&quot;O_EXCL&quot;</span> may not work on network
        filesystems, and has no effect unless the
        <span class="Li">&quot;O_CREAT&quot;</span> flag is set as well. Setting
        <span class="Li">&quot;O_CREAT|O_EXCL&quot;</span> prevents the file
        from being opened if it is a symbolic link. It does not protect against
        symbolic links in the file's path.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Sometimes you may want to truncate an already-existing file.
        This can be done using the <span class="Li">&quot;O_TRUNC&quot;</span>
        flag. The behavior of <span class="Li">&quot;O_TRUNC&quot;</span> with
        <span class="Li">&quot;O_RDONLY&quot;</span> is undefined.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You should seldom if ever use <span class="Li">0644</span> as
        argument to <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span>, because that
        takes away the user's option to have a more permissive umask. Better to
        omit it. See <span class="Li">&quot;umask&quot;</span> for more on
      this.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This function has no direct relation to the usage of
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysread&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;syswrite&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysseek&quot;</span>. A handle opened with this
        function can be used with buffered IO just as one opened with
        <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> can be used with unbuffered
      IO.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that under Perls older than 5.8.0,
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysopen&quot;</span> depends on the
        <b>fdopen</b>(3) C library function. On many Unix systems,
        <b>fdopen</b>(3) is known to fail when file descriptors exceed a certain
        value, typically 255. If you need more file descriptors than that,
        consider using the <span class="Li">&quot;POSIX::open&quot;</span>
        function. For Perls 5.8.0 and later, PerlIO is (most often) the
      default.</p>

      Returns the number of bytes actually read, <span class="Li">0</span> at
      end of file, or undef if there was an error (in the latter case
      <span class="Li">$!</span> is also set). SCALAR will be grown or shrunk so
      that the last byte actually read is the last byte of the scalar after the
      read.
    <p class="Pp">An OFFSET may be specified to place the read data at some
        place in the string other than the beginning. A negative OFFSET
        specifies placement at that many characters counting backwards from the

        results in the string being padded to the required size with

    <p class="Pp">There is no <b>syseof()</b> function, which is ok, since

      FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value gives the name of the

      new position to POSITION; <span class="Li">1</span> to set it to the
      current position plus POSITION; and <span class="Li">2</span> to set it to
      EOF plus POSITION, typically negative.
    <p class="Pp">Note the emphasis on bytes: even if the filehandle has been

        <span class="Li">&quot;sysseek&quot;</span> family of functions use byte
        offsets, not character offsets, because seeking to a character offset
        would be very slow in a UTF-8 file.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;sysseek&quot;</span> bypasses normal
        buffered IO, so mixing it with reads other than
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysread&quot;</span> (for example

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Fcntl 'SEEK_CUR';
    sub systell { sysseek($_[0], 0, SEEK_CUR) }

        true&quot;</span>; thus <span class="Li">&quot;sysseek&quot;</span>
        returns true on success and false on failure, yet you can still easily

  <dd>Does exactly the same thing as <span class="Li">&quot;exec&quot;</span>,
      except that a fork is done first and the parent process waits for the
      child process to exit. Note that argument processing varies depending on
      the number of arguments. If there is more than one argument in LIST, or if
      LIST is an array with more than one value, starts the program given by the
      first element of the list with arguments given by the rest of the list. If
      there is only one scalar argument, the argument is checked for shell
      metacharacters, and if there are any, the entire argument is passed to the
      system's command shell for parsing (this is <span class="Li">&quot;/bin/sh
      -c&quot;</span> on Unix platforms, but varies on other platforms). If
      there are no shell metacharacters in the argument, it is split into words

    <p class="Pp">Perl will attempt to flush all files opened for output before

        described in &quot;`STRING`&quot; in perlop. Return value of -1
        indicates a failure to start the program or an error of the

    <p class="Pp">Since <span class="Li">&quot;SIGINT&quot;</span> and

        attempt to write characters with code points over 255, raises an
        exception. See <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span>, and the open pragma.</p>

  <dt>tell FILEHANDLE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="tell"><a class="permalink" href="#tell">tell</a></dt>
  <dd>Returns the current position <i>in bytes</i> for FILEHANDLE, or -1 on
      error. FILEHANDLE may be an expression whose value gives the name of the
      actual filehandle. If FILEHANDLE is omitted, assumes the file last read.
    <p class="Pp">Note the emphasis on bytes: even if the filehandle has been
        set to operate on characters (for example using the
        <span class="Li">&quot;:encoding(UTF-8)&quot;</span> I/O layer), the
        <span class="Li">&quot;seek&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysseek&quot;</span> family of functions use byte
        offsets, not character offsets, because seeking to a character offset
        would be very slow in a UTF-8 file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The return value of <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span>
        for the standard streams like the STDIN depends on the operating system:
        it may return -1 or something else.
        <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span> on pipes, fifos, and sockets
        usually returns -1.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There is no <span class="Li">&quot;systell&quot;</span>
        function. Use <span class="Li">&quot;sysseek($fh, 0, 1)&quot;</span> for
        that.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Do not use <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span> (or other
        buffered I/O operations) on a filehandle that has been manipulated by
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysread&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;syswrite&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;sysseek&quot;</span>. Those functions ignore the
        buffering, while <span class="Li">&quot;tell&quot;</span> does not.</p>

    VARIABLE,CLASSNAME,LIST</a></dt>
  <dd>This function binds a variable to a package class that will provide the
      implementation for the variable. VARIABLE is the name of the variable to
      be enchanted. CLASSNAME is the name of a class implementing objects of
      correct type. Any additional arguments are passed to the appropriate
      constructor method of the class (meaning
      <span class="Li">&quot;TIESCALAR&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;TIEHANDLE&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;TIEARRAY&quot;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;TIEHASH&quot;</span>). Typically these are
      arguments such as might be passed to the <b>dbm_open</b>(3) function of C.
      The object returned by the constructor is also returned by the
      <span class="Li">&quot;tie&quot;</span> function, which would be useful if
      you want to access other methods in CLASSNAME.
    <p class="Pp">Note that functions such as

        create a file with permissions <span class="Li">0777</span>, if your
        umask is <span class="Li">0022</span>, then the file will actually be
        created with permissions <span class="Li">0755</span>. If your

        <span class="Li">0027</span> (group can't write; others can't read,
        write, or execute), then passing

        would create a file with mode <span class="Li">0640</span> (because
        <span class="Li">&quot;0666 &amp;~ 027&quot;</span> is
        <span class="Li">0640</span>).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here's some advice: supply a creation mode of
        <span class="Li">0666</span> for regular files (in

        <span class="Li">0777</span> for directories (in
        <span class="Li">&quot;mkdir&quot;</span>) and executable files. This
        gives users the freedom of choice: if they want protected files, they
        might choose process umasks of <span class="Li">022</span>,
        <span class="Li">027</span>, or even the particularly antisocial mask of
        <span class="Li">077</span>. Programs should rarely if ever make policy
        decisions better left to the user. The exception to this is when writing

  <dd>Undefines the value of EXPR, which must be an lvalue. Use only on a scalar

    <p class="Pp">If EXPR is omitted, unpacks the <span class="Li">$_</span>
        string. See perlpacktut for an introduction to this function.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The string is broken into chunks described by the TEMPLATE.
        Each chunk is converted separately to a value. Typically, either the

    <p class="Pp">The TEMPLATE has the same format as in the

    <p class="Pp">In addition to fields allowed in

        %&lt;number&gt; to indicate that you want a &lt;number&gt;-bit checksum
        of the items instead of the items themselves. Default is a 16-bit
        checksum. The checksum is calculated by summing numeric values of
        expanded values (for string fields the sum of
        <span class="Li">&quot;ord($char)&quot;</span> is taken; for bit fields
        the sum of zeroes and ones).</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example, the following computes the same number as the

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    my $setbits = unpack(&quot;%32b*&quot;, $selectmask);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;p&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;P&quot;</span> formats should be used with care.
        Since Perl has no way of checking whether the value passed to
        <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span> corresponds to a valid memory
        location, passing a pointer value that's not known to be valid is likely
        to have disastrous consequences.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If there are more pack codes or if the repeat count of a field
        or a group is larger than what the remainder of the input string allows,
        the result is not well defined: the repeat count may be decreased, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span> may produce empty strings or
        zeros, or it may raise an exception. If the input string is longer than
        one described by the TEMPLATE, the remainder of that input string is

  <dd>Imports some semantics into the current package from the named module,
      generally by aliasing certain subroutine or variable names into your
      package. It is exactly equivalent to
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    BEGIN { require Module; Module-&gt;import( LIST ); }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">except that Module <i>must</i> be a bareword. The importation
        can be made conditional by using the if module.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In the <span class="Li">&quot;use VERSION&quot;</span> form,
        VERSION may be either a v-string such as v5.24.1, which will be compared
        to <span class="Li">$^V</span> (aka
        <span class="Li">$PERL_VERSION</span>), or a numeric argument of the
        form 5.024001, which will be compared to <span class="Li">$]</span>. An
        exception is raised if VERSION is greater than the version of the
        current Perl interpreter; Perl will not attempt to parse the rest of the
        file. Compare with <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>, which
        can do a similar check at run time. Symmetrically,
        <span class="Li">&quot;no VERSION&quot;</span> allows you to specify
        that you want a version of Perl older than the specified one.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Specifying VERSION as a numeric argument of the form 5.024001
        should generally be avoided as older less readable syntax compared to
        v5.24.1. Before perl 5.8.0 released in 2002 the more verbose numeric
        form was the only supported syntax, which is why you might see it in</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use v5.24.1;    # compile time version check
    use 5.24.1;     # ditto
    use 5.024_001;  # ditto; older syntax compatible with perl 5.6
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This is often useful if you need to check the current Perl
        version before <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>ing library
        modules that won't work with older versions of Perl. (We try not to do
        this more than we have to.)</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;use VERSION&quot;</span> also lexically
        enables all features available in the requested version as defined by
        the feature pragma, disabling any features not in the requested
        version's feature bundle. See feature. Similarly, if the specified Perl
        version is greater than or equal to 5.12.0, strictures are enabled
        lexically as with <span class="Li">&quot;use strict&quot;</span>. Any
        explicit use of <span class="Li">&quot;use strict&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;no strict&quot;</span> overrides
        <span class="Li">&quot;use VERSION&quot;</span>, even if it comes before
        it. Later use of <span class="Li">&quot;use VERSION&quot;</span> will
        override all behavior of a previous <span class="Li">&quot;use
        VERSION&quot;</span>, possibly removing the
        <span class="Li">&quot;strict&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;feature&quot;</span> added by
        <span class="Li">&quot;use VERSION&quot;</span>.
        <span class="Li">&quot;use VERSION&quot;</span> does not load the
        <i>feature.pm</i> or <i>strict.pm</i> files.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span> forces the
        <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> to happen at compile time.
        The <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> makes sure the module is
        loaded into memory if it hasn't been yet. The
        <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> is not a builtin; it's just
        an ordinary static method call into the
        <span class="Li">&quot;Module&quot;</span> package to tell the module to
        import the list of features back into the current package. The module
        can implement its <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> method any
        way it likes, though most modules just choose to derive their
        <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> method via inheritance from
        the <span class="Li">&quot;Exporter&quot;</span> class that is defined
        in the <span class="Li">&quot;Exporter&quot;</span> module. See
        Exporter. If no <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> method can be
        found, then the call is skipped, even if there is an AUTOLOAD
      method.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you do not want to call the package's
        <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> method (for instance, to stop
        your namespace from being altered), explicitly supply the empty
      list:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Module ();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">That is exactly equivalent to</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    BEGIN { require Module }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the VERSION argument is present between Module and LIST,
        then the <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> will call the
        <span class="Li">&quot;VERSION&quot;</span> method in class Module with
        the given version as an argument:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use Module 12.34;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is equivalent to:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    BEGIN { require Module; Module-&gt;VERSION(12.34) }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The default <span class="Li">&quot;VERSION&quot;</span>
        method, inherited from the <span class="Li">&quot;UNIVERSAL&quot;</span>
        class, croaks if the given version is larger than the value of the
        variable <span class="Li">$Module::VERSION</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The VERSION argument cannot be an arbitrary expression. It
        only counts as a VERSION argument if it is a version number literal,
        starting with either a digit or <span class="Li">&quot;v&quot;</span>
        followed by a digit. Anything that doesn't look like a version literal
        will be parsed as the start of the LIST. Nevertheless, many attempts to
        use an arbitrary expression as a VERSION argument will appear to work,
        because Exporter's <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> method
        handles numeric arguments specially, performing version checks rather
        than treating them as things to export.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Again, there is a distinction between omitting LIST
        (<span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> called with no arguments)
        and an explicit empty LIST <span class="Li">&quot;()&quot;</span>
        (<span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> not called). Note that there
        is no comma after VERSION!</p>
    <p class="Pp">Because this is a wide-open interface, pragmas (compiler
        directives) are also implemented this way. Some of the currently
        implemented pragmas are:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use constant;
    use diagnostics;
    use integer;
    use sigtrap  qw(SEGV BUS);
    use strict   qw(subs vars refs);
    use subs     qw(afunc blurfl);
    use warnings qw(all);
    use sort     qw(stable);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Some of these pseudo-modules import semantics into the current
        block scope (like <span class="Li">&quot;strict&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;integer&quot;</span>, unlike ordinary modules,
        which import symbols into the current package (which are effective
        through the end of the file).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Because <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> takes effect
        at compile time, it doesn't respect the ordinary flow control of the
        code being compiled. In particular, putting a
        <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> inside the false branch of a
        conditional doesn't prevent it from being processed. If a module or
        pragma only needs to be loaded conditionally, this can be done using the
        if pragma:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use if $] &lt; 5.008, &quot;utf8&quot;;
    use if WANT_WARNINGS, warnings =&gt; qw(all);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">There's a corresponding <span class="Li">&quot;no&quot;</span>
        declaration that unimports meanings imported by
        <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>, i.e., it calls
        <span class="Li">&quot;Module-&gt;unimport(LIST)&quot;</span> instead of
        <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span>. It behaves just as
        <span class="Li">&quot;import&quot;</span> does with VERSION, an omitted
        or empty LIST, or no unimport method being found.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    no integer;
    no strict 'refs';
    no warnings;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Care should be taken when using the <span class="Li">&quot;no
        VERSION&quot;</span> form of <span class="Li">&quot;no&quot;</span>. It
        is <i>only</i> meant to be used to assert that the running Perl is of a
        earlier version than its argument and <i>not</i> to undo the
        feature-enabling side effects of <span class="Li">&quot;use
        VERSION&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See perlmodlib for a list of standard modules and pragmas. See
        perlrun for the <span class="Li">&quot;-M&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;-m&quot;</span> command-line options to Perl that
        give <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> functionality from the
        command-line.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="utime"><a class="permalink" href="#utime">utime LIST</a></dt>
  <dd>Changes the access and modification times on each file of a list of files.
      The first two elements of the list must be the NUMERIC access and
      modification times, in that order. Returns the number of files
      successfully changed. The inode change time of each file is set to the
      current time. For example, this code has the same effect as the Unix
      <b>touch</b>(1) command when the files <i>already exist</i> and belong to
      the user running the program:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    #!/usr/bin/perl
    my $atime = my $mtime = time;
    utime $atime, $mtime, @ARGV;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Since Perl 5.8.0, if the first two elements of the list are
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>, the <b>utime</b>(2) syscall
        from your C library is called with a null second argument. On most
        systems, this will set the file's access and modification times to the
        current time (i.e., equivalent to the example above) and will work even
        on files you don't own provided you have write permission:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    for my $file (@ARGV) {
        utime(undef, undef, $file)
            || warn &quot;Couldn't touch $file: $!&quot;;
    }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Under NFS this will use the time of the NFS server, not the
        time of the local machine. If there is a time synchronization problem,
        the NFS server and local machine will have different times. The Unix
        <b>touch</b>(1) command will in fact normally use this form instead of
        the one shown in the first example.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Passing only one of the first two elements as
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> is equivalent to passing a 0
        and will not have the effect described when both are
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>. This also triggers an
        uninitialized warning.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On systems that support <b>futimes</b>(2), you may pass
        filehandles among the files. On systems that don't support
        <b>futimes</b>(2), passing filehandles raises an exception. Filehandles
        must be passed as globs or glob references to be recognized; barewords
        are considered filenames.</p>

  <dt id="values"><a class="permalink" href="#values">values HASH</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="values~2"><a class="permalink" href="#values~2">values ARRAY</a></dt>
  <dd>In list context, returns a list consisting of all the values of the named
      hash. In Perl 5.12 or later only, will also return a list of the values of
      an array; prior to that release, attempting to use an array argument will
      produce a syntax error. In scalar context, returns the number of values.
    <p class="Pp">Hash entries are returned in an apparently random order. The
        actual random order is specific to a given hash; the exact same series
        of operations on two hashes may result in a different order for each
        hash. Any insertion into the hash may change the order, as will any
        deletion, with the exception that the most recent key returned by
        <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span> may be deleted without changing
        the order. So long as a given hash is unmodified you may rely on
        <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;values&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span> to repeatedly return the same
        order as each other. See &quot;Algorithmic Complexity Attacks&quot; in
        perlsec for details on why hash order is randomized. Aside from the
        guarantees provided here the exact details of Perl's hash algorithm and
        the hash traversal order are subject to change in any release of Perl.
        Tied hashes may behave differently to Perl's hashes with respect to
        changes in order on insertion and deletion of items.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As a side effect, calling
        <span class="Li">&quot;values&quot;</span> resets the HASH or ARRAY's
        internal iterator (see <span class="Li">&quot;each&quot;</span>) before
        yielding the values. In particular, calling
        <span class="Li">&quot;values&quot;</span> in void context resets the
        iterator with no other overhead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Apart from resetting the iterator,
        <span class="Li">&quot;values @array&quot;</span> in list context is the
        same as plain <span class="Li">@array</span>. (We recommend that you use
        void context <span class="Li">&quot;keys @array&quot;</span> for this,
        but reasoned that taking <span class="Li">&quot;values
        @array&quot;</span> out would require more documentation than leaving it
        in.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the values are not copied, which means modifying
        them will modify the contents of the hash:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    for (values %hash)      { s/foo/bar/g }  # modifies %hash values
    for (@hash{keys %hash}) { s/foo/bar/g }  # same
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Starting with Perl 5.14, an experimental feature allowed
        <span class="Li">&quot;values&quot;</span> to take a scalar expression.
        This experiment has been deemed unsuccessful, and was removed as of Perl
        5.24.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To avoid confusing would-be users of your code who are running
        earlier versions of Perl with mysterious syntax errors, put this sort of
        thing at the top of your file to signal that your code will work
        <i>only</i> on Perls of a recent vintage:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use 5.012;  # so keys/values/each work on arrays

    <p class="Pp">See also <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span>,

  </dd>
  <dt id="vec"><a class="permalink" href="#vec">vec EXPR,OFFSET,BITS</a></dt>
  <dd>Treats the string in EXPR as a bit vector made up of elements of width
      BITS and returns the value of the element specified by OFFSET as an
      unsigned integer. BITS therefore specifies the number of bits that are
      reserved for each element in the bit vector. This must be a power of two
      from 1 to 32 (or 64, if your platform supports that).
    <p class="Pp">If BITS is 8, &quot;elements&quot; coincide with bytes of the
        input string.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If BITS is 16 or more, bytes of the input string are grouped
        into chunks of size BITS/8, and each group is converted to a number as
        with
        <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;unpack&quot;</span>
        with big-endian formats
        <span class="Li">&quot;n&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;N&quot;</span>
        (and analogously for BITS==64). See
        <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span> for details.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If bits is 4 or less, the string is broken into bytes, then
        the bits of each byte are broken into 8/BITS groups. Bits of a byte are
        numbered in a little-endian-ish way, as in <span class="Li">0x01</span>,
        <span class="Li">0x02</span>, <span class="Li">0x04</span>,
        <span class="Li">0x08</span>, <span class="Li">0x10</span>,
        <span class="Li">0x20</span>, <span class="Li">0x40</span>,
        <span class="Li">0x80</span>. For example, breaking the single input
        byte <span class="Li">&quot;chr(0x36)&quot;</span> into two groups gives
        a list <span class="Li">&quot;(0x6, 0x3)&quot;</span>; breaking it into
        4 groups gives <span class="Li">&quot;(0x2, 0x1, 0x3,
      0x0)&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;vec&quot;</span> may also be assigned
        to, in which case parentheses are needed to give the expression the
        correct precedence as in</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    vec($image, $max_x * $x + $y, 8) = 3;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the selected element is outside the string, the value 0 is
        returned. If an element off the end of the string is written to, Perl
        will first extend the string with sufficiently many zero bytes. It is an
        error to try to write off the beginning of the string (i.e., negative
        OFFSET).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the string happens to be encoded as UTF-8 internally (and
        thus has the UTF8 flag set), <span class="Li">&quot;vec&quot;</span>
        tries to convert it to use a one-byte-per-character internal
        representation. However, if the string contains characters with values
        of 256 or higher, a fatal error will occur.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Strings created with <span class="Li">&quot;vec&quot;</span>
        can also be manipulated with the logical operators
        <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;~&quot;</span>. These operators will assume a bit
        vector operation is desired when both operands are strings. See
        &quot;Bitwise String Operators&quot; in perlop.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The following code will build up an ASCII string saying
        <span class="Li">'PerlPerlPerl'</span>. The comments show the string

  <dt id="wait"><a class="permalink" href="#wait">wait</a></dt>
  <dd>Behaves like <b>wait</b>(2) on your system: it waits for a child process
      to terminate and returns the pid of the deceased process, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;-1&quot;</span> if there are no child processes.
      The status is returned in <span class="Li">$?</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}&quot;</span>. Note that a
      return value of <span class="Li">&quot;-1&quot;</span> could mean that
      child processes are being automatically reaped, as described in perlipc.
    <p class="Pp">If you use <span class="Li">&quot;wait&quot;</span> in your
        handler for <span class="Li">$SIG{CHLD}</span>, it may accidentally wait
        for the child created by <span class="Li">&quot;qx&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span>. See perlipc for details.</p>

  <dt id="waitpid"><a class="permalink" href="#waitpid">waitpid
    PID,FLAGS</a></dt>
  <dd>Waits for a particular child process to terminate and returns the pid of
      the deceased process, or <span class="Li">&quot;-1&quot;</span> if there
      is no such child process. A non-blocking wait (with WNOHANG in FLAGS) can
      return 0 if there are child processes matching PID but none have
      terminated yet. The status is returned in <span class="Li">$?</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;${^CHILD_ERROR_NATIVE}&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">A PID of <span class="Li">0</span> indicates to wait for any
        child process whose process group ID is equal to that of the current
        process. A PID of less than <span class="Li">&quot;-1&quot;</span>
        indicates to wait for any child process whose process group ID is equal
        to -PID. A PID of <span class="Li">&quot;-1&quot;</span> indicates to
        wait for any child process.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you say</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    use POSIX &quot;:sys_wait_h&quot;;
    my $kid;

        $kid = waitpid(-1, WNOHANG);

    <pre>    1 while waitpid(-1, WNOHANG) &gt; 0;

    <p class="Pp">then you can do a non-blocking wait for all pending zombie
        processes (see &quot;WAIT&quot; in POSIX). Non-blocking wait is
        available on machines supporting either the <b>waitpid</b>(2) or
        <b>wait4</b>(2) syscalls. However, waiting for a particular pid with
        FLAGS of <span class="Li">0</span> is implemented everywhere. (Perl
        emulates the system call by remembering the status values of processes
        that have exited but have not been harvested by the Perl script
      yet.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that on some systems, a return value of
        <span class="Li">&quot;-1&quot;</span> could mean that child processes

  </dd>
  <dt id="warn"><a class="permalink" href="#warn">warn LIST</a></dt>
  <dd>Emits a warning, usually by printing it to
      <span class="Li">&quot;STDERR&quot;</span>.
      <span class="Li">&quot;warn&quot;</span> interprets its operand LIST in
      the same way as <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>, but is slightly
      different in what it defaults to when LIST is empty or makes an empty
      string. If it is empty and <span class="Li">$@</span> already contains an
      exception value then that value is used after appending
      <span class="Li">&quot;\t...caught&quot;</span>. If it is empty and
      <span class="Li">$@</span> is also empty then the string
      <span class="Li">&quot;Warning: Something's</span>
      <span class="Li">wrong&quot;</span> is used.
    <p class="Pp">By default, the exception derived from the operand LIST is
        stringified and printed to <span class="Li">&quot;STDERR&quot;</span>.
        This behaviour can be altered by installing a
        <span class="Li">$SIG{__WARN__}</span> handler. If there is such a
        handler then no message is automatically printed; it is the handler's
        responsibility to deal with the exception as it sees fit (like, for
        instance, converting it into a <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>).
        Most handlers must therefore arrange to actually display the warnings
        that they are not prepared to deal with, by calling
        <span class="Li">&quot;warn&quot;</span> again in the handler. Note that
        this is quite safe and will not produce an endless loop, since
        <span class="Li">&quot;__WARN__&quot;</span> hooks are not called from
        inside one.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You will find this behavior is slightly different from that of
        <span class="Li">$SIG{__DIE__}</span> handlers (which don't suppress the
        error text, but can instead call <span class="Li">&quot;die&quot;</span>
        again to change it).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Using a <span class="Li">&quot;__WARN__&quot;</span> handler
        provides a powerful way to silence all warnings (even the so-called
        mandatory ones). An example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    # wipe out *all* compile-time warnings
    BEGIN { $SIG{'__WARN__'} = sub { warn $_[0] if $DOWARN } }
    my $foo = 10;
    my $foo = 20;          # no warning about duplicate my $foo,
                           # but hey, you asked for it!
    # no compile-time or run-time warnings before here
    $DOWARN = 1;
    # run-time warnings enabled after here
    warn &quot;\$foo is alive and $foo!&quot;;     # does show up
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">See perlvar for details on setting
        <span class="Li">%SIG</span> entries and for more examples. See the Carp
        module for other kinds of warnings using its
        <span class="Li">&quot;carp&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;cluck&quot;</span> functions.</p>

  <dt>write FILEHANDLE</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>write EXPR</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="write"><a class="permalink" href="#write">write</a></dt>
  <dd>Writes a formatted record (possibly multi-line) to the specified
      FILEHANDLE, using the format associated with that file. By default the
      format for a file is the one having the same name as the filehandle, but
      the format for the current output channel (see the
      <span class="Li">&quot;select&quot;</span> function) may be set explicitly
      by assigning the name of the format to the <span class="Li">$~</span>
      variable.
    <p class="Pp">Top of form processing is handled automatically: if there is
        insufficient room on the current page for the formatted record, the page
        is advanced by writing a form feed and a special top-of-page format is
        used to format the new page header before the record is written. By
        default, the top-of-page format is the name of the filehandle with
        <span class="Li">&quot;_TOP&quot;</span> appended, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;top&quot;</span> in the current package if the
        former does not exist. This would be a problem with autovivified
        filehandles, but it may be dynamically set to the format of your choice
        by assigning the name to the <span class="Li">$^</span> variable while
        that filehandle is selected. The number of lines remaining on the
        current page is in variable <span class="Li">&quot;$-&quot;</span>,
        which can be set to <span class="Li">0</span> to force a new page.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If FILEHANDLE is unspecified, output goes to the current
        default output channel, which starts out as STDOUT but may be changed by
        the <span class="Li">&quot;select&quot;</span> operator. If the
        FILEHANDLE is an EXPR, then the expression is evaluated and the
        resulting string is used to look up the name of the FILEHANDLE at run
        time. For more on formats, see perlform.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that write is <i>not</i> the opposite of
        <span class="Li">&quot;read&quot;</span>. Unfortunately.</p>
