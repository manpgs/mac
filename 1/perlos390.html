  and utilities for Perl on OS/390</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Be sure that your yacc installation is in place including any
    necessary parser template files. If you have not already done so then be
    sure to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  cp /samples/yyparse.c /etc
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This may also be a good time to ensure that your /etc/protocol
    file and either your /etc/resolv.conf or /etc/hosts files are in place. The
    IBM document that described such USS system setup issues was SC28-1890-07
    &quot;OS/390 UNIX System Services Planning&quot;, in particular Chapter 6 on
    customizing the OE shell.</p>
<p class="Pp">GNU make for OS/390, which is recommended for the build of perl
    (as well as building CPAN modules and extensions), is available from the
    &quot;Tools&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some people have reported encountering &quot;Out of memory!&quot;
    errors while trying to build Perl using GNU make binaries. If you encounter
    such trouble then try to download the source code kit and build GNU make
    from source to eliminate any such trouble. You might also find GNU make (as
    well as Perl and Apache) in the red-piece/book &quot;Open Source Software
    for OS/390 UNIX&quot;, SG24-5944-00 from IBM.</p>
<p class="Pp">If instead of the recommended GNU make you would like to use the
    system supplied make program then be sure to install the default rules file
    properly via the shell command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    cp /samples/startup.mk /etc
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and be sure to also set the environment variable _C89_CCMODE=1
    (exporting _C89_CCMODE=1 is also a good idea for users of GNU make).</p>
<p class="Pp">You might also want to have GNU groff for OS/390 installed before
    running the &quot;make install&quot; step for Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is a syntax error in the /usr/include/sys/socket.h header
    file that IBM supplies with USS V2R7, V2R8, and possibly V2R9. The problem
    with the header file is that near the definition of the SO_REUSEPORT
    constant there is a spurious extra '/' character outside of a comment like
    so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
 #define SO_REUSEPORT    0x0200    /* allow local address &amp; port
                                      reuse */                    /
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You could edit that header yourself to remove that last '/', or
    you might note that Language Environment (LE) APAR PQ39997 describes the
    problem and PTF's UQ46272 and UQ46271 are the (R8 at least) fixes and apply
    them. If left unattended that syntax error will turn up as an inability for
    Perl to build its &quot;Socket&quot; extension.</p>
<p class="Pp">For successful testing you may need to turn on the sticky bit for
    your world readable /tmp directory if you have not already done so (see man
    chmod).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Configure_Perl_on_"><a class="permalink" href="#Configure_Perl_on_">Configure
  Perl on OS/390</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Once you've unpacked the distribution, run &quot;sh
    Configure&quot; (see INSTALL for a full discussion of the Configure
    options). There is a &quot;hints&quot; file for os390 that specifies the
    correct values for most things. Some things to watch out for include:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>A message of the form:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
 (I see you are using the Korn shell.  Some ksh's blow up on
 Configure, mainly on older exotic systems.  If yours does, try the
 Bourne shell instead.)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is nothing to worry about at all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Some of the parser default template files in /samples are needed in /etc.
      In particular be sure that you at least copy /samples/yyparse.c to /etc
      before running Perl's Configure. This step ensures successful extraction
      of EBCDIC versions of parser files such as perly.c and perly.h. This has
      to be done before running Configure the first time. If you failed to do so
      then the easiest way to re-Configure Perl is to delete your misconfigured
      build root and re-extract the source from the tar ball. Then you must
      ensure that /etc/yyparse.c is properly in place before attempting to
      re-run Configure.</li>
  <li>This port will support dynamic loading, but it is not selected by default.
      If you would like to experiment with dynamic loading then be sure to
      specify -Dusedl in the arguments to the Configure script. See the comments
      in hints/os390.sh for more information on dynamic loading. If you build
      with dynamic loading then you will need to add the
      <span class="Li">$archlibexp</span>/CORE directory to your LIBPATH
      environment variable in order for perl to work. See the config.sh file for
      the value of <span class="Li">$archlibexp</span>. If in trying to use Perl
      you see an error message similar to:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
 CEE3501S The module libperl.dll was not found.
   From entry point __dllstaticinit at compile unit offset +00000194
   at
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">then your LIBPATH does not have the location of libperl.x and
        either libperl.dll or libperl.so in it. Add that directory to your
        LIBPATH and proceed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Do not turn on the compiler optimization flag &quot;-O&quot;. There is a
      bug in either the optimizer or perl that causes perl to not work correctly
      when the optimizer is on.</li>
  <li>Some of the configuration files in /etc used by the networking APIs are
      either missing or have the wrong names. In particular, make sure that
      there's either an /etc/resolv.conf or an /etc/hosts, so that
      <b>gethostbyname()</b> works, and make sure that the file /etc/proto has
      been renamed to /etc/protocol (NOT /etc/protocols, as used by other Unix
      systems). You may have to look for things like HOSTNAME and DOMAINORIGIN
      in the &quot;//'SYS1.TCPPARMS(TCPDATA)'&quot; PDS member in order to
      properly set up your /etc networking files.</li>

  Anomalies with Perl on OS/390</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">&quot;Out of memory!&quot; messages during the build of Perl are
    most often fixed by re building the GNU make utility for OS/390 from a
    source code kit.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another memory limiting item to check is your MAXASSIZE parameter
    in your 'SYS1.PARMLIB(BPXPRMxx)' data set (note too that as of V2R8 address
    space limits can be set on a per user ID basis in the USS segment of a RACF
    profile). People have reported successful builds of Perl with MAXASSIZE
    parameters as small as 503316480 (and it may be possible to build Perl with
    a MAXASSIZE smaller than that).</p>
<p class="Pp">Within USS your /etc/profile or
    <span class="Li">$HOME</span>/.profile may limit your ulimit settings. Check
    that the following command returns reasonable values:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    ulimit -a
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To conserve memory you should have your compiler modules loaded
    into the Link Pack Area (LPA/ELPA) rather than in a link list or step
  lib.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the c89 compiler complains of syntax errors during the build of
    the Socket extension then be sure to fix the syntax error in the system
    header /usr/include/sys/socket.h.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Testing_Anomalies_with_Perl_on_"><a class="permalink" href="#Testing_Anomalies_with_Perl_on_">Testing
  Anomalies with Perl on OS/390</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;make test&quot; step runs a Perl Verification Procedure,
    usually before installation. You might encounter STDERR messages even during
    a successful run of &quot;make test&quot;. Here is a guide to some of the
    more commonly seen anomalies:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>A message of the form:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
 io/openpid...........CEE5210S The signal SIGHUP was received.
 CEE5210S The signal SIGHUP was received.
 CEE5210S The signal SIGHUP was received.
 ok
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">indicates that the t/io/openpid.t test of Perl has passed but
        done so with extraneous messages on stderr from CEE.</p>
  </li>
  <li>A message of the form:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
 lib/ftmp-security....File::Temp::_gettemp: Parent directory (/tmp/)
 is not safe (sticky bit not set when world writable?) at
 lib/ftmp-security.t line 100
 File::Temp::_gettemp: Parent directory (/tmp/) is not safe (sticky
 bit not set when world writable?) at lib/ftmp-security.t line 100
 ok
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">indicates a problem with the permissions on your /tmp
        directory within the HFS. To correct that problem issue the command:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
     chmod a+t /tmp
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">from an account with write access to the directory entry for
        /tmp.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Out of Memory!
    <p class="Pp">Recent perl test suite is quite memory hungry. In addition to
        the comments above on memory limitations it is also worth checking for
        _CEE_RUNOPTS in your environment. Perl now has (in miniperlmain.c) a C
        #pragma to set CEE run options, but the environment variable wins.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The C code asks for:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
 #pragma runopts(HEAP(2M,500K,ANYWHERE,KEEP,8K,4K) STACK(,,ANY,) ALL31(ON))
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The important parts of that are the second argument (the
        increment) to HEAP, and allowing the stack to be &quot;Above the (16M)
        line&quot;. If the heap increment is too small then when perl (for
        example loading unicode/Name.pl) tries to create a &quot;big&quot;
        (400K+) string it cannot fit in a single segment and you get &quot;Out
        of Memory!&quot; - even if there is still plenty of memory
      available.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A related issue is use with perl's malloc. Perl's malloc uses
        <span class="Li">&quot;sbrk()&quot;</span> to get memory, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;sbrk()&quot;</span> is limited to the first
        allocation so in this case something like:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  HEAP(8M,500K,ANYWHERE,KEEP,8K,4K)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is needed to get through the test suite.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

  Hints for Perl on OS/390</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When using perl on OS/390 please keep in mind that the EBCDIC and
    ASCII character sets are different. See perlebcdic.pod for more on such
    character set issues. Perl builtin functions that may behave differently
    under EBCDIC are also mentioned in the perlport.pod document.</p>
<p class="Pp">Open Edition (UNIX System Services) from V2R8 onward does support
    #!/path/to/perl script invocation. There is a PTF available from IBM for
    V2R7 that will allow shell/kernel support for #!. USS releases prior to V2R7
    did not support the #! means of script invocation. If you are running V2R6
    or earlier then see:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    head `whence perldoc`
</pre>
<p class="Pp">for an example of how to use the &quot;eval exec&quot; trick to
    ask the shell to have Perl run your scripts on those older releases of Unix
    System Services.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are having trouble with square brackets then consider
    switching your rlogin or telnet client. Try to avoid older 3270 emulators
    and ISHELL for working with Perl on USS.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Floating_Point_Anomalies_with_Perl_on_"><a class="permalink" href="#Floating_Point_Anomalies_with_Perl_on_">Floating
  Point Anomalies with Perl on OS/390</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There appears to be a bug in the floating point implementation on
    S/390 systems such that calling <b>int()</b> on the product of a number and
    a small magnitude number is not the same as calling <b>int()</b> on the
    quotient of that number and a large magnitude number. For example, in the
    following Perl code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    my $x = 100000.0;
    my $y = int($x * 1e-5) * 1e5; # '0'
    my $z = int($x / 1e+5) * 1e5;  # '100000'
    print &quot;\$y is $y and \$z is $z\n&quot;; # $y is 0 and $z is 100000
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Although one would expect the quantities
    <span class="Li">$y</span> and <span class="Li">$z</span> to be the same and
    equal to 100000 they will differ and instead will be 0 and 100000
    respectively.</p>
<p class="Pp">The problem can be further examined in a roughly equivalent C
    program:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    #include &lt;math.h&gt;
    main()
    {
    double r1,r2;
    double x = 100000.0;
    double y = 0.0;
    double z = 0.0;
    x = 100000.0 * 1e-5;
    r1 = modf (x,&amp;y);
    x = 100000.0 / 1e+5;
    r2 = modf (x,&amp;z);
    printf(&quot;y is %e and z is %e\n&quot;,y*1e5,z*1e5);
    /* y is 0.000000e+00 and z is 1.000000e+05 (with c89) */

<h2 class="Ss" id="Modules_and_Extensions_for_Perl_on_"><a class="permalink" href="#Modules_and_Extensions_for_Perl_on_">Modules
  and Extensions for Perl on OS/390</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Pure pure (that is non xs) modules may be installed via the
  usual:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you built perl with dynamic loading capability then that would
    also be the way to build xs based extensions. However, if you built perl
    with the default static linking you can still build xs based extensions for
    OS/390 but you will need to follow the instructions in ExtUtils::MakeMaker
    for building statically linked perl binaries. In the simplest configurations
    building a static perl + xs extension boils down to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make perl
    make test
    make install
    make -f Makefile.aperl inst_perl MAP_TARGET=perl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In most cases people have reported better results with GNU make
    rather than the system's /bin/make program, whether for plain modules or for
    xs based extensions.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the make process encounters trouble with either compilation or
    linking then try setting the _C89_CCMODE to 1. Assuming sh is your login
    shell then run:</p>
