<p class="Pp">In 5.22.0 perl started setting umask to

    wrongfully tells <span class="Li">open(2)</span> to strip the owner read and

    negation of leaving only those bits in place.</p>
<p class="Pp">Systems that use mode <span class="Li">0666</span> in

    &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues/15015&gt;</li>
  <li>In some cases, failing to parse a here-doc would attempt to use freed

  <li>If a here-doc was found while parsing another operator, the parser had

      produce an assertion or a segmentation fault. This now reliably complains
      about the unterminated here-doc. [GH #14789]

  <li>Certain regex patterns involving a complemented posix class in an inverted

      argument in-place rather than returning a modified copy. The criteria for
      this optimization has been made stricter to avoid these functions
      accidentally modifying in-place when they should not, which has been
      happening in some cases, e.g. in List::Util.</li>
  <li>Excessive memory usage in the compilation of some regular expressions
      involving non-ASCII characters has been reduced. A more complete fix is
