<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This document describes the layout of the Perl source tree. If
    you're hacking on the Perl core, this will help you find what you're looking
    for.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="FINDING_YOUR_WAY_AROUND"><a class="permalink" href="#FINDING_YOUR_WAY_AROUND">FINDING
  YOUR WAY AROUND</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The Perl source tree is big. Here's some of the thing you'll find
    in it:</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="C_code"><a class="permalink" href="#C_code">C code</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The C source code and header files mostly live in the root of the
    source tree. There are a few platform-specific directories which contain C
    code. In addition, some of the modules shipped with Perl include C or XS
    code.</p>
<p class="Pp">See perlinterp for more details on the files that make up the Perl
    interpreter, as well as details on how it works.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Core_modules"><a class="permalink" href="#Core_modules">Core
  modules</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Modules shipped as part of the Perl core live in four
    subdirectories. Two of these directories contain modules that live in the
    core, and two contain modules that can also be released separately on CPAN.
    Modules which can be released on cpan are known as &quot;dual-life&quot;
    modules.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><i>lib/</i>
    <p class="Pp">This directory contains pure-Perl modules which are only
        released as part of the core. This directory contains <i>all</i> of the
        modules and their tests, unlike other core modules.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>ext/</i>
    <p class="Pp">Like <i>lib/</i>, this directory contains modules which are
        only released as part of the core. Unlike <i>lib/</i>, however, a module
        under <i>ext/</i> generally has a CPAN-style directory- and file-layout
        and its own <i>Makefile.PL</i>. There is no expectation that a module
        under <i>ext/</i> will work with earlier versions of Perl 5. Hence, such
        a module may take full advantage of syntactical and other improvements
        in Perl 5 blead.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>dist/</i>
    <p class="Pp">This directory is for dual-life modules where the blead source
        is canonical. Note that some modules in this directory may not yet have
        been released separately on CPAN. Modules under <i>dist/</i> should make
        an effort to work with earlier versions of Perl 5.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>cpan/</i>
    <p class="Pp">This directory contains dual-life modules where the CPAN
        module is canonical. Do not patch these modules directly! Changes to
        these modules should be submitted to the maintainer of the CPAN module.
        Once those changes are applied and released, the new version of the
        module will be incorporated into the core.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">For some dual-life modules, it has not yet been determined if the
    CPAN version or the blead source is canonical. Until that is done, those
    modules should be in <i>cpan/</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Tests"><a class="permalink" href="#Tests">Tests</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Perl core has an extensive test suite. If you add new tests
    (or new modules with tests), you may need to update the <i>t/TEST</i> file
    so that the tests are run.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Module tests
    <p class="Pp">Tests for core modules in the <i>lib/</i> directory are right
        next to the module itself. For example, we have <i>lib/strict.pm</i> and
        <i>lib/strict.t</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Tests for modules in <i>ext/</i> and the dual-life modules are
        in <i>t/</i> subdirectories for each module, like a standard CPAN
        distribution.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>t/base/</i>
    <p class="Pp">Tests for the absolute basic functionality of Perl. This
        includes <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span>, basic file reads and
        writes, simple regexes, etc. These are run first in the test suite and
        if any of them fail, something is <i>really</i> broken.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>t/cmd/</i>
    <p class="Pp">Tests for basic control structures,
        <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;else&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span>, subroutines, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>t/comp/</i>
    <p class="Pp">Tests for basic issues of how Perl parses and compiles
      itself.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>t/io/</i>
    <p class="Pp">Tests for built-in IO functions, including command line
        arguments.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>t/mro/</i>
    <p class="Pp">Tests for perl's method resolution order implementations (see
        mro).</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>t/op/</i>
    <p class="Pp">Tests for perl's built in functions that don't fit into any of
        the other directories.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>t/opbasic/</i>
    <p class="Pp">Tests for perl's built in functions which, like those in
        <i>t/op/</i>, do not fit into any of the other directories, but which,
        in addition, cannot use <i>t/test.pl</i>,as that program depends on
        functionality which the test file itself is testing.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>t/re/</i>
    <p class="Pp">Tests for regex related functions or behaviour. (These used to
        live in t/op).</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>t/run/</i>
    <p class="Pp">Tests for features of how perl actually runs, including exit
        codes and handling of PERL* environment variables.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>t/uni/</i>
    <p class="Pp">Tests for the core support of Unicode.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>t/win32/</i>
    <p class="Pp">Windows-specific tests.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>t/porting/</i>
    <p class="Pp">Tests the state of the source tree for various common errors.
        For example, it tests that everyone who is listed in the git log has a
        corresponding entry in the <i>AUTHORS</i> file.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>t/lib/</i>
    <p class="Pp">The old home for the module tests, you shouldn't put anything
        new in here. There are still some bits and pieces hanging around in here
        that need to be moved. Perhaps you could move them? Thanks!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Documentation"><a class="permalink" href="#Documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">All of the core documentation intended for end users lives in
    <i>pod/</i>. Individual modules in <i>lib/</i>, <i>ext/</i>, <i>dist/</i>,
    and <i>cpan/</i> usually have their own documentation, either in the
    <i>Module.pm</i> file or an accompanying <i>Module.pod</i> file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, documentation intended for core Perl developers lives in
    the <i>Porting/</i> directory.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Hacking_tools_and_documentation"><a class="permalink" href="#Hacking_tools_and_documentation">Hacking
  tools and documentation</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <i>Porting</i> directory contains a grab bag of code and
    documentation intended to help porters work on Perl. Some of the highlights
    include:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><i>check*</i>
    <p class="Pp">These are scripts which will check the source things like ANSI
        C violations, POD encoding issues, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>Maintainers</i>, <i>Maintainers.pl</i>, and <i>Maintainers.pm</i>
    <p class="Pp">These files contain information on who maintains which
        modules. Run <span class="Li">&quot;perl Porting/Maintainers -M
        Module::Name&quot;</span> to find out more information about a dual-life
        module.</p>
  </li>
  <li><i>podtidy</i>
    <p class="Pp">Tidies a pod file. It's a good idea to run this on a pod file
        you've patched.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Build_system"><a class="permalink" href="#Build_system">Build
  system</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Perl build system starts with the <i>Configure</i> script in
    the root directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">Platform-specific pieces of the build system also live in
    platform-specific directories like <i>win32/</i>, <i>vms/</i>, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>Configure</i> script is ultimately responsible for
    generating a <i>Makefile</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The build system that Perl uses is called metaconfig. This system
    is maintained separately from the Perl core.</p>
<p class="Pp">The metaconfig system has its own git repository. Please see its
    README file in &lt;https://github.com/Perl/metaconfig&gt; for more
  details.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>Cross</i> directory contains various files related to
    cross-compiling Perl. See <i>Cross/README</i> for more details.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss"><i>AUTHORS</i></h2>
<p class="Pp">This file lists everyone who's contributed to Perl. If you submit
    a patch, you should add your name to this file as part of the patch.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss"><i>MANIFEST</i></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <i>MANIFEST</i> file in the root of the source tree contains a
    list of every file in the Perl core, as well as a brief description of each
    file.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can get an overview of all the files with this command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
