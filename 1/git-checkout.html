<p class="Pp">Updates files in the working tree to match the version in the
    index or the specified tree. If no pathspec was given, <i>git checkout</i>
    will also update <b>HEAD</b> to set the specified branch as the current
    branch.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>git checkout</i> [&lt;branch&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">To prepare for working on <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>, switch
  to it by updating the index and the files in the working tree, and by pointing
  <b>HEAD</b> at the branch. Local modifications to the files in the working
  tree are kept, so that they can be committed to the <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>.
<p class="Pp">If <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> is not found but there does exist a
    tracking branch in exactly one remote (call it <b>&lt;remote&gt;</b>) with a
    matching name and <b>--no-guess</b> is not specified, treat as equivalent
  to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt; --track &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">You could omit <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>, in which case the command
    degenerates to &quot;check out the current branch&quot;, which is a
    glorified no-op with rather expensive side-effects to show only the tracking
    information, if exists, for the current branch.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>git checkout</i> -b|-B &lt;new-branch&gt;
  [&lt;start-point&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifying <b>-b</b> causes a new branch to be created as
  if <b>git-branch</b>(1) were called and then checked out. In this case you can
  use the <b>--track</b> or <b>--no-track</b> options, which will be passed to
  <i>git branch</i>. As a convenience, <b>--track</b> without <b>-b</b> implies
  branch creation; see the description of <b>--track</b> below.
<p class="Pp">If <b>-B</b> is given, <b>&lt;new-branch&gt;</b> is created if it
    doesn&#x2019;t exist; otherwise, it is reset. This is the transactional
    equivalent of</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git branch -f &lt;branch&gt; [&lt;start-point&gt;]
$ git checkout &lt;branch&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">that is to say, the branch is not reset/created unless &quot;git
    checkout&quot; is successful.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>git checkout</i> --detach [&lt;branch&gt;], <i>git checkout</i>
    [--detach] &lt;commit&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prepare to work on top of <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>, by
  detaching <b>HEAD</b> at it (see &quot;DETACHED HEAD&quot; section), and
  updating the index and the files in the working tree. Local modifications to
  the files in the working tree are kept, so that the resulting working tree
  will be the state recorded in the commit plus the local modifications.
<p class="Pp">When the <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> argument is a branch name, the
    <b>--detach</b> option can be used to detach <b>HEAD</b> at the tip of the
    branch (<b>git checkout &lt;branch&gt;</b> would check out that branch
    without detaching <b>HEAD</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Omitting <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> detaches <b>HEAD</b> at the tip of
    the current branch.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>git checkout</i>
    [-f|--ours|--theirs|-m|--conflict=&lt;style&gt;] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--]
    &lt;pathspec&gt;..., <i>git checkout</i>
    [-f|--ours|--theirs|-m|--conflict=&lt;style&gt;] [&lt;tree-ish&gt;]
    --pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt; [--pathspec-file-nul]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Overwrite the contents of the files that match the
  pathspec. When the <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</b> (most often a commit) is not given,
  overwrite working tree with the contents in the index. When the
  <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</b> is given, overwrite both the index and the working
  tree with the contents at the <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</b>.
<p class="Pp">The index may contain unmerged entries because of a previous
    failed merge. By default, if you try to check out such an entry from the
    index, the checkout operation will fail and nothing will be checked out.
    Using <b>-f</b> will ignore these unmerged entries. The contents from a
    specific side of the merge can be checked out of the index by using
    <b>--ours</b> or <b>--theirs</b>. With <b>-m</b>, changes made to the
    working tree file can be discarded to re-create the original conflicted
    merge result.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>git checkout</i> (-p|--patch) [&lt;tree-ish&gt;] [--]
    [&lt;pathspec&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is similar to the previous mode, but lets you use
  the interactive interface to show the &quot;diff&quot; output and choose which
  hunks to use in the result. See below for the description of <b>--patch</b>
  option.</div>

<section class="Sh">

<p class="Pp">-q, --quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Quiet, suppress feedback messages.</div>
<p class="Pp">--progress, --no-progress</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Progress status is reported on the standard error stream
  by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless <b>--quiet</b> is
  specified. This flag enables progress reporting even if not attached to a
  terminal, regardless of <b>--quiet</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-f, --force</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When switching branches, proceed even if the index or the
  working tree differs from <b>HEAD</b>, and even if there are untracked files
  in the way. This is used to throw away local changes and any untracked files
  or directories that are in the way.
<p class="Pp">When checking out paths from the index, do not fail upon unmerged
    entries; instead, unmerged entries are ignored.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--ours, --theirs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When checking out paths from the index, check out stage
  #2 (<i>ours</i>) or #3 (<i>theirs</i>) for unmerged paths.
<p class="Pp">Note that during <b>git rebase</b> and <b>git pull --rebase</b>,
    <i>ours</i> and <i>theirs</i> may appear swapped; <b>--ours</b> gives the
    version from the branch the changes are rebased onto, while <b>--theirs</b>
    gives the version from the branch that holds your work that is being
    rebased.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is because <b>rebase</b> is used in a workflow that treats
    the history at the remote as the shared canonical one, and treats the work
    done on the branch you are rebasing as the third-party work to be
    integrated, and you are temporarily assuming the role of the keeper of the
    canonical history during the rebase. As the keeper of the canonical history,
    you need to view the history from the remote as <b>ours</b> (i.e. &quot;our
    shared canonical history&quot;), while what you did on your side branch as
    <b>theirs</b> (i.e. &quot;one contributor&#x2019;s work on top of
  it&quot;).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-b &lt;new-branch&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Create a new branch named <b>&lt;new-branch&gt;</b> and
  start it at <b>&lt;start-point&gt;</b>; see <b>git-branch</b>(1) for
  details.</div>
<p class="Pp">-B &lt;new-branch&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Creates the branch <b>&lt;new-branch&gt;</b> and start it
  at <b>&lt;start-point&gt;</b>; if it already exists, then reset it to
  <b>&lt;start-point&gt;</b>. This is equivalent to running &quot;git
  branch&quot; with &quot;-f&quot;; see <b>git-branch</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">-t, --track[=(direct|inherit)]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When creating a new branch, set up &quot;upstream&quot;
  configuration. See &quot;--track&quot; in <b>git-branch</b>(1) for details.
<p class="Pp">If no <b>-b</b> option is given, the name of the new branch will
    be derived from the remote-tracking branch, by looking at the local part of
    the refspec configured for the corresponding remote, and then stripping the
    initial part up to the &quot;*&quot;. This would tell us to use <b>hack</b>
    as the local branch when branching off of <b>origin/hack</b> (or
    <b>remotes/origin/hack</b>, or even <b>refs/remotes/origin/hack</b>). If the
    given name has no slash, or the above guessing results in an empty name, the
    guessing is aborted. You can explicitly give a name with <b>-b</b> in such a
    case.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-track</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not set up &quot;upstream&quot; configuration, even if
  the <b>branch.autoSetupMerge</b> configuration variable is true.</div>
<p class="Pp">--guess, --no-guess</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> is not found but there does
  exist a tracking branch in exactly one remote (call it <b>&lt;remote&gt;</b>)
  with a matching name, treat as equivalent to
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git checkout -b &lt;branch&gt; --track &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the branch exists in multiple remotes and one of them is named
    by the <b>checkout.defaultRemote</b> configuration variable, we&#x2019;ll
    use that one for the purposes of disambiguation, even if the
    <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> isn&#x2019;t unique across all remotes. Set it to e.g.
    <b>checkout.defaultRemote=origin</b> to always checkout remote branches from
    there if <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> is ambiguous but exists on the <i>origin</i>
    remote. See also <b>checkout.defaultRemote</b> in <b>git-config</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--guess</b> is the default behavior. Use <b>--no-guess</b> to
    disable it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The default behavior can be set via the <b>checkout.guess</b>
    configuration variable.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-l</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Create the new branch&#x2019;s reflog; see
  <b>git-branch</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">-d, --detach</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Rather than checking out a branch to work on it, check
  out a commit for inspection and discardable experiments. This is the default
  behavior of <b>git checkout &lt;commit&gt;</b> when <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> is
  not a branch name. See the &quot;DETACHED HEAD&quot; section below for
  details.</div>
<p class="Pp">--orphan &lt;new-branch&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Create a new <i>orphan</i> branch, named
  <b>&lt;new-branch&gt;</b>, started from <b>&lt;start-point&gt;</b> and switch
  to it. The first commit made on this new branch will have no parents and it
  will be the root of a new history totally disconnected from all the other
  branches and commits.
<p class="Pp">The index and the working tree are adjusted as if you had
    previously run <b>git checkout &lt;start-point&gt;</b>. This allows you to
    start a new history that records a set of paths similar to
    <b>&lt;start-point&gt;</b> by easily running <b>git commit -a</b> to make
    the root commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">This can be useful when you want to publish the tree from a commit
    without exposing its full history. You might want to do this to publish an
    open source branch of a project whose current tree is &quot;clean&quot;, but
    whose full history contains proprietary or otherwise encumbered bits of
    code.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to start a disconnected history that records a set of
    paths that is totally different from the one of <b>&lt;start-point&gt;</b>,
    then you should clear the index and the working tree right after creating
    the orphan branch by running <b>git rm -rf .</b> from the top level of the
    working tree. Afterwards you will be ready to prepare your new files,
    repopulating the working tree, by copying them from elsewhere, extracting a
    tarball, etc.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-skip-worktree-bits</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In sparse checkout mode, <b>git checkout --
  &lt;paths&gt;</b> would update only entries matched by <b>&lt;paths&gt;</b>
  and sparse patterns in <b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</b>. This option
  ignores the sparse patterns and adds back any files in
  <b>&lt;paths&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-m, --merge</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When switching branches, if you have local modifications
  to one or more files that are different between the current branch and the
  branch to which you are switching, the command refuses to switch branches in
  order to preserve your modifications in context. However, with this option, a
  three-way merge between the current branch, your working tree contents, and
  the new branch is done, and you will be on the new branch.
<p class="Pp">When a merge conflict happens, the index entries for conflicting
    paths are left unmerged, and you need to resolve the conflicts and mark the
    resolved paths with <b>git add</b> (or <b>git rm</b> if the merge should
    result in deletion of the path).</p>
<p class="Pp">When checking out paths from the index, this option lets you
    recreate the conflicted merge in the specified paths.</p>
<p class="Pp">When switching branches with <b>--merge</b>, staged changes may be
    lost.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--conflict=&lt;style&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The same as <b>--merge</b> option above, but changes the
  way the conflicting hunks are presented, overriding the
  <b>merge.conflictStyle</b> configuration variable. Possible values are
  &quot;merge&quot; (default), &quot;diff3&quot;, and &quot;zdiff3&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">-p, --patch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Interactively select hunks in the difference between the
  <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</b> (or the index, if unspecified) and the working tree.
  The chosen hunks are then applied in reverse to the working tree (and if a
  <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</b> was specified, the index).
<p class="Pp">This means that you can use <b>git checkout -p</b> to selectively
    discard edits from your current working tree. See the &#x201C;Interactive
    Mode&#x201D; section of <b>git-add</b>(1) to learn how to operate the
    <b>--patch</b> mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that this option uses the no overlay mode by default (see
    also <b>--overlay</b>), and currently doesn&#x2019;t support overlay
  mode.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-other-worktrees</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>git checkout</b> refuses when the wanted ref is
  already checked out by another worktree. This option makes it check the ref
  out anyway. In other words, the ref can be held by more than one
  worktree.</div>
<p class="Pp">--overwrite-ignore, --no-overwrite-ignore</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Silently overwrite ignored files when switching branches.
  This is the default behavior. Use <b>--no-overwrite-ignore</b> to abort the
  operation when the new branch contains ignored files.</div>
<p class="Pp">--recurse-submodules, --no-recurse-submodules</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Using <b>--recurse-submodules</b> will update the content
  of all active submodules according to the commit recorded in the superproject.
  If local modifications in a submodule would be overwritten the checkout will
  fail unless <b>-f</b> is used. If nothing (or <b>--no-recurse-submodules</b>)
  is used, submodules working trees will not be updated. Just like
  <b>git-submodule</b>(1), this will detach <b>HEAD</b> of the submodule.</div>
<p class="Pp">--overlay, --no-overlay</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In the default overlay mode, <b>git checkout</b> never
  removes files from the index or the working tree. When specifying
  <b>--no-overlay</b>, files that appear in the index and working tree, but not
  in <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</b> are removed, to make them match
  <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</b> exactly.</div>
<p class="Pp">--pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pathspec is passed in <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> instead of
  commandline args. If <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> is exactly <b>-</b> then standard
  input is used. Pathspec elements are separated by LF or CR/LF. Pathspec
  elements can be quoted as explained for the configuration variable
  <b>core.quotePath</b> (see <b>git-config</b>(1)). See also
  <b>--pathspec-file-nul</b> and global <b>--literal-pathspecs</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--pathspec-file-nul</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only meaningful with <b>--pathspec-from-file</b>.
  Pathspec elements are separated with NUL character and all other characters
  are taken literally (including newlines and quotes).</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;branch&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Branch to checkout; if it refers to a branch (i.e., a
  name that, when prepended with &quot;refs/heads/&quot;, is a valid ref), then
  that branch is checked out. Otherwise, if it refers to a valid commit, your
  <b>HEAD</b> becomes &quot;detached&quot; and you are no longer on any branch
  (see below for details).
<p class="Pp">You can use the <b>@{-N}</b> syntax to refer to the N-th last
    branch/commit checked out using &quot;git checkout&quot; operation. You may
    also specify <b>-</b> which is synonymous to <b>@{-1}</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a special case, you may use <b>A...B</b> as a shortcut for the
    merge base of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> if there is exactly one merge base. You
    can leave out at most one of <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, in which case it
    defaults to <b>HEAD</b>.</p>

<p class="Pp">&lt;new-branch&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Name for the new branch.</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;start-point&gt;</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DETACHED_HEAD"><a class="permalink" href="#DETACHED_HEAD">DETACHED
  HEAD</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>HEAD</b> normally refers to a named branch (e.g.
    <b>master</b>). Meanwhile, each branch refers to a specific commit.
    Let&#x2019;s look at a repo with three commits, one of them tagged, and with
    branch <b>master</b> checked out:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
           HEAD (refers to branch 'master')
            |
            v
a---b---c  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'c')
    ^
    |
  tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">When a commit is created in this state, the branch is updated to
    refer to the new commit. Specifically, <i>git commit</i> creates a new
    commit <b>d</b>, whose parent is commit <b>c</b>, and then updates branch
    <b>master</b> to refer to new commit <b>d</b>. <b>HEAD</b> still refers to
    branch <b>master</b> and so indirectly now refers to commit <b>d</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ edit; git add; git commit
               HEAD (refers to branch 'master')
                |
                v
a---b---c---d  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd')
    ^
    |
  tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">It is sometimes useful to be able to checkout a commit that is not
    at the tip of any named branch, or even to create a new commit that is not
    referenced by a named branch. Let&#x2019;s look at what happens when we
    checkout commit <b>b</b> (here we show two ways this may be done):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git checkout v2.0  # or
$ git checkout master^^
   HEAD (refers to commit 'b')
    |
    v
a---b---c---d  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd')
    ^
    |
  tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Notice that regardless of which checkout command we use,
    <b>HEAD</b> now refers directly to commit <b>b</b>. This is known as being
    in detached <b>HEAD</b> state. It means simply that <b>HEAD</b> refers to a
    specific commit, as opposed to referring to a named branch. Let&#x2019;s see
    what happens when we create a commit:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ edit; git add; git commit
     HEAD (refers to commit 'e')
      |
      v
      e
     /
a---b---c---d  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd')
    ^
    |
  tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">There is now a new commit <b>e</b>, but it is referenced only by
    <b>HEAD</b>. We can of course add yet another commit in this state:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ edit; git add; git commit
         HEAD (refers to commit 'f')
          |
          v
      e---f
     /
a---b---c---d  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd')
    ^
    |
  tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">In fact, we can perform all the normal Git operations. But,
    let&#x2019;s look at what happens when we then checkout <b>master</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git checkout master
               HEAD (refers to branch 'master')
      e---f     |
     /          v
a---b---c---d  branch 'master' (refers to commit 'd')

  tag 'v2.0' (refers to commit 'b')
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">It is important to realize that at this point nothing refers to
    commit <b>f</b>. Eventually commit <b>f</b> (and by extension commit
    <b>e</b>) will be deleted by the routine Git garbage collection process,
    unless we create a reference before that happens. If we have not yet moved
    away from commit <b>f</b>, any of these will create a reference to it:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git checkout -b foo   <b>(1)</b>
$ git branch foo        <b>(2)</b>
$ git tag foo           <b>(3)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>1. </b>creates a new branch <b>foo</b>, which refers to commit
    <b>f</b>, and then updates <b>HEAD</b> to refer to branch <b>foo</b>. In
    other words, we&#x2019;ll no longer be in detached <b>HEAD</b> state after
    this command.
  <br/>
  <b>2. </b>similarly creates a new branch <b>foo</b>, which refers to commit
    <b>f</b>, but leaves <b>HEAD</b> detached.
  <br/>
  <b>3. </b>creates a new tag <b>foo</b>, which refers to commit <b>f</b>,
    leaving <b>HEAD</b> detached.</p>
<p class="Pp">If we have moved away from commit <b>f</b>, then we must first
    recover its object name (typically by using git reflog), and then we can
    create a reference to it. For example, to see the last two commits to which
    <b>HEAD</b> referred, we can use either of these commands:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git reflog -2 HEAD # or
$ git log -g -2 HEAD
</pre>
</div>

  DISAMBIGUATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When there is only one argument given and it is not <b>--</b>
    (e.g. <b>git checkout abc</b>), and when the argument is both a valid
    <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</b> (e.g. a branch <b>abc</b> exists) and a valid
    <b>&lt;pathspec&gt;</b> (e.g. a file or a directory whose name is
    &quot;abc&quot; exists), Git would usually ask you to disambiguate. Because
    checking out a branch is so common an operation, however, <b>git checkout
    abc</b> takes &quot;abc&quot; as a <b>&lt;tree-ish&gt;</b> in such a
    situation. Use <b>git checkout -- &lt;pathspec&gt;</b> if you want to
    checkout these paths out of the index.</p>

<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.The following sequence checks out the <b>master</b>
  branch, reverts the <b>Makefile</b> to two revisions back, deletes
  <b>hello.c</b> by mistake, and gets it back from the index.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git checkout master             <b>(1)</b>
$ git checkout master~2 Makefile  <b>(2)</b>
$ rm -f hello.c

  <br/>
  <b>2. </b>take a file out of another commit

  <b>3. </b>restore <b>hello.c</b> from the index</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to check out <i>all</i> C source files out of the
    index, you can say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git checkout -- '*.c'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note the quotes around <b>*.c</b>. The file <b>hello.c</b> will
    also be checked out, even though it is no longer in the working tree,
    because the file globbing is used to match entries in the index (not in the
    working tree by the shell).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you have an unfortunate branch that is named <b>hello.c</b>,
    this step would be confused as an instruction to switch to that branch. You
    should instead write:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git checkout -- hello.c
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.After working in the wrong branch, switching to the
  correct branch would be done using:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git checkout mytopic
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">However, your &quot;wrong&quot; branch and correct <b>mytopic</b>
    branch may differ in files that you have modified locally, in which case the
    above checkout would fail like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git checkout mytopic
error: You have local changes to 'frotz'; not switching branches.
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">You can give the <b>-m</b> flag to the command, which would try a
    three-way merge:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git checkout -m mytopic
Auto-merging frotz
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">After this three-way merge, the local modifications are <i>not</i>
    registered in your index file, so <b>git diff</b> would show you what
    changes you made since the tip of the new branch.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.When a merge conflict happens during switching
  branches with the <b>-m</b> option, you would see something like this:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git checkout -m mytopic
Auto-merging frotz
ERROR: Merge conflict in frotz
fatal: merge program failed
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">At this point, <b>git diff</b> shows the changes cleanly merged as
    in the previous example, as well as the changes in the conflicted files.
    Edit and resolve the conflict and mark it resolved with <b>git add</b> as
    usual:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ edit frotz
$ git add frotz
</pre>
</div>
