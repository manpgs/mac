<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">netstat</code> command symbolically displays
    the contents of various network-related data structures. There are a number
    of output formats, depending on the options for the information presented.
    The first form of the command displays a list of active sockets for each
    protocol. The second form presents the contents of one of the other network
    data structures according to the option selected. Using the third form, with
    a <var class="Ar">wait</var> interval specified,
    <code class="Nm">netstat</code> will continuously display the information
    regarding packet traffic on the configured network interfaces. The fourth
    form displays statistics for the specified protocol or address family. If a
    <var class="Ar">wait</var> interval is specified, the protocol information
    over the last interval seconds will be displayed. The fifth form displays
    per-interface statistics for the specified protocol or address family. The
    sixth form displays <a class="Xr" href="../9/mbuf">mbuf(9)</a> statistics.
    The seventh form displays routing table for the specified address family.
    The eighth form displays routing statistics.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options have the following meaning:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="A"><a class="permalink" href="#A"><code class="Fl">-A</code></a></dt>
  <dd>With the default display, show the address of any protocol control blocks
      associated with sockets and the flow hash; used for debugging.</dd>
  <dt id="a"><a class="permalink" href="#a"><code class="Fl">-a</code></a></dt>
  <dd>With the default display, show the state of all sockets; normally sockets
      used by server processes are not shown. With the routing table display
      (option <code class="Fl">-r</code>, as described below), show
      protocol-cloned routes (routes generated by a
      <code class="Dv">RTF_PRCLONING</code> parent route); normally these routes
      are not shown.</dd>
  <dt id="B"><a class="permalink" href="#B"><code class="Fl">-B</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Show statistics about <a class="Xr" href="../4/bpf">bpf(4)</a> devices.
      This includes information like how many packets have been matched, dropped
      and received by the <code class="Nm">bpf</code> device, also information
      about current buffer sizes and device states. The option
      <code class="Fl">-I</code> show information only for the
      <code class="Nm">bpf</code> devices bound the specified interface.</dd>
  <dt id="b"><a class="permalink" href="#b"><code class="Fl">-b</code></a></dt>
  <dd>With the interface display (option <code class="Fl">-i</code>, as
      described below), show the number of bytes in and out.</dd>
  <dt id="c"><a class="permalink" href="#c"><code class="Fl">-c</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">queue</var></dt>
  <dd>With the queue statistics (option <code class="Fl">-q</code>, as described
      below), show only those for the specified
    <var class="Ar">queue</var>.</dd>
  <dt id="d"><a class="permalink" href="#d"><code class="Fl">-d</code></a></dt>
  <dd>With either interface display (option <code class="Fl">-i</code> or an
      interval, as described below), show the number of dropped packets.</dd>
  <dt id="f"><a class="permalink" href="#f"><code class="Fl">-f</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">address_family</var></dt>
  <dd>Limit statistics or address control block reports to those of the
      specified <var class="Ar">address family</var>. The following address
      families are recognized: <var class="Ar">inet</var>, for
      <code class="Dv">AF_INET</code>, <var class="Ar">inet6</var>, for
      <code class="Dv">AF_INET6</code>, <var class="Ar">unix</var>, for
      <code class="Dv">AF_UNIX</code> and <var class="Ar">vsock</var>, for
      <code class="Dv">AF_VSOCK</code>.</dd>
  <dt id="g"><a class="permalink" href="#g"><code class="Fl">-g</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Show information related to multicast (group address) membership. If the
      <code class="Fl">-s</code> option is also present, show extended interface
      group management statistics. If the <code class="Fl">-v</code> option is
      specified, show link-layer memberships; they are suppressed by default.
      Source lists for each group will also be printed. Specifiying
      <code class="Fl">-v</code> twice will print the control plane timers for
      each interface and the source list counters for each group. If the
      <code class="Fl">-i</code> is specified, only that interface will be
      shown. If the <code class="Fl">-f</code> is specified, only information
      for the address family will be displayed.</dd>
  <dt id="I"><a class="permalink" href="#I"><code class="Fl">-I</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">interface</var></dt>
  <dd>Show information about the specified interface; used with a
      <var class="Ar">wait</var> interval as described below. If the
      <code class="Fl">-s</code> option is present, show per-interface protocol
      statistics on the <var class="Ar">interface</var> for the specified
      <var class="Ar">address_family</var> or <var class="Ar">protocol</var>, or
      for all protocol families.</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><code class="Fl">-i</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Show the state of interfaces which have been auto-configured (interfaces
      statically configured into a system, but not located at boot time are not
      shown). If the <code class="Fl">-a</code> options is also present,
      multicast addresses currently in use are shown for each Ethernet interface
      and for each IP interface address. Multicast addresses are shown on
      separate lines following the interface address with which they are
      associated. If the <code class="Fl">-s</code> option is present, show
      per-interface statistics on all interfaces for the specified
      <var class="Ar">address_family</var> or <var class="Ar">protocol</var>, or
      for all protocol families.</dd>
  <dt id="L"><a class="permalink" href="#L"><code class="Fl">-L</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Show the size of the various listen queues. The first count shows the
      number of unaccepted connections. The second count shows the amount of
      unaccepted incomplete connections. The third count is the maximum number
      of queued connections.</dd>
  <dt id="l"><a class="permalink" href="#l"><code class="Fl">-l</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Print full IPv6 address.</dd>
  <dt id="m"><a class="permalink" href="#m"><code class="Fl">-m</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Show statistics recorded by the memory management routines (the network
      stack manages a private pool of memory buffers). More detailed information
      about the buffers, which includes their cache related statistics, can be
      obtained by using <code class="Fl">-mm</code> or
      <code class="Fl">-m</code> <code class="Fl">-m</code> option.</dd>
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><code class="Fl">-n</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Show network addresses as numbers (normally
      <code class="Nm">netstat</code> interprets addresses and attempts to
      display them symbolically). This option may be used with any of the
      display formats.</dd>
  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><code class="Fl">-p</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">protocol</var></dt>
  <dd>Show statistics about <var class="Ar">protocol</var>, which is either a
      well-known name for a protocol or an alias for it. Some protocol names and
      aliases are listed in the file <span class="Pa">/etc/protocols</span>. The
      special protocol name &#x201C;bdg&#x201D; is used to show bridging
      statistics. A null response typically means that there are no interesting
      numbers to report. The program will complain if
      <var class="Ar">protocol</var> is unknown or if there is no statistics
      routine for it.</dd>
  <dt id="q"><a class="permalink" href="#q"><code class="Fl">-q</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Show network interface send queue statistics. By default all queues are
      displayed, unless specified with <code class="Fl">-c</code>. This option
      requires specifying an interface with <code class="Fl">-I</code> option.
      More detailed information about the queues, which includes their queueing
      algorithm related statistics, can be obtained by using
      <code class="Fl">-qq</code> or <code class="Fl">-q</code>
      <code class="Fl">-q</code> option.</dd>
  <dt id="r"><a class="permalink" href="#r"><code class="Fl">-r</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Show the routing tables. Use with <code class="Fl">-a</code> to show
      protocol-cloned routes. When <code class="Fl">-s</code> is also present,
      show routing statistics instead. When <code class="Fl">-l</code> is also
      present, <code class="Nm">netstat</code> assumes more columns are there
      and the maximum transmission unit. More detailed information about the
      route metrics are displayed with <code class="Fl">-ll</code> for TCP round
      trip times <code class="Fl">-lll</code> for all metrics. Use the
      <code class="Fl">-z</code> flags to display only entries with non-zero RTT
      values. (&#x201C;mtu&#x201D;) are also displayed.</dd>
  <dt id="R"><a class="permalink" href="#R"><code class="Fl">-R</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Show reachability information. Use with <code class="Fl">-i</code> to show
      link-layer reachability information for a given interface.</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><code class="Fl">-s</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Show per-protocol statistics. If this option is repeated, counters with a
      value of zero are suppressed. For security reasons, root privileges are
      required to read TCP statistics and in the absence of such privileges all
      TCP counters will be reported as zero.</dd>
  <dt id="S"><a class="permalink" href="#S"><code class="Fl">-S</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Show interface link status and interface state information about the
      specified interface. This option requires specifying an interface with
      <code class="Fl">-I</code> option.</dd>
  <dt id="v"><a class="permalink" href="#v"><code class="Fl">-v</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Increase verbosity level.</dd>
  <dt id="W"><a class="permalink" href="#W"><code class="Fl">-W</code></a></dt>
  <dd>In certain displays, avoid truncating addresses even if this causes some
      fields to overflow.</dd>
  <dt id="w"><a class="permalink" href="#w"><code class="Fl">-w</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">wait</var></dt>
  <dd>Show network interface or protocol statistics at intervals of
      <var class="Ar">wait</var> seconds.</dd>
  <dt id="x"><a class="permalink" href="#x"><code class="Fl">-x</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Show extended link-layer reachability information in addition to that
      shown by the <code class="Fl">-R</code> flag.</dd>

<p class="Pp">The default display, for active sockets, shows the local and
    remote addresses, send and receive queue sizes (in bytes), protocol, and the
    internal state of the protocol. Address formats are of the form
    &#x201C;host.port&#x201D; or &#x201C;network.port&#x201D; if a socket's
    address specifies a network but no specific host address. If known, the host
    and network addresses are displayed symbolically according to the databases
    <span class="Pa">/etc/hosts</span> and
    <span class="Pa">/etc/networks</span>, respectively. If a symbolic name for
    an address is unknown, or if the <code class="Fl">-n</code> option is

<p class="Pp">Direct routes are created for each interface attached to the local
    host; the gateway field for such entries shows the address of the outgoing
    interface. The refcnt field gives the current number of active uses of the
    route. Connection oriented protocols normally hold on to a single route for
    the duration of a connection while connectionless protocols obtain a route
    while sending to the same destination. The use field provides a count of the
    number of packets sent using that route. The interface entry indicates the
    network interface utilized for the route. A route which is marked with the
    RTF_IFSCOPE flag is instantiated for the corresponding interface. A cloning
    route which is marked with the RTF_PROXY flag will not generate new routes
    that are associated with its interface scope.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <code class="Nm">netstat</code> is invoked with the
    <code class="Fl">-w</code> option and a <var class="Ar">wait</var> interval
    argument, it displays a running count of statistics related to network
    interfaces or protocols. An obsolete version of this option used a numeric
    parameter with no option, and is currently supported for backward
    compatibility. By default, this display summarizes information for all
    interfaces. Information for a specific interface may be displayed with the
    <code class="Fl">-I</code> option.</p>
