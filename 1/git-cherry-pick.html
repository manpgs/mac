<p class="Pp">Given one or more existing commits, apply the change each one
    introduces, recording a new commit for each. This requires your working tree
    to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).</p>
<p class="Pp">When it is not obvious how to apply a change, the following
    happens:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.The current branch and <b>HEAD</b> pointer stay at the
  last commit successfully made.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.The <b>CHERRY_PICK_HEAD</b> ref is set to point at the
  commit that introduced the change that is difficult to apply.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Paths in which the change applied cleanly are updated
  both in the index file and in your working tree.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.For conflicting paths, the index file records up to
  three versions, as described in the &quot;TRUE MERGE&quot; section of
  <b>git-merge</b>(1). The working tree files will include a description of the
  conflict bracketed by the usual conflict markers
  <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</b> and
  <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 5.No other modifications are made.</div>
<p class="Pp">See <b>git-merge</b>(1) for some hints on resolving such
    conflicts.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">&lt;commit&gt;...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commits to cherry-pick. For a more complete list of ways
  to spell commits, see <b>gitrevisions</b>(7). Sets of commits can be passed
  but no traversal is done by default, as if the <b>--no-walk</b> option was
  specified, see <b>git-rev-list</b>(1). Note that specifying a range will feed
  all &lt;commit&gt;... arguments to a single revision walk (see a later example
  that uses <i>maint master..next</i>).</div>
<p class="Pp">-e, --edit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">With this option, <i>git cherry-pick</i> will let you
  edit the commit message prior to committing.</div>
<p class="Pp">--cleanup=&lt;mode&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option determines how the commit message will be
  cleaned up before being passed on to the commit machinery. See
  <b>git-commit</b>(1) for more details. In particular, if the
  <i>&lt;mode&gt;</i> is given a value of <b>scissors</b>, scissors will be
  appended to <b>MERGE_MSG</b> before being passed on in the case of a
  conflict.</div>
<p class="Pp">-x</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When recording the commit, append a line that says
  &quot;(cherry picked from commit ...)&quot; to the original commit message in
  order to indicate which commit this change was cherry-picked from. This is
  done only for cherry picks without conflicts. Do not use this option if you
  are cherry-picking from your private branch because the information is useless
  to the recipient. If on the other hand you are cherry-picking between two
  publicly visible branches (e.g. backporting a fix to a maintenance branch for
  an older release from a development branch), adding this information can be
  useful.</div>
<p class="Pp">-r</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">It used to be that the command defaulted to do <b>-x</b>
  described above, and <b>-r</b> was to disable it. Now the default is not to do
  <b>-x</b> so this option is a no-op.</div>
<p class="Pp">-m &lt;parent-number&gt;, --mainline &lt;parent-number&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Usually you cannot cherry-pick a merge because you do not
  know which side of the merge should be considered the mainline. This option
  specifies the parent number (starting from 1) of the mainline and allows
  cherry-pick to replay the change relative to the specified parent.</div>
<p class="Pp">-n, --no-commit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Usually the command automatically creates a sequence of
  commits. This flag applies the changes necessary to cherry-pick each named
  commit to your working tree and the index, without making any commit. In
  addition, when this option is used, your index does not have to match the HEAD
  commit. The cherry-pick is done against the beginning state of your index.
<p class="Pp">This is useful when cherry-picking more than one commits' effect
    to your index in a row.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-s, --signoff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Add a <b>Signed-off-by</b> trailer at the end of the
  commit message. See the signoff option in <b>git-commit</b>(1) for more
  information.</div>
<p class="Pp">-S[&lt;keyid&gt;], --gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;], --no-gpg-sign</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">GPG-sign commits. The <b>keyid</b> argument is optional
  and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it must be stuck to the
  option without a space. <b>--no-gpg-sign</b> is useful to countermand both
  <b>commit.gpgSign</b> configuration variable, and earlier
  <b>--gpg-sign</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If the current HEAD is the same as the parent of the
  cherry-pick&#x2019;ed commit, then a fast forward to this commit will be
  performed.</div>
<p class="Pp">--allow-empty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, cherry-picking an empty commit will fail,
  indicating that an explicit invocation of <b>git commit --allow-empty</b> is
  required. This option overrides that behavior, allowing empty commits to be
  preserved automatically in a cherry-pick. Note that when &quot;--ff&quot; is
  in effect, empty commits that meet the &quot;fast-forward&quot; requirement
  will be kept even without this option. Note also, that use of this option only
  keeps commits that were initially empty (i.e. the commit recorded the same
  tree as its parent). Commits which are made empty due to a previous commit are
  dropped. To force the inclusion of those commits use
  <b>--keep-redundant-commits</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--allow-empty-message</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, cherry-picking a commit with an empty message
  will fail. This option overrides that behavior, allowing commits with empty
  messages to be cherry picked.</div>
<p class="Pp">--keep-redundant-commits</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If a commit being cherry picked duplicates a commit
  already in the current history, it will become empty. By default these
  redundant commits cause <b>cherry-pick</b> to stop so the user can examine the
  commit. This option overrides that behavior and creates an empty commit
  object. Implies <b>--allow-empty</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--strategy=&lt;strategy&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use the given merge strategy. Should only be used once.
  See the MERGE STRATEGIES section in <b>git-merge</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">-X&lt;option&gt;, --strategy-option=&lt;option&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pass the merge strategy-specific option through to the
  merge strategy. See <b>git-merge</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">--rerere-autoupdate, --no-rerere-autoupdate</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow the rerere mechanism to update the index with the
  result of auto-conflict resolution if possible.</div>

  SUBCOMMANDS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">--continue</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Continue the operation in progress using the information
  in <b>.git/sequencer</b>. Can be used to continue after resolving conflicts in
  a failed cherry-pick or revert.</div>
<p class="Pp">--skip</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Skip the current commit and continue with the rest of the
  sequence.</div>
<p class="Pp">--quit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Forget about the current operation in progress. Can be
  used to clear the sequencer state after a failed cherry-pick or revert.</div>
<p class="Pp">--abort</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Cancel the operation and return to the pre-sequence
  state.</div>

<p class="Pp"><b>git cherry-pick master</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Apply the change introduced by the commit at the tip of
  the master branch and create a new commit with this change.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git cherry-pick ..master</b>, <b>git cherry-pick ^HEAD
    master</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Apply the changes introduced by all commits that are
  ancestors of master but not of HEAD to produce new commits.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git cherry-pick maint next ^master</b>, <b>git cherry-pick
    maint master..next</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Apply the changes introduced by all commits that are
  ancestors of maint or next, but not master or any of its ancestors. Note that
  the latter does not mean <b>maint</b> and everything between <b>master</b> and
  <b>next</b>; specifically, <b>maint</b> will not be used if it is included in
  <b>master</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git cherry-pick master~4 master~2</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Apply the changes introduced by the fifth and third last
  commits pointed to by master and create 2 new commits with these
  changes.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git cherry-pick -n master~1 next</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Apply to the working tree and the index the changes
  introduced by the second last commit pointed to by master and by the last
  commit pointed to by next, but do not create any commit with these
  changes.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git cherry-pick --ff ..next</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If history is linear and HEAD is an ancestor of next,
  update the working tree and advance the HEAD pointer to match next. Otherwise,
  apply the changes introduced by those commits that are in next but not HEAD to
  the current branch, creating a new commit for each new change.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git rev-list --reverse master -- README | git cherry-pick -n
    --stdin</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Apply the changes introduced by all commits on the master
  branch that touched README to the working tree and index, so the result can be
  inspected and made into a single new commit if suitable.</div>
<p class="Pp">The following sequence attempts to backport a patch, bails out
    because the code the patch applies to has changed too much, and then tries
    again, this time exercising more care about matching up context lines.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git cherry-pick topic^             <b>(1)</b>
$ git diff                           <b>(2)</b>
$ git reset --merge ORIG_HEAD        <b>(3)</b>
$ git cherry-pick -Xpatience topic^  <b>(4)</b></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>1. </b>apply the change that would be shown by <b>git show
    topic^</b>. In this example, the patch does not apply cleanly, so
    information about the conflict is written to the index and working tree and
    no new commit results.
  <br/>
  <b>2. </b>summarize changes to be reconciled
  <br/>
  <b>3. </b>cancel the cherry-pick. In other words, return to the
    pre-cherry-pick state, preserving any local modifications you had in the
    working tree.
  <br/>
  <b>4. </b>try to apply the change introduced by <b>topic^</b> again, spending
    extra time to avoid mistakes based on incorrectly matching context
  lines.</p>
