<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">lastcomm</code> gives information on previously
    executed commands. With no arguments, <code class="Nm">lastcomm</code>
    prints information about all the commands recorded during the current
    accounting file's lifetime.</p>
<p class="Pp">Option:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="f"><a class="permalink" href="#f"><code class="Fl">-f</code></a>
    <var class="Ar">file</var></dt>
  <dd>Read from <var class="Ar">file</var> rather than the default accounting
      file.</dd>
  <dt id="w"><a class="permalink" href="#w"><code class="Fl">-w</code></a></dt>
  <dd>Use as many columns as needed to print the output instead of limiting it
      to 80. This is the default behavior on Apple systems.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If called with arguments, only accounting entries with a matching
    <var class="Ar">command</var> name, <var class="Ar">user</var> name, or
    <var class="Ar">terminal</var> name are printed. So, for example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">lastcomm a.out root
  ttyd0</code></div>
<p class="Pp">would produce a listing of all the executions of commands named
    <span class="Pa">a.out</span> by user <var class="Ar">root</var> on the
    terminal <var class="Ar">ttyd0</var>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For each process entry, the following are printed.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet Bd-indent Bl-compact">
  <li>The name of the user who ran the process.</li>
  <li>Flags, as accumulated by the accounting facilities in the system.</li>
  <li>The command name under which the process was called.</li>
  <li>The amount of cpu time used by the process (in seconds).</li>
  <li>The time the process started.</li>
  <li>The elapsed time of the process.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The flags are encoded as follows: &#x201C;S&#x201D; indicates the
    command was executed by the super-user, &#x201C;F&#x201D; indicates the
    command ran after a fork, but without a following
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/exec">exec(3)</a>, &#x201C;C&#x201D; indicates the
    command was run in PDP-11 compatibility mode (VAX only), &#x201C;D&#x201D;
    indicates the command terminated with the generation of a
    <span class="Pa">core</span> file, and &#x201C;X&#x201D; indicates the
    command was terminated with a signal.</p>
