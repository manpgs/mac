<p class="Pp">This page describes the syntax of regular expressions in Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you haven't used regular expressions before, a quick-start
    introduction is available in perlrequick, and a longer tutorial introduction
    is available in perlretut.</p>
<p class="Pp">For reference on how regular expressions are used in matching
    operations, plus various examples of the same, see discussions of
    <span class="Li">&quot;m//&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;??&quot;</span> in &quot;Regexp Quote-Like
    Operators&quot; in perlop.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Modifiers"><a class="permalink" href="#Modifiers">Modifiers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Matching operations can have various modifiers. Modifiers that
    relate to the interpretation of the regular expression inside are listed
    below. Modifiers that alter the way a regular expression is used by Perl are
    detailed in &quot;Regexp Quote-Like Operators&quot; in perlop and &quot;Gory
    details of parsing quoted constructs&quot; in perlop.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="m"><a class="permalink" href="#m">m</a></dt>
  <dd>Treat string as multiple lines. That is, change &quot;^&quot; and
      &quot;$&quot; from matching the start or end of line only at the left and
      right ends of the string to matching them anywhere within the string.</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s">s</a></dt>
  <dd>Treat string as single line. That is, change &quot;.&quot; to match any
      character whatsoever, even a newline, which normally it would not match.
    <p class="Pp">Used together, as <span class="Li">&quot;/ms&quot;</span>,
        they let the &quot;.&quot; match any character whatsoever, while still
        allowing &quot;^&quot; and &quot;$&quot; to match, respectively, just
        after and just before newlines within the string.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i">i</a></dt>
  <dd>Do case-insensitive pattern matching.
    <p class="Pp">If locale matching rules are in effect, the case map is taken
        from the current locale for code points less than 255, and from Unicode
        rules for larger code points. However, matches that would cross the
        Unicode rules/non-Unicode rules boundary (ords 255/256) will not
        succeed. See perllocale.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There are a number of Unicode characters that match multiple
        characters under <span class="Li">&quot;/i&quot;</span>. For example,
        <span class="Li">&quot;LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI&quot;</span> should match
        the sequence <span class="Li">&quot;fi&quot;</span>. Perl is not
        currently able to do this when the multiple characters are in the
        pattern and are split between groupings, or when one or more are
        quantified. Thus</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
 &quot;\N{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI}&quot; =~ /fi/i;          # Matches
 &quot;\N{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI}&quot; =~ /[fi][fi]/i;    # Doesn't match!
 &quot;\N{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI}&quot; =~ /fi*/i;         # Doesn't match!

 # The below doesn't match, and it isn't clear what $1 and $2 would
 # be even if it did!!
 &quot;\N{LATIN SMALL LIGATURE FI}&quot; =~ /(f)(i)/i;      # Doesn't match!
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Perl doesn't match multiple characters in a bracketed
        character class unless the character that maps to them is explicitly
        mentioned, and it doesn't match them at all if the character class is
        inverted, which otherwise could be highly confusing. See &quot;Bracketed
        Character Classes&quot; in perlrecharclass, and &quot;Negation&quot; in
        perlrecharclass.</p>

      Unlike i, m, s and x, these two flags affect the way the regex is used
      rather than the regex itself. See &quot;Using regular expressions in
      Perl&quot; in perlretut for further explanation of the g and c
    modifiers.</dd>
  <dt id="a,"><a class="permalink" href="#a,">a, d, l and u</a></dt>
  <dd>These modifiers, all new in 5.14, affect which character-set semantics
      (Unicode, etc.) are used, as described below in &quot;Character set
      modifiers&quot;.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Regular expression modifiers are usually written in documentation
    as e.g., &quot;the <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span> modifier&quot;,
    even though the delimiter in question might not really be a slash. The
    modifiers <span class="Li">&quot;/imsxadlup&quot;</span> may also be
    embedded within the regular expression itself using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;(?...)&quot;</span> construct, see &quot;Extended
    Patterns&quot; below.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>/x</i></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span> tells the regular
    expression parser to ignore most whitespace that is neither backslashed nor
    within a character class. You can use this to break up your regular
    expression into (slightly) more readable parts. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> character is also treated as a
    metacharacter introducing a comment, just as in ordinary Perl code. This
    also means that if you want real whitespace or
    <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> characters in the pattern (outside a
    character class, where they are unaffected by
    <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span>), then you'll either have to escape
    them (using backslashes or <span class="Li">&quot;\Q...\E&quot;</span>) or
    encode them using octal, hex, or <span class="Li">&quot;\N{}&quot;</span>
    escapes. Taken together, these features go a long way towards making Perl's
    regular expressions more readable. Note that you have to be careful not to
    include the pattern delimiter in the comment--perl has no way of knowing you
    did not intend to close the pattern early. See the C-comment deletion code
    in perlop. Also note that anything inside a
    <span class="Li">&quot;\Q...\E&quot;</span> stays unaffected by
    <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span>. And note that
    <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span> doesn't affect space interpretation
    within a single multi-character construct. For example in
    <span class="Li">&quot;\x{...}&quot;</span>, regardless of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span> modifier, there can be no spaces.
    Same for a quantifier such as <span class="Li">&quot;{3}&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;{5,}&quot;</span>. Similarly,
    <span class="Li">&quot;(?:...)&quot;</span> can't have a space between the
    <span class="Li">&quot;(&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;?&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;:&quot;</span>. Within any delimiters for such a
    construct, allowed spaces are not affected by
    <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span>, and depend on the construct. For
    example, <span class="Li">&quot;\x{...}&quot;</span> can't have spaces
    because hexadecimal numbers don't have spaces in them. But, Unicode
    properties can have spaces, so in
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{...}&quot;</span> there can be spaces that follow
    the Unicode rules, for which see &quot;Properties accessible through \p{}
    and \P{}&quot; in perluniprops.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Character set modifiers</i></p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;/d&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;/u&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;/a&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;/l&quot;</span>, available starting in 5.14, are
    called the character set modifiers; they affect the character set semantics
    used for the regular expression.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;/d&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;/u&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;/l&quot;</span> modifiers are not likely to be of
    much use to you, and so you need not worry about them very much. They exist
    for Perl's internal use, so that complex regular expression data structures
    can be automatically serialized and later exactly reconstituted, including
    all their nuances. But, since Perl can't keep a secret, and there may be
    rare instances where they are useful, they are documented here.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;/a&quot;</span> modifier, on the other
    hand, may be useful. Its purpose is to allow code that is to work mostly on
    ASCII data to not have to concern itself with Unicode.</p>
<p class="Pp">Briefly, <span class="Li">&quot;/l&quot;</span> sets the character
    set to that of whatever <b>L</b>ocale is in effect at the time of the
    execution of the pattern match.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;/u&quot;</span> sets the character set to
    <b>U</b>nicode.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;/a&quot;</span> also sets the character set
    to Unicode, BUT adds several restrictions for <b>A</b>SCII-safe
  matching.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;/d&quot;</span> is the old, problematic,
    pre-5.14 <b>D</b>efault character set behavior. Its only use is to force
    that old behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">At any given time, exactly one of these modifiers is in effect.
    Their existence allows Perl to keep the originally compiled behavior of a
    regular expression, regardless of what rules are in effect when it is
    actually executed. And if it is interpolated into a larger regex, the
    original's rules continue to apply to it, and only it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;/l&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;/u&quot;</span> modifiers are automatically selected
    for regular expressions compiled within the scope of various pragmas, and we
    recommend that in general, you use those pragmas instead of specifying these
    modifiers explicitly. For one thing, the modifiers affect only pattern
    matching, and do not extend to even any replacement done, whereas using the
    pragmas give consistent results for all appropriate operations within their
    scopes. For example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
 s/foo/\Ubar/il
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will match &quot;foo&quot; using the locale's rules for
    case-insensitive matching, but the <span class="Li">&quot;/l&quot;</span>
    does not affect how the <span class="Li">&quot;\U&quot;</span> operates.
    Most likely you want both of them to use locale rules. To do this, instead
    compile the regular expression within the scope of
    <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span>. This both implicitly adds
    the <span class="Li">&quot;/l&quot;</span> and applies locale rules to the
    <span class="Li">&quot;\U&quot;</span>. The lesson is to
    <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> and not
    <span class="Li">&quot;/l&quot;</span> explicitly.</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, it would be better to use <span class="Li">&quot;use
    feature 'unicode_strings'&quot;</span> instead of,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
 s/foo/\Lbar/iu
</pre>
<p class="Pp">to get Unicode rules, as the
    <span class="Li">&quot;\L&quot;</span> in the former (but not necessarily
    the latter) would also use Unicode rules.</p>
<p class="Pp">More detail on each of the modifiers follows. Most likely you
    don't need to know this detail for <span class="Li">&quot;/l&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;/u&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;/d&quot;</span>, and can skip ahead to /a.</p>
<p class="Pp">/l</p>
<p class="Pp">means to use the current locale's rules (see perllocale) when
    pattern matching. For example, <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span> will
    match the &quot;word&quot; characters of that locale, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;/i&quot;</span> case-insensitive matching will match
    according to the locale's case folding rules. The locale used will be the
    one in effect at the time of execution of the pattern match. This may not be
    the same as the compilation-time locale, and can differ from one match to
    another if there is an intervening call of the <i>setlocale()</i>
  function.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl only supports single-byte locales. This means that code
    points above 255 are treated as Unicode no matter what locale is in effect.
    Under Unicode rules, there are a few case-insensitive matches that cross the
    255/256 boundary. These are disallowed under
    <span class="Li">&quot;/l&quot;</span>. For example, 0xFF (on ASCII
    platforms) does not caselessly match the character at 0x178,
    <span class="Li">&quot;LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y WITH DIAERESIS&quot;</span>,
    because 0xFF may not be <span class="Li">&quot;LATIN SMALL LETTER Y WITH
    DIAERESIS&quot;</span> in the current locale, and Perl has no way of knowing
    if that character even exists in the locale, much less what code point it
    is.</p>
<p class="Pp">This modifier may be specified to be the default by
    <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span>, but see &quot;Which
    character set modifier is in effect?&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">/u</p>
<p class="Pp">means to use Unicode rules when pattern matching. On ASCII
    platforms, this means that the code points between 128 and 255 take on their
    Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1) meanings (which are the same as Unicode's). (Otherwise
    Perl considers their meanings to be undefined.) Thus, under this modifier,
    the ASCII platform effectively becomes a Unicode platform; and hence, for
    example, <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span> will match any of the more
    than 100_000 word characters in Unicode.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike most locales, which are specific to a language and country
    pair, Unicode classifies all the characters that are letters
    <i>somewhere</i> in the world as <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span>. For
    example, your locale might not think that <span class="Li">&quot;LATIN
    SMALL</span> <span class="Li">LETTER ETH&quot;</span> is a letter (unless
    you happen to speak Icelandic), but Unicode does. Similarly, all the
    characters that are decimal digits somewhere in the world will match
    <span class="Li">&quot;\d&quot;</span>; this is hundreds, not 10, possible
    matches. And some of those digits look like some of the 10 ASCII digits, but
    mean a different number, so a human could easily think a number is a
    different quantity than it really is. For example,
    <span class="Li">&quot;BENGALI DIGIT FOUR&quot;</span> (U+09EA) looks very
    much like an <span class="Li">&quot;ASCII DIGIT EIGHT&quot;</span> (U+0038).
    And, <span class="Li">&quot;\d+&quot;</span>, may match strings of digits
    that are a mixture from different writing systems, creating a security
    issue. &quot;<i>num()</i>&quot; in Unicode::UCD can be used to sort this
    out. Or the <span class="Li">&quot;/a&quot;</span> modifier can be used to
    force <span class="Li">&quot;\d&quot;</span> to match just the ASCII 0
    through 9.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also, under this modifier, case-insensitive matching works on the
    full set of Unicode characters. The <span class="Li">&quot;KELVIN
    SIGN&quot;</span>, for example matches the letters &quot;k&quot; and
    &quot;K&quot;; and <span class="Li">&quot;LATIN SMALL LIGATURE
    FF&quot;</span> matches the sequence &quot;ff&quot;, which, if you're not
    prepared, might make it look like a hexadecimal constant, presenting another
    potential security issue. See &lt;http://unicode.org/reports/tr36&gt; for a
    detailed discussion of Unicode security issues.</p>
<p class="Pp">This modifier may be specified to be the default by
    <span class="Li">&quot;use feature</span>
    <span class="Li">'unicode_strings&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;use
    locale ':not_characters'&quot;</span>, or <span class="Li">&quot;use
    5.012&quot;</span> (or higher), but see &quot;Which character set modifier
    is in effect?&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">/d</p>
<p class="Pp">This modifier means to use the &quot;Default&quot; native rules of
    the platform except when there is cause to use Unicode rules instead, as
    follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>the target string is encoded in UTF-8; or</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>the pattern is encoded in UTF-8; or</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>the pattern explicitly mentions a code point that is above 255 (say by
      <span class="Li">&quot;\x{100}&quot;</span>); or</dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>the pattern uses a Unicode name
      (<span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span>); or</dd>
  <dt>5.</dt>
  <dd>the pattern uses a Unicode property
      (<span class="Li">&quot;\p{...}&quot;</span>); or</dd>
  <dt>6.</dt>
  <dd>the pattern uses &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;(?[
    ])&quot;</span>&quot;</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Another mnemonic for this modifier is &quot;Depends&quot;, as the
    rules actually used depend on various things, and as a result you can get
    unexpected results. See &quot;The &quot;Unicode Bug&quot;&quot; in
    perlunicode. The Unicode Bug has become rather infamous, leading to yet
    another (printable) name for this modifier, &quot;Dodgy&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless the pattern or string are encoded in UTF-8, only ASCII
    characters can match positively.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here are some examples of how that works on an ASCII platform:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
 $str =  &quot;\xDF&quot;;      # $str is not in UTF-8 format.
 $str =~ /^\w/;       # No match, as $str isn't in UTF-8 format.
 $str .= &quot;\x{0e0b}&quot;;  # Now $str is in UTF-8 format.
 $str =~ /^\w/;       # Match! $str is now in UTF-8 format.
 chop $str;
 $str =~ /^\w/;       # Still a match! $str remains in UTF-8 format.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This modifier is automatically selected by default when none of
    the others are, so yet another name for it is &quot;Default&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because of the unexpected behaviors associated with this modifier,
    you probably should only use it to maintain weird backward
  compatibilities.</p>
<p class="Pp">/a (and /aa)</p>
<p class="Pp">This modifier stands for ASCII-restrict (or ASCII-safe). This
    modifier, unlike the others, may be doubled-up to increase its effect.</p>
<p class="Pp">When it appears singly, it causes the sequences
    <span class="Li">&quot;\d&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\s&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span>, and the Posix character classes to
    match only in the ASCII range. They thus revert to their pre-5.6,
    pre-Unicode meanings. Under <span class="Li">&quot;/a&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\d&quot;</span> always means precisely the digits
    <span class="Li">&quot;0&quot;</span> to
    <span class="Li">&quot;9&quot;</span>;
    <span class="Li">&quot;\s&quot;</span> means the five characters
    <span class="Li">&quot;[ \f\n\r\t]&quot;</span>, and starting in Perl v5.18,
    experimentally, the vertical tab; <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span>
    means the 63 characters <span class="Li">&quot;[A-Za-z0-9_]&quot;</span>;
    and likewise, all the Posix classes such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;[[:print:]]&quot;</span> match only the appropriate
    ASCII-range characters.</p>
<p class="Pp">This modifier is useful for people who only incidentally use
    Unicode, and who do not wish to be burdened with its complexities and
    security concerns.</p>
<p class="Pp">With <span class="Li">&quot;/a&quot;</span>, one can write
    <span class="Li">&quot;\d&quot;</span> with confidence that it will only
    match ASCII characters, and should the need arise to match beyond ASCII, you
    can instead use <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Digit}&quot;</span> (or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{Word}&quot;</span> for
    <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span>). There are similar
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{...}&quot;</span> constructs that can match beyond
    ASCII both white space (see &quot;Whitespace&quot; in perlrecharclass), and
    Posix classes (see &quot;POSIX Character Classes&quot; in perlrecharclass).
    Thus, this modifier doesn't mean you can't use Unicode, it means that to get
    Unicode matching you must explicitly use a construct
    (<span class="Li">&quot;\p{}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\P{}&quot;</span>) that signals Unicode.</p>
<p class="Pp">As you would expect, this modifier causes, for example,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\D&quot;</span> to mean the same thing as
    <span class="Li">&quot;[^0-9]&quot;</span>; in fact, all non-ASCII
    characters match <span class="Li">&quot;\D&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\S&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\W&quot;</span>.
    <span class="Li">&quot;\b&quot;</span> still means to match at the boundary
    between <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\W&quot;</span>, using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;/a&quot;</span> definitions of them (similarly for
    <span class="Li">&quot;\B&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Otherwise, <span class="Li">&quot;/a&quot;</span> behaves like the
    <span class="Li">&quot;/u&quot;</span> modifier, in that case-insensitive
    matching uses Unicode semantics; for example, &quot;k&quot; will match the
    Unicode <span class="Li">&quot;\N{KELVIN SIGN}&quot;</span> under
    <span class="Li">&quot;/i&quot;</span> matching, and code points in the
    Latin1 range, above ASCII will have Unicode rules when it comes to
    case-insensitive matching.</p>
<p class="Pp">To forbid ASCII/non-ASCII matches (like &quot;k&quot; with
    <span class="Li">&quot;\N{KELVIN SIGN}&quot;</span>), specify the
    &quot;a&quot; twice, for example <span class="Li">&quot;/aai&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;/aia&quot;</span>. (The first occurrence of
    &quot;a&quot; restricts the <span class="Li">&quot;\d&quot;</span>, etc.,
    and the second occurrence adds the <span class="Li">&quot;/i&quot;</span>
    restrictions.) But, note that code points outside the ASCII range will use
    Unicode rules for <span class="Li">&quot;/i&quot;</span> matching, so the
    modifier doesn't really restrict things to just ASCII; it just forbids the
    intermixing of ASCII and non-ASCII.</p>
<p class="Pp">To summarize, this modifier provides protection for applications
    that don't wish to be exposed to all of Unicode. Specifying it twice gives
    added protection.</p>
<p class="Pp">This modifier may be specified to be the default by
    <span class="Li">&quot;use re '/a'&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;use re '/aa'&quot;</span>. If you do so, you may
    actually have occasion to use the <span class="Li">&quot;/u&quot;</span>
    modifier explictly if there are a few regular expressions where you do want
    full Unicode rules (but even here, it's best if everything were under
    feature <span class="Li">&quot;unicode_strings&quot;</span>, along with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;use re '/aa'&quot;</span>). Also see &quot;Which
    character set modifier is in effect?&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Which character set modifier is in effect?</p>
<p class="Pp">Which of these modifiers is in effect at any given point in a
    regular expression depends on a fairly complex set of interactions. These
    have been designed so that in general you don't have to worry about it, but
    this section gives the gory details. As explained below in &quot;Extended
    Patterns&quot; it is possible to explicitly specify modifiers that apply
    only to portions of a regular expression. The innermost always has priority
    over any outer ones, and one applying to the whole expression has priority
    over any of the default settings that are described in the remainder of this
    section.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;use re '/foo'&quot;</span> pragma can
    be used to set default modifiers (including these) for regular expressions
    compiled within its scope. This pragma has precedence over the other pragmas
    listed below that also change the defaults.</p>
<p class="Pp">Otherwise, <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> sets the
    default modifier to <span class="Li">&quot;/l&quot;</span>; and
    <span class="Li">&quot;use feature 'unicode_strings&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;use 5.012&quot;</span> (or higher) set the default to
    <span class="Li">&quot;/u&quot;</span> when not in the same scope as either
    <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;use
    bytes&quot;</span>. (<span class="Li">&quot;use locale
    ':not_characters'&quot;</span> also sets the default to
    <span class="Li">&quot;/u&quot;</span>, overriding any plain
    <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span>.) Unlike the mechanisms
    mentioned above, these affect operations besides regular expressions pattern
    matching, and so give more consistent results with other operators,
    including using <span class="Li">&quot;\U&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\l&quot;</span>, etc. in substitution
  replacements.</p>
<p class="Pp">If none of the above apply, for backwards compatibility reasons,
    the <span class="Li">&quot;/d&quot;</span> modifier is the one in effect by
    default. As this can lead to unexpected results, it is best to specify which
    other rule set should be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Character set modifier behavior prior to Perl 5.14</p>
<p class="Pp">Prior to 5.14, there were no explicit modifiers, but
    <span class="Li">&quot;/l&quot;</span> was implied for regexes compiled
    within the scope of <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;/d&quot;</span> was implied otherwise. However,
    interpolating a regex into a larger regex would ignore the original
    compilation in favor of whatever was in effect at the time of the second
    compilation. There were a number of inconsistencies (bugs) with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;/d&quot;</span> modifier, where Unicode rules would
    be used when inappropriate, and vice versa.
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{}&quot;</span> did not imply Unicode rules, and
    neither did all occurrences of <span class="Li">&quot;\N{}&quot;</span>,
    until 5.12.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Regular_Expressions"><a class="permalink" href="#Regular_Expressions">Regular
  Expressions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><i>Metacharacters</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The patterns used in Perl pattern matching evolved from those
    supplied in the Version 8 regex routines. (The routines are derived
    (distantly) from Henry Spencer's freely redistributable reimplementation of
    the V8 routines.) See &quot;Version 8 Regular Expressions&quot; for
  details.</p>
<p class="Pp">In particular the following metacharacters have their standard
    <i>egrep</i>-ish meanings:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    \        Quote the next metacharacter
    ^        Match the beginning of the line
    .        Match any character (except newline)
    $        Match the end of the line (or before newline at the end)
    |        Alternation
    ()       Grouping
    []       Bracketed Character class
</pre>
<p class="Pp">By default, the &quot;^&quot; character is guaranteed to match
    only the beginning of the string, the &quot;$&quot; character only the end
    (or before the newline at the end), and Perl does certain optimizations with
    the assumption that the string contains only one line. Embedded newlines
    will not be matched by &quot;^&quot; or &quot;$&quot;. You may, however,
    wish to treat a string as a multi-line buffer, such that the &quot;^&quot;
    will match after any newline within the string (except if the newline is the
    last character in the string), and &quot;$&quot; will match before any
    newline. At the cost of a little more overhead, you can do this by using the
    /m modifier on the pattern match operator. (Older programs did this by
    setting <span class="Li">$*</span>, but this option was removed in perl
    5.10.)</p>
<p class="Pp">To simplify multi-line substitutions, the &quot;.&quot; character
    never matches a newline unless you use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;/s&quot;</span> modifier, which in effect tells Perl
    to pretend the string is a single line--even if it isn't.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Quantifiers</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The following standard quantifiers are recognized:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    *           Match 0 or more times
    +           Match 1 or more times
    ?           Match 1 or 0 times
    {n}         Match exactly n times
    {n,}        Match at least n times
    {n,m}       Match at least n but not more than m times
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(If a curly bracket occurs in any other context and does not form
    part of a backslashed sequence like
    <span class="Li">&quot;\x{...}&quot;</span>, it is treated as a regular
    character. In particular, the lower quantifier bound is not optional, and a
    typo in a quantifier silently causes it to be treated as the literal
    characters. For example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    /o{4,3}/
</pre>
<p class="Pp">looks like a quantifier that matches 0 times, since 4 is greater
    than 3, but it really means to match the sequence of six characters
    <span class="Li">&quot;o&#x00A0;{&#x00A0;4&#x00A0;,&#x00A0;3&#x00A0;}&quot;</span>.
    It is planned to eventually require literal uses of curly brackets to be
    escaped, say by preceding them with a backslash or enclosing them within
    square brackets, (<span class="Li">&quot;\{&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;[{]&quot;</span>). This change will allow for future
    syntax extensions (like making the lower bound of a quantifier optional),
    and better error checking. In the meantime, you should get in the habit of
    escaping all instances where you mean a literal &quot;{&quot;.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The &quot;*&quot; quantifier is equivalent to
    <span class="Li">&quot;{0,}&quot;</span>, the &quot;+&quot; quantifier to
    <span class="Li">&quot;{1,}&quot;</span>, and the &quot;?&quot; quantifier
    to <span class="Li">&quot;{0,1}&quot;</span>. n and m are limited to
    non-negative integral values less than a preset limit defined when perl is
    built. This is usually 32766 on the most common platforms. The actual limit
    can be seen in the error message generated by code such as this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $_ **= $_ , / {$_} / for 2 .. 42;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">By default, a quantified subpattern is &quot;greedy&quot;, that
    is, it will match as many times as possible (given a particular starting
    location) while still allowing the rest of the pattern to match. If you want
    it to match the minimum number of times possible, follow the quantifier with
    a &quot;?&quot;. Note that the meanings don't change, just the
    &quot;greediness&quot;:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    *?        Match 0 or more times, not greedily
    +?        Match 1 or more times, not greedily
    ??        Match 0 or 1 time, not greedily
    {n}?      Match exactly n times, not greedily (redundant)
    {n,}?     Match at least n times, not greedily
    {n,m}?    Match at least n but not more than m times, not greedily
</pre>
<p class="Pp">By default, when a quantified subpattern does not allow the rest
    of the overall pattern to match, Perl will backtrack. However, this
    behaviour is sometimes undesirable. Thus Perl provides the
    &quot;possessive&quot; quantifier form as well.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
 *+     Match 0 or more times and give nothing back
 ++     Match 1 or more times and give nothing back
 ?+     Match 0 or 1 time and give nothing back
 {n}+   Match exactly n times and give nothing back (redundant)
 {n,}+  Match at least n times and give nothing back
 {n,m}+ Match at least n but not more than m times and give nothing back
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For instance,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   'aaaa' =~ /a++a/
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will never match, as the <span class="Li">&quot;a++&quot;</span>
    will gobble up all the <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>'s in the string
    and won't leave any for the remaining part of the pattern. This feature can
    be extremely useful to give perl hints about where it shouldn't backtrack.
    For instance, the typical &quot;match a double-quoted string&quot; problem
    can be most efficiently performed when written as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   /&quot;(?:[^&quot;\\]++|\\.)*+&quot;/
</pre>
<p class="Pp">as we know that if the final quote does not match, backtracking
    will not help. See the independent subexpression
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;(?&gt;pattern)&quot;</span>&quot; for more
    details; possessive quantifiers are just syntactic sugar for that construct.
    For instance the above example could also be written as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   /&quot;(?&gt;(?:(?&gt;[^&quot;\\]+)|\\.)*)&quot;/
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Escape sequences</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Because patterns are processed as double-quoted strings, the
    following also work:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
 \t          tab                   (HT, TAB)
 \n          newline               (LF, NL)
 \r          return                (CR)
 \f          form feed             (FF)
 \a          alarm (bell)          (BEL)
 \e          escape (think troff)  (ESC)
 \cK         control char          (example: VT)
 \x{}, \x00  character whose ordinal is the given hexadecimal number
 \N{name}    named Unicode character or character sequence
 \N{U+263D}  Unicode character     (example: FIRST QUARTER MOON)
 \o{}, \000  character whose ordinal is the given octal number
 \l          lowercase next char (think vi)
 \u          uppercase next char (think vi)
 \L          lowercase till \E (think vi)
 \U          uppercase till \E (think vi)
 \Q          quote (disable) pattern metacharacters till \E
 \E          end either case modification or quoted section, think vi

<p class="Pp"><i>Character Classes and other Special Escapes</i></p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, Perl defines the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
 Sequence   Note    Description
  [...]     [1]  Match a character according to the rules of the
                   bracketed character class defined by the &quot;...&quot;.
                   Example: [a-z] matches &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; or &quot;c&quot; ... or &quot;z&quot;
  [[:...:]] [2]  Match a character according to the rules of the POSIX
                   character class &quot;...&quot; within the outer bracketed
                   character class.  Example: [[:upper:]] matches any
                   uppercase character.
  (?[...])  [8]  Extended bracketed character class
  \w        [3]  Match a &quot;word&quot; character (alphanumeric plus &quot;_&quot;, plus
                   other connector punctuation chars plus Unicode
                   marks)
  \W        [3]  Match a non-&quot;word&quot; character
  \s        [3]  Match a whitespace character
  \S        [3]  Match a non-whitespace character
  \d        [3]  Match a decimal digit character
  \D        [3]  Match a non-digit character
  \pP       [3]  Match P, named property.  Use \p{Prop} for longer names
  \PP       [3]  Match non-P
  \X        [4]  Match Unicode &quot;eXtended grapheme cluster&quot;
  \C             Match a single C-language char (octet) even if that is
                   part of a larger UTF-8 character.  Thus it breaks up
                   characters into their UTF-8 bytes, so you may end up
                   with malformed pieces of UTF-8.  Unsupported in
                   lookbehind.
  \1        [5]  Backreference to a specific capture group or buffer.
                   '1' may actually be any positive integer.
  \g1       [5]  Backreference to a specific or previous group,
  \g{-1}    [5]  The number may be negative indicating a relative
                   previous group and may optionally be wrapped in
                   curly brackets for safer parsing.
  \g{name}  [5]  Named backreference
  \k&lt;name&gt;  [5]  Named backreference
  \K        [6]  Keep the stuff left of the \K, don't include it in $&amp;
  \N        [7]  Any character but \n.  Not affected by /s modifier
  \v        [3]  Vertical whitespace
  \V        [3]  Not vertical whitespace
  \h        [3]  Horizontal whitespace
  \H        [3]  Not horizontal whitespace
  \R        [4]  Linebreak

<p class="Pp"><i>Assertions</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Perl defines the following zero-width assertions:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    \b  Match a word boundary
    \B  Match except at a word boundary
    \A  Match only at beginning of string
    \Z  Match only at end of string, or before newline at the end
    \z  Match only at end of string
    \G  Match only at pos() (e.g. at the end-of-match position
        of prior m//g)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A word boundary (<span class="Li">&quot;\b&quot;</span>) is a spot
    between two characters that has a <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span> on
    one side of it and a <span class="Li">&quot;\W&quot;</span> on the other
    side of it (in either order), counting the imaginary characters off the
    beginning and end of the string as matching a
    <span class="Li">&quot;\W&quot;</span>. (Within character classes
    <span class="Li">&quot;\b&quot;</span> represents backspace rather than a
    word boundary, just as it normally does in any double-quoted string.) The
    <span class="Li">&quot;\A&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\Z&quot;</span> are just like &quot;^&quot; and
    &quot;$&quot;, except that they won't match multiple times when the
    <span class="Li">&quot;/m&quot;</span> modifier is used, while &quot;^&quot;
    and &quot;$&quot; will match at every internal line boundary. To match the
    actual end of the string and not ignore an optional trailing newline, use
    <span class="Li">&quot;\z&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span> assertion can be used
    to chain global matches (using <span class="Li">&quot;m//g&quot;</span>), as
    described in &quot;Regexp Quote-Like Operators&quot; in perlop. It is also
    useful when writing <span class="Li">&quot;lex&quot;</span>-like scanners,
    when you have several patterns that you want to match against consequent
    substrings of your string; see the previous reference. The actual location
    where <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span> will match can also be
    influenced by using <span class="Li">&quot;pos()&quot;</span> as an lvalue:
    see &quot;pos&quot; in perlfunc. Note that the rule for zero-length matches
    (see &quot;Repeated Patterns Matching a Zero-length Substring&quot;) is
    modified somewhat, in that contents to the left of
    <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span> are not counted when determining the
    length of the match. Thus the following will not match forever:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
     my $string = 'ABC';
     pos($string) = 1;
     while ($string =~ /(.\G)/g) {
         print $1;
     }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It will print 'A' and then terminate, as it considers the match to
    be zero-width, and thus will not match at the same position twice in a
  row.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is worth noting that <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span>
    improperly used can result in an infinite loop. Take care when using
    patterns that include <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span> in an
    alternation.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Capture groups</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The bracketing construct <span class="Li">&quot;( ...
    )&quot;</span> creates capture groups (also referred to as capture buffers).
    To refer to the current contents of a group later on, within the same
    pattern, use <span class="Li">&quot;\g1&quot;</span> (or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g{1}&quot;</span>) for the first,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g2&quot;</span> (or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g{2}&quot;</span>) for the second, and so on. This
    is called a <i>backreference</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">There is no limit to the number of captured substrings that you
    may use. Groups are numbered with the leftmost open parenthesis being number
    1, etc. If a group did not match, the associated backreference won't match
    either. (This can happen if the group is optional, or in a different branch
    of an alternation.) You can omit the <span class="Li">&quot;g&quot;</span>,
    and write <span class="Li">&quot;\1&quot;</span>, etc, but there are some
    issues with this form, described below.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also refer to capture groups relatively, by using a
    negative number, so that <span class="Li">&quot;\g-1&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g{-1}&quot;</span> both refer to the immediately
    preceding capture group, and <span class="Li">&quot;\g-2&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g{-2}&quot;</span> both refer to the group before
    it. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
        /
         (Y)            # group 1
         (              # group 2
            (X)         # group 3
            \g{-1}      # backref to group 3
            \g{-3}      # backref to group 1
         )
        /x
</pre>
<p class="Pp">would match the same as <span class="Li">&quot;/(Y) ( (X) \g3 \g1
    )/x&quot;</span>. This allows you to interpolate regexes into larger regexes
    and not have to worry about the capture groups being renumbered.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can dispense with numbers altogether and create named capture
    groups. The notation is
    <span class="Li">&quot;(?&lt;</span><i>name</i><span class="Li">&gt;...)&quot;</span>
    to declare and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g{</span><i>name</i><span class="Li">}&quot;</span>
    to reference. (To be compatible with .Net regular expressions,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g{</span><i>name</i><span class="Li">}&quot;</span>
    may also be written as
    <span class="Li">&quot;\k{</span><i>name</i><span class="Li">}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\k&lt;</span><i>name</i><span class="Li">&gt;&quot;</span>
    or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\k'</span><i>name</i><span class="Li">'&quot;</span>.)
    <i>name</i> must not begin with a number, nor contain hyphens. When
    different groups within the same pattern have the same name, any reference
    to that name assumes the leftmost defined group. Named groups count in
    absolute and relative numbering, and so can also be referred to by those
    numbers. (It's possible to do things with named capture groups that would
    otherwise require <span class="Li">&quot;(??{})&quot;</span>.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Capture group contents are dynamically scoped and available to you
    outside the pattern until the end of the enclosing block or until the next
    successful match, whichever comes first. (See &quot;Compound
    Statements&quot; in perlsyn.) You can refer to them by absolute number
    (using <span class="Li">&quot;$1&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g1&quot;</span>, etc); or by name via the
    <span class="Li">&quot;%+&quot;</span> hash, using
    <span class="Li">&quot;$+{</span><i>name</i><span class="Li">}&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Braces are required in referring to named capture groups, but are
    optional for absolute or relative numbered ones. Braces are safer when
    creating a regex by concatenating smaller strings. For example if you have
    <span class="Li">&quot;qr/$a$b/&quot;</span>, and <span class="Li">$a</span>
    contained <span class="Li">&quot;\g1&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">$b</span> contained <span class="Li">&quot;37&quot;</span>,
    you would get <span class="Li">&quot;/\g137/&quot;</span> which is probably
    not what you intended.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;\g&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\k&quot;</span> notations were introduced in Perl
    5.10.0. Prior to that there were no named nor relative numbered capture
    groups. Absolute numbered groups were referred to using
    <span class="Li">&quot;\1&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\2&quot;</span>, etc., and this notation is still
    accepted (and likely always will be). But it leads to some ambiguities if
    there are more than 9 capture groups, as
    <span class="Li">&quot;\10&quot;</span> could mean either the tenth capture
    group, or the character whose ordinal in octal is 010 (a backspace in
    ASCII). Perl resolves this ambiguity by interpreting
    <span class="Li">&quot;\10&quot;</span> as a backreference only if at least
    10 left parentheses have opened before it. Likewise
    <span class="Li">&quot;\11&quot;</span> is a backreference only if at least
    11 left parentheses have opened before it. And so on.
    <span class="Li">&quot;\1&quot;</span> through
    <span class="Li">&quot;\9&quot;</span> are always interpreted as
    backreferences. There are several examples below that illustrate these
    perils. You can avoid the ambiguity by always using
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g{}&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\g&quot;</span> if you mean capturing groups; and for
    octal constants always using <span class="Li">&quot;\o{}&quot;</span>, or
    for <span class="Li">&quot;\077&quot;</span> and below, using 3 digits
    padded with leading zeros, since a leading zero implies an octal
  constant.</p>
<p class="Pp">The
    <span class="Li">&quot;\</span><i>digit</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
    notation also works in certain circumstances outside the pattern. See
    &quot;Warning on \1 Instead of <span class="Li">$1</span>&quot; below for
    details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples:</p>

<p class="Pp">Several special variables also refer back to portions of the
    previous match. <span class="Li">$+</span> returns whatever the last bracket
    match matched. <span class="Li">$&amp;</span> returns the entire matched
    string. (At one point <span class="Li">$0</span> did also, but now it
    returns the name of the program.) <span class="Li">&quot;$`&quot;</span>
    returns everything before the matched string.
    <span class="Li">&quot;$'&quot;</span> returns everything after the matched
    string. And <span class="Li">$^N</span> contains whatever was matched by the
    most-recently closed group (submatch). <span class="Li">$^N</span> can be
    used in extended patterns (see below), for example to assign a submatch to a
    variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">These special variables, like the
    <span class="Li">&quot;%+&quot;</span> hash and the numbered match variables
    (<span class="Li">$1</span>, <span class="Li">$2</span>,
    <span class="Li">$3</span>, etc.) are dynamically scoped until the end of
    the enclosing block or until the next successful match, whichever comes
    first. (See &quot;Compound Statements&quot; in perlsyn.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b>: Failed matches in Perl do not reset the match
    variables, which makes it easier to write code that tests for a series of
    more specific cases and remembers the best match.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>: Once Perl sees that you need one of
    <span class="Li">$&amp;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;$`&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;$'&quot;</span> anywhere in the program, it has to
    provide them for every pattern match. This may substantially slow your
    program. Perl uses the same mechanism to produce <span class="Li">$1</span>,
    <span class="Li">$2</span>, etc, so you also pay a price for each pattern
    that contains capturing parentheses. (To avoid this cost while retaining the
    grouping behaviour, use the extended regular expression
    <span class="Li">&quot;(?: ... )&quot;</span> instead.) But if you never use
    <span class="Li">$&amp;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;$`&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;$'&quot;</span>, then patterns <i>without</i>
    capturing parentheses will not be penalized. So avoid
    <span class="Li">$&amp;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;$'&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;$`&quot;</span> if you can, but if you can't (and
    some algorithms really appreciate them), once you've used them once, use
    them at will, because you've already paid the price. As of 5.17.4, the
    presence of each of the three variables in a program is recorded separately,
    and depending on circumstances, perl may be able be more efficient knowing
    that only <span class="Li">$&amp;</span> rather than all three have been
    seen, for example.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a workaround for this problem, Perl 5.10.0 introduces
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^PREMATCH}&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^MATCH}&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;${^POSTMATCH}&quot;</span>, which are equivalent to
    <span class="Li">&quot;$`&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">$&amp;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;$'&quot;</span>, <b>except</b> that they are only
    guaranteed to be defined after a successful match that was executed with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;/p&quot;</span> (preserve) modifier. The use of these
    variables incurs no global performance penalty, unlike their punctuation
    char equivalents, however at the trade-off that you have to tell perl when
    you want to use them.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Quoting_metacharacters"><a class="permalink" href="#Quoting_metacharacters">Quoting
  metacharacters</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Backslashed metacharacters in Perl are alphanumeric, such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;\b&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\n&quot;</span>. Unlike some other regular expression
    languages, there are no backslashed symbols that aren't alphanumeric. So
    anything that looks like \\, \(, \), \[, \], \{, or \} is always interpreted
    as a literal character, not a metacharacter. This was once used in a common
    idiom to disable or quote the special meanings of regular expression
    metacharacters in a string that you want to use for a pattern. Simply quote
    all non-&quot;word&quot; characters:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $pattern =~ s/(\W)/\\$1/g;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(If <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> is set, then
    this depends on the current locale.) Today it is more common to use the
    <i>quotemeta()</i> function or the <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span>
    metaquoting escape sequence to disable all metacharacters' special meanings
    like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    /$unquoted\Q$quoted\E$unquoted/
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Beware that if you put literal backslashes (those not inside
    interpolated variables) between <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\E&quot;</span>, double-quotish backslash
    interpolation may lead to confusing results. If you <i>need</i> to use
    literal backslashes within <span class="Li">&quot;\Q...\E&quot;</span>,
    consult &quot;Gory details of parsing quoted constructs&quot; in perlop.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;quotemeta()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\Q&quot;</span> are fully described in

  Patterns</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl also defines a consistent extension syntax for features not
    found in standard tools like <b>awk</b> and <b>lex</b>. The syntax for most
    of these is a pair of parentheses with a question mark as the first thing
    within the parentheses. The character after the question mark indicates the
    extension.</p>
<p class="Pp">The stability of these extensions varies widely. Some have been
    part of the core language for many years. Others are experimental and may
    change without warning or be completely removed. Check the documentation on
    an individual feature to verify its current status.</p>
<p class="Pp">A question mark was chosen for this and for the minimal-matching
    construct because 1) question marks are rare in older regular expressions,
    and 2) whenever you see one, you should stop and &quot;question&quot;
    exactly what is going on. That's psychology....</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;(?#text)&quot;</dt>
  <dd>A comment. The text is ignored. If the
      <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span> modifier enables whitespace
      formatting, a simple <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> will suffice.
      Note that Perl closes the comment as soon as it sees a
      <span class="Li">&quot;)&quot;</span>, so there is no way to put a literal
      <span class="Li">&quot;)&quot;</span> in the comment.</dd>

  <dd>One or more embedded pattern-match modifiers, to be turned on (or turned
      off, if preceded by <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span>) for the
      remainder of the pattern or the remainder of the enclosing pattern group
      (if any).
    <p class="Pp">This is particularly useful for dynamic patterns, such as
        those read in from a configuration file, taken from an argument, or
        specified in a table somewhere. Consider the case where some patterns
        want to be case-sensitive and some do not: The case-insensitive ones
        merely need to include <span class="Li">&quot;(?i)&quot;</span> at the
        front of the pattern. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    $pattern = &quot;foobar&quot;;
    if ( /$pattern/i ) { }

    # more flexible:

    $pattern = &quot;(?i)foobar&quot;;
    if ( /$pattern/ ) { }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">These modifiers are restored at the end of the enclosing
        group. For example,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    ( (?i) blah ) \s+ \g1
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will match <span class="Li">&quot;blah&quot;</span> in any
        case, some spaces, and an exact (<i>including the case</i>!) repetition
        of the previous word, assuming the
        <span class="Li">&quot;/x&quot;</span> modifier, and no
        <span class="Li">&quot;/i&quot;</span> modifier outside this group.</p>
    <p class="Pp">These modifiers do not carry over into named subpatterns
        called in the enclosing group. In other words, a pattern such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;((?i)(?&amp;NAME))&quot;</span> does not change
        the case-sensitivity of the &quot;NAME&quot; pattern.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Any of these modifiers can be set to apply globally to all
        regular expressions compiled within the scope of a
        <span class="Li">&quot;use re&quot;</span>. See &quot;'/flags'
        mode&quot; in re.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Starting in Perl 5.14, a <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span>
        (caret or circumflex accent) immediately after the
        <span class="Li">&quot;?&quot;</span> is a shorthand equivalent to
        <span class="Li">&quot;d-imsx&quot;</span>. Flags (except
        <span class="Li">&quot;d&quot;</span>) may follow the caret to override
        it. But a minus sign is not legal with it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;d&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;l&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;p&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;u&quot;</span> modifiers are special in that they
        can only be enabled, not disabled, and the
        <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;d&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;l&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;u&quot;</span> modifiers are mutually exclusive:
        specifying one de-specifies the others, and a maximum of one (or two
        <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>'s) may appear in the construct.
        Thus, for example, <span class="Li">&quot;(?-p)&quot;</span> will warn
        when compiled under <span class="Li">&quot;use warnings&quot;</span>;
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?-d:...)&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?dl:...)&quot;</span> are fatal errors.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note also that the <span class="Li">&quot;p&quot;</span>

    <p class="Pp">Starting in Perl 5.14, a <span class="Li">&quot;^&quot;</span>
        (caret or circumflex accent) immediately after the

    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    (?x-ims:foo)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The caret tells Perl that this cluster doesn't inherit the
        flags of any surrounding pattern, but uses the system defaults
        (<span class="Li">&quot;d-imsx&quot;</span>), modified by any flags
        specified.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The caret allows for simpler stringification of compiled
        regular expressions. These look like</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    (?^:pattern)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">with any non-default flags appearing between the caret and the
        colon. A test that looks at such stringification thus doesn't need to
        have the system default flags hard-coded in it, just the caret. If new
        flags are added to Perl, the meaning of the caret's expansion will
        change to include the default for those flags, so the test will still
        work, unchanged.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Specifying a negative flag after the caret is an error, as the
        flag is redundant.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Mnemonic for <span class="Li">&quot;(?^...)&quot;</span>: A

  <dd>This is the &quot;branch reset&quot; pattern, which has the special
      property that the capture groups are numbered from the same starting point
      in each alternation branch. It is available starting from perl 5.10.0.
    <p class="Pp">Capture groups are numbered from left to right, but inside
        this construct the numbering is restarted for each branch.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The numbering within each branch will be as normal, and any
        groups following this construct will be numbered as though the construct
        contained only one branch, that being the one with the most capture
        groups in it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This construct is useful when you want to capture one of a
        number of alternative matches.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Consider the following pattern. The numbers underneath show in
        which group the captured content will be stored.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    # before  ---------------branch-reset----------- after        
    / ( a )  (?| x ( y ) z | (p (q) r) | (t) u (v) ) ( z ) /x
    # 1            2         2  3        2     3     4
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Be careful when using the branch reset pattern in combination
        with named captures. Named captures are implemented as being aliases to
        numbered groups holding the captures, and that interferes with the
        implementation of the branch reset pattern. If you are using named
        captures in a branch reset pattern, it's best to use the same names, in
        the same order, in each of the alternations:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   /(?|  (?&lt;a&gt; x ) (?&lt;b&gt; y )
      |  (?&lt;a&gt; z ) (?&lt;b&gt; w )) /x
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Not doing so may lead to surprises:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  &quot;12&quot; =~ /(?| (?&lt;a&gt; \d+ ) | (?&lt;b&gt; \D+))/x;
  say $+ {a};   # Prints '12'
  say $+ {b};   # *Also* prints '12'.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The problem here is that both the group named
        <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> and the group named
        <span class="Li">&quot;b&quot;</span> are aliases for the group
        belonging to <span class="Li">$1</span>.</p>

  <dt id="Look-Around"><a class="permalink" href="#Look-Around">Look-Around
    Assertions</a></dt>
  <dd>Look-around assertions are zero-width patterns which match a specific
      pattern without including it in <span class="Li">$&amp;</span>. Positive
      assertions match when their subpattern matches, negative assertions match
      when their subpattern fails. Look-behind matches text up to the current
      match position, look-ahead matches text following the current match
      position.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;(?=pattern)&quot;</dt>
  <dd>A zero-width positive look-ahead assertion. For example,
      <span class="Li">&quot;/\w+(?=\t)/&quot;</span> matches a word followed by
      a tab, without including the tab in <span class="Li">$&amp;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;(?!pattern)&quot;</dt>
  <dd>A zero-width negative look-ahead assertion. For example
      <span class="Li">&quot;/foo(?!bar)/&quot;</span> matches any occurrence of
      &quot;foo&quot; that isn't followed by &quot;bar&quot;. Note however that
      look-ahead and look-behind are NOT the same thing. You cannot use this for
      look-behind.
    <p class="Pp">If you are looking for a &quot;bar&quot; that isn't preceded
        by a &quot;foo&quot;, <span class="Li">&quot;/(?!foo)bar/&quot;</span>
        will not do what you want. That's because the
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?!foo)&quot;</span> is just saying that the next
        thing cannot be &quot;foo&quot;--and it's not, it's a &quot;bar&quot;,
        so &quot;foobar&quot; will match. Use look-behind instead (see
      below).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;(?&lt;=pattern)&quot; &quot;\K&quot;</dt>
  <dd>A zero-width positive look-behind assertion. For example,
      <span class="Li">&quot;/(?&lt;=\t)\w+/&quot;</span> matches a word that
      follows a tab, without including the tab in
      <span class="Li">$&amp;</span>. Works only for fixed-width look-behind.
    <p class="Pp">There is a special form of this construct, called
        <span class="Li">&quot;\K&quot;</span>, which causes the regex engine to
        &quot;keep&quot; everything it had matched prior to the
        <span class="Li">&quot;\K&quot;</span> and not include it in
        <span class="Li">$&amp;</span>. This effectively provides
        variable-length look-behind. The use of
        <span class="Li">&quot;\K&quot;</span> inside of another look-around
        assertion is allowed, but the behaviour is currently not well
      defined.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For various reasons <span class="Li">&quot;\K&quot;</span> may
        be significantly more efficient than the equivalent
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?&lt;=...)&quot;</span> construct, and it is
        especially useful in situations where you want to efficiently remove

  <dd>A named capture group. Identical in every respect to normal capturing
      parentheses <span class="Li">&quot;()&quot;</span> but for the additional
      fact that the group can be referred to by name in various regular
      expression constructs (like <span class="Li">&quot;\g{NAME}&quot;</span>)
      and can be accessed by name after a successful match via
      <span class="Li">&quot;%+&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;%-&quot;</span>. See perlvar for more details on
      the <span class="Li">&quot;%+&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;%-&quot;</span> hashes.
    <p class="Pp">If multiple distinct capture groups have the same name then
        the $+{NAME} will refer to the leftmost defined group in the match.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The forms <span class="Li">&quot;(?'NAME'pattern)&quot;</span>
        and <span class="Li">&quot;(?&lt;NAME&gt;pattern)&quot;</span> are
        equivalent.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE:</b> While the notation of this construct is the same
        as the similar function in .NET regexes, the behavior is not. In Perl
        the groups are numbered sequentially regardless of being named or not.
        Thus in the pattern</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  /(x)(?&lt;foo&gt;y)(z)/
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">$+{foo} will be the same as <span class="Li">$2</span>, and
        <span class="Li">$3</span> will contain 'z' instead of the opposite
        which is what a .NET regex hacker might expect.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Currently NAME is restricted to simple identifiers only. In
        other words, it must match
        <span class="Li">&quot;/^[_A-Za-z][_A-Za-z0-9]*\z/&quot;</span> or its
        Unicode extension (see utf8), though it isn't extended by the locale
        (see perllocale).</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>NOTE:</b> In order to make things easier for programmers
        with experience with the Python or PCRE regex engines, the pattern
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?P&lt;NAME&gt;pattern)&quot;</span> may be used
        instead of <span class="Li">&quot;(?&lt;NAME&gt;pattern)&quot;</span>;
        however this form does not support the use of single quotes as a

  <dt>&quot;\k'NAME'&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Named backreference. Similar to numeric backreferences, except that the
      group is designated by name and not number. If multiple groups have the
      same name then it refers to the leftmost defined group in the current
      match.
    <p class="Pp">It is an error to refer to a name not defined by a
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?&lt;NAME&gt;)&quot;</span> earlier in the
        pattern.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Both forms are equivalent.</p>

  <dd><b>WARNING</b>: This extended regular expression feature is considered
      experimental, and may be changed without notice. Code executed that has
      side effects may not perform identically from version to version due to
      the effect of future optimisations in the regex engine. The implementation
      of this feature was radically overhauled for the 5.18.0 release, and its
      behaviour in earlier versions of perl was much buggier, especially in
      relation to parsing, lexical vars, scoping, recursion and reentrancy.
    <p class="Pp">This zero-width assertion executes any embedded Perl code. It
        always succeeds, and its return value is set as
        <span class="Li">$^R</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In literal patterns, the code is parsed at the same time as
        the surrounding code. While within the pattern, control is passed
        temporarily back to the perl parser, until the logically-balancing
        closing brace is encountered. This is similar to the way that an array
        index expression in a literal string is handled, for example</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    &quot;abc$array[ 1 + f('[') + g()]def&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In particular, braces do not need to be balanced:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    s/abc(?{ f('{'); })/def/
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Even in a pattern that is interpolated and compiled at
        run-time, literal code blocks will be compiled once, at perl compile
        time; the following prints &quot;ABCD&quot;:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    print &quot;D&quot;;
    my $qr = qr/(?{ BEGIN { print &quot;A&quot; } })/;
    my $foo = &quot;foo&quot;;
    /$foo$qr(?{ BEGIN { print &quot;B&quot; } })/;
    BEGIN { print &quot;C&quot; }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In patterns where the text of the code is derived from
        run-time information rather than appearing literally in a source code
        /pattern/, the code is compiled at the same time that the pattern is
        compiled, and for reasons of security, <span class="Li">&quot;use re
        'eval'&quot;</span> must be in scope. This is to stop user-supplied
        patterns containing code snippets from being executable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In situations where you need to enable this with
        <span class="Li">&quot;use re 'eval'&quot;</span>, you should also have
        taint checking enabled. Better yet, use the carefully constrained
        evaluation within a Safe compartment. See perlsec for details about both
        these mechanisms.</p>
    <p class="Pp">From the viewpoint of parsing, lexical variable scope and
        closures,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    /AAA(?{ BBB })CCC/
    </pre>

    <pre>
    { my $i = 1; $r = qr/(?{ print $i })/ }
    my $i = 2;
    /$r/; # prints &quot;1&quot;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Inside a <span class="Li">&quot;(?{...})&quot;</span> block,
        <span class="Li">$_</span> refers to the string the regular expression
        is matching against. You can also use
        <span class="Li">&quot;pos()&quot;</span> to know what is the current
        position of matching within this string.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The code block introduces a new scope from the perspective of
        lexical variable declarations, but <b>not</b> from the perspective of
        <span class="Li">&quot;local&quot;</span> and similar localizing
        behaviours. So later code blocks within the same pattern will still see
        the values which were localized in earlier blocks. These accumulated
        localizations are undone either at the end of a successful match, or if
        the assertion is backtracked (compare &quot;Backtracking&quot;). For
        example,</p>

   &gt;x;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will initially increment <span class="Li">$cnt</span> up to 8;
        then during backtracking, its value will be unwound back to 4, which is
        the value assigned to <span class="Li">$res</span>. At the end of the
        regex execution, <span class="Li">$cnt</span> will be wound back to its
        initial value of 0.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This assertion may be used as the condition in a</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    (?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">switch. If <i>not</i> used in this way, the result of
        evaluation of <span class="Li">&quot;code&quot;</span> is put into the
        special variable <span class="Li">$^R</span>. This happens immediately,
        so <span class="Li">$^R</span> can be used from other
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?{ code })&quot;</span> assertions inside the
        same regular expression.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The assignment to <span class="Li">$^R</span> above is
        properly localized, so the old value of <span class="Li">$^R</span> is
        restored if the assertion is backtracked; compare
        &quot;Backtracking&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the special variable <span class="Li">$^N</span> is
        particularly useful with code blocks to capture the results of
        submatches in variables without having to keep track of the number of
        nested parentheses. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  $_ = &quot;The brown fox jumps over the lazy dog&quot;;
  /the (\S+)(?{ $color = $^N }) (\S+)(?{ $animal = $^N })/i;

    <p class="Pp">This is a &quot;postponed&quot; regular subexpression. It

        a qr// object), then matched as if it were inserted instead of this
        construct.</p>
    <p class="Pp">During the matching of this sub-pattern, it has its own set of
        captures which are valid during the sub-match, but are discarded once
        control returns to the main pattern. For example, the following matches,

  <dd>Similar to <span class="Li">&quot;(??{ code })&quot;</span> except that it
      does not involve executing any code or potentially compiling a returned
      pattern string; instead it treats the part of the current pattern
      contained within a specified capture group as an independent pattern that
      must match at the current position. Capture groups contained by the
      pattern will have the value as determined by the outermost recursion.
    <p class="Pp"><i>PARNO</i> is a sequence of digits (not starting with 0)
        whose value reflects the paren-number of the capture group to recurse
        to. <span class="Li">&quot;(?R)&quot;</span> recurses to the beginning
        of the whole pattern. <span class="Li">&quot;(?0)&quot;</span> is an
        alternate syntax for <span class="Li">&quot;(?R)&quot;</span>. If
        <i>PARNO</i> is preceded by a plus or minus sign then it is assumed to
        be relative, with negative numbers indicating preceding capture groups
        and positive ones following. Thus
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?-1)&quot;</span> refers to the most recently
        declared group, and <span class="Li">&quot;(?+1)&quot;</span> indicates
        the next group to be declared. Note that the counting for relative
        recursion differs from that of relative backreferences, in that with
        recursion unclosed groups <b>are</b> included.</p>

  <dd>Checks if the numbered capturing group has matched something.</dd>

  <dd>Checks if a group with the given name has matched something.</dd>
  <dt>(?=...) (?!...) (?&lt;=...) (?&lt;!...)</dt>
  <dd>Checks whether the pattern matches (or does not match, for the '!'
      variants).</dd>
  <dt>(?{ CODE })</dt>
  <dd>Treats the return value of the code block as the condition.</dd>
  <dt>(R)</dt>
  <dd>Checks if the expression has been evaluated inside of recursion.</dd>
  <dt>(R1) (R2) ...</dt>
  <dd>Checks if the expression has been evaluated while executing directly
      inside of the n-th capture group. This check is the regex equivalent of
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  if ((caller(0))[3] eq 'subname') { ... }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In other words, it does not check the full recursion
      stack.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>(R&amp;NAME)</dt>
  <dd>Similar to <span class="Li">&quot;(R1)&quot;</span>, this predicate checks
      to see if we're executing directly inside of the leftmost group with a
      given name (this is the same logic used by
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?&amp;NAME)&quot;</span> to disambiguate). It does
      not check the full stack, but only the name of the innermost active
      recursion.</dd>
  <dt>(DEFINE)</dt>
  <dd>In this case, the yes-pattern is never directly executed, and no

<p class="Pp">A special form is the <span class="Li">&quot;(DEFINE)&quot;</span>
    predicate, which never executes its yes-pattern directly, and does not allow
    a no-pattern. This allows one to define subpatterns which will be executed
    only by the recursion mechanism. This way, you can define a set of regular
    expression rules that can be bundled into any pattern you choose.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is recommended that for this usage you put the DEFINE block at
    the end of the pattern, and that you name any subpatterns defined within
  it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also, it's worth noting that patterns defined this way probably
    will not be as efficient, as the optimiser is not very clever about handling
    them.</p>
<p class="Pp">An example of how this might be used is as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>

    accessible after the recursion returns, so the extra layer of capturing
    groups is necessary. Thus <span class="Li">$+{NAME_PAT}</span> would not be
    defined even though <span class="Li">$+{NAME}</span> would be.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, keep in mind that subpatterns created inside a DEFINE
    block count towards the absolute and relative number of captures, so
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    my @captures = &quot;a&quot; =~ /(.)                  # First capture
                           (?(DEFINE)
                               (?&lt;EXAMPLE&gt; 1 )  # Second capture
                           )/x;
    say scalar @captures;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Will output 2, not 1. This is particularly important if you intend
    to compile the definitions with the <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span>
    operator, and later interpolate them in another pattern.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;(?&gt;pattern)&quot;</dt>
  <dd>An &quot;independent&quot; subexpression, one which matches the substring
      that a <i>standalone</i> <span class="Li">&quot;pattern&quot;</span> would
      match if anchored at the given position, and it matches <i>nothing other
      than this substring</i>. This construct is useful for optimizations of
      what would otherwise be &quot;eternal&quot; matches, because it will not
      backtrack (see &quot;Backtracking&quot;). It may also be useful in places
      where the &quot;grab all you can, and do not give anything back&quot;
      semantic is desirable.
    <p class="Pp">For example: <span class="Li">&quot;^(?&gt;a*)ab&quot;</span>
        will never match, since <span class="Li">&quot;(?&gt;a*)&quot;</span>
        (anchored at the beginning of string, as above) will match <i>all</i>
        characters <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> at the beginning of
        string, leaving no <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> for
        <span class="Li">&quot;ab&quot;</span> to match. In contrast,
        <span class="Li">&quot;a*ab&quot;</span> will match the same as
        <span class="Li">&quot;a+b&quot;</span>, since the match of the subgroup
        <span class="Li">&quot;a*&quot;</span> is influenced by the following
        group <span class="Li">&quot;ab&quot;</span> (see
        &quot;Backtracking&quot;). In particular,
        <span class="Li">&quot;a*&quot;</span> inside
        <span class="Li">&quot;a*ab&quot;</span> will match fewer characters
        than a standalone <span class="Li">&quot;a*&quot;</span>, since this
        makes the tail match.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;(?&gt;pattern)&quot;</span> does not
        disable backtracking altogether once it has matched. It is still
        possible to backtrack past the construct, but not into it. So
        <span class="Li">&quot;((?&gt;a*)|(?&gt;b*))ar&quot;</span> will still
        match &quot;bar&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An effect similar to
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?&gt;pattern)&quot;</span> may be achieved by
        writing <span class="Li">&quot;(?=(pattern))\g{-1}&quot;</span>. This
        matches the same substring as a standalone
        <span class="Li">&quot;a+&quot;</span>, and the following
        <span class="Li">&quot;\g{-1}&quot;</span> eats the matched string; it
        therefore makes a zero-length assertion into an analogue of
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?&gt;...)&quot;</span>. (The difference between
        these two constructs is that the second one uses a capturing group, thus
        shifting ordinals of backreferences in the rest of a regular
        expression.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Consider this pattern:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    m{ \(
          (
            [^()]+           # x+
          |
            \( [^()]* \)
          )+
       \)
     }x
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">That will efficiently match a nonempty group with matching
        parentheses two levels deep or less. However, if there is no such group,
        it will take virtually forever on a long string. That's because there
        are so many different ways to split a long string into several
        substrings. This is what <span class="Li">&quot;(.+)+&quot;</span> is
        doing, and <span class="Li">&quot;(.+)+&quot;</span> is similar to a
        subpattern of the above pattern. Consider how the pattern above detects
        no-match on <span class="Li">&quot;((()aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa&quot;</span>
        in several seconds, but that each extra letter doubles this time. This
        exponential performance will make it appear that your program has hung.
        However, a tiny change to this pattern</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    m{ \(
          (
            (?&gt; [^()]+ )        # change x+ above to (?&gt; x+ )
          |
            \( [^()]* \)
          )+
       \)
     }x
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">which uses <span class="Li">&quot;(?&gt;...)&quot;</span>
        matches exactly when the one above does (verifying this yourself would
        be a productive exercise), but finishes in a fourth the time when used
        on a similar string with 1000000 <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>s.
        Be aware, however, that, when this construct is followed by a
        quantifier, it currently triggers a warning message under the
        <span class="Li">&quot;use warnings&quot;</span> pragma or <b>-w</b>
        switch saying it <span class="Li">&quot;matches null string many times
        in regex&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On simple groups, such as the pattern
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?&gt; [^()]+ )&quot;</span>, a comparable effect
        may be achieved by negative look-ahead, as in
        <span class="Li">&quot;[^()]+ (?! [^()] )&quot;</span>. This was only 4
        times slower on a string with 1000000
        <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>s.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The &quot;grab all you can, and do not give anything
        back&quot; semantic is desirable in many situations where on the first
        sight a simple <span class="Li">&quot;()*&quot;</span> looks like the
        correct solution. Suppose we parse text with comments being delimited by
        <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> followed by some optional
        (horizontal) whitespace. Contrary to its appearance,
        <span class="Li">&quot;#[ \t]*&quot;</span> <i>is not</i> the correct
        subexpression to match the comment delimiter, because it may &quot;give
        up&quot; some whitespace if the remainder of the pattern can be made to
        match that way. The correct answer is either one of these:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    (?&gt;#[ \t]*)
    #[ \t]*(?![ \t])
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For example, to grab non-empty comments into
        <span class="Li">$1</span>, one should use either one of these:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    / (?&gt; \# [ \t]* ) (        .+ ) /x;
    /     \# [ \t]*   ( [^ \t] .* ) /x;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Which one you pick depends on which of these expressions
        better reflects the above specification of comments.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In some literature this construct is called &quot;atomic
        matching&quot; or &quot;possessive matching&quot;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Possessive quantifiers are equivalent to putting the item they
        are applied to inside of one of these constructs. The following

<h2 class="Ss" id="Special_Backtracking_Control_Verbs"><a class="permalink" href="#Special_Backtracking_Control_Verbs">Special
  Backtracking Control Verbs</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>WARNING:</b> These patterns are experimental and subject to
    change or removal in a future version of Perl. Their usage in production
    code should be noted to avoid problems during upgrades.</p>
<p class="Pp">These special patterns are generally of the form
    <span class="Li">&quot;(*VERB:ARG)&quot;</span>. Unless otherwise stated the
    ARG argument is optional; in some cases, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any pattern containing a special backtracking verb that allows an
    argument has the special behaviour that when executed it sets the current
    package's <span class="Li">$REGERROR</span> and
    <span class="Li">$REGMARK</span> variables. When doing so the following
    rules apply:</p>
<p class="Pp">On failure, the <span class="Li">$REGERROR</span> variable will be
    set to the ARG value of the verb pattern, if the verb was involved in the
    failure of the match. If the ARG part of the pattern was omitted, then
    <span class="Li">$REGERROR</span> will be set to the name of the last
    <span class="Li">&quot;(*MARK:NAME)&quot;</span> pattern executed, or to
    TRUE if there was none. Also, the <span class="Li">$REGMARK</span> variable
    will be set to FALSE.</p>
<p class="Pp">On a successful match, the <span class="Li">$REGERROR</span>
    variable will be set to FALSE, and the <span class="Li">$REGMARK</span>
    variable will be set to the name of the last
    <span class="Li">&quot;(*MARK:NAME)&quot;</span> pattern executed. See the
    explanation for the <span class="Li">&quot;(*MARK:NAME)&quot;</span> verb
    below for more details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE:</b> <span class="Li">$REGERROR</span> and
    <span class="Li">$REGMARK</span> are not magic variables like
    <span class="Li">$1</span> and most other regex-related variables. They are
    not local to a scope, nor readonly, but instead are volatile package
    variables similar to <span class="Li">$AUTOLOAD</span>. Use
    <span class="Li">&quot;local&quot;</span> to localize changes to them to a
    specific scope if necessary.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a pattern does not contain a special backtracking verb that
    allows an argument, then <span class="Li">$REGERROR</span> and
    <span class="Li">$REGMARK</span> are not touched at all.</p>

  <dt>&quot;(*PRUNE)&quot; &quot;(*PRUNE:NAME)&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This zero-width pattern prunes the backtracking tree at the current point
      when backtracked into on failure. Consider the pattern
      <span class="Li">&quot;A (*PRUNE) B&quot;</span>, where A and B are
      complex patterns. Until the <span class="Li">&quot;(*PRUNE)&quot;</span>
      verb is reached, A may backtrack as necessary to match. Once it is
      reached, matching continues in B, which may also backtrack as necessary;
      however, should B not match, then no further backtracking will take place,
      and the pattern will fail outright at the current starting position.
    <p class="Pp">The following example counts all the possible matching strings
        in a pattern (without actually matching any of them).</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    'aaab' =~ /a+b?(?{print &quot;$&amp;\n&quot;; $count++})(*FAIL)/;
    print &quot;Count=$count\n&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">which produces:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>

    aab
    aa
    a
    ab
    a

    'aaab' =~ /a+b?(*PRUNE)(?{print &quot;$&amp;\n&quot;; $count++})(*FAIL)/;
    print &quot;Count=$count\n&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">we prevent backtracking and find the count of the longest
        matching string at each matching starting point like so:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    aaab
    aab
    ab
    Count=3
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Any number of <span class="Li">&quot;(*PRUNE)&quot;</span>
        assertions may be used in a pattern.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also <span class="Li">&quot;(?&gt;pattern)&quot;</span>
        and possessive quantifiers for other ways to control backtracking. In
        some cases, the use of <span class="Li">&quot;(*PRUNE)&quot;</span> can
        be replaced with a <span class="Li">&quot;(?&gt;pattern)&quot;</span>
        with no functional difference; however,
        <span class="Li">&quot;(*PRUNE)&quot;</span> can be used to handle cases
        that cannot be expressed using a
        <span class="Li">&quot;(?&gt;pattern)&quot;</span> alone.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;(*SKIP)&quot; &quot;(*SKIP:NAME)&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This zero-width pattern is similar to
      <span class="Li">&quot;(*PRUNE)&quot;</span>, except that on failure it
      also signifies that whatever text that was matched leading up to the
      <span class="Li">&quot;(*SKIP)&quot;</span> pattern being executed cannot
      be part of <i>any</i> match of this pattern. This effectively means that
      the regex engine &quot;skips&quot; forward to this position on failure and
      tries to match again, (assuming that there is sufficient room to match).
    <p class="Pp">The name of the
        <span class="Li">&quot;(*SKIP:NAME)&quot;</span> pattern has special
        significance. If a <span class="Li">&quot;(*MARK:NAME)&quot;</span> was
        encountered while matching, then it is that position which is used as
        the &quot;skip point&quot;. If no
        <span class="Li">&quot;(*MARK)&quot;</span> of that name was
        encountered, then the <span class="Li">&quot;(*SKIP)&quot;</span>
        operator has no effect. When used without a name the &quot;skip
        point&quot; is where the match point was when executing the (*SKIP)
        pattern.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Compare the following to the examples in
        <span class="Li">&quot;(*PRUNE)&quot;</span>; note the string is twice
        as long:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
 'aaabaaab' =~ /a+b?(*SKIP)(?{print &quot;$&amp;\n&quot;; $count++})(*FAIL)/;
 print &quot;Count=$count\n&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">outputs</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    aaab
    aaab
    Count=2
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Once the 'aaab' at the start of the string has matched, and
        the <span class="Li">&quot;(*SKIP)&quot;</span> executed, the next
        starting point will be where the cursor was when the
        <span class="Li">&quot;(*SKIP)&quot;</span> was executed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;(*MARK:NAME)&quot; &quot;(*:NAME)&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This zero-width pattern can be used to mark the point reached in a string
      when a certain part of the pattern has been successfully matched. This
      mark may be given a name. A later
      <span class="Li">&quot;(*SKIP)&quot;</span> pattern will then skip forward
      to that point if backtracked into on failure. Any number of
      <span class="Li">&quot;(*MARK)&quot;</span> patterns are allowed, and the
      NAME portion may be duplicated.
    <p class="Pp">In addition to interacting with the
        <span class="Li">&quot;(*SKIP)&quot;</span> pattern,
        <span class="Li">&quot;(*MARK:NAME)&quot;</span> can be used to
        &quot;label&quot; a pattern branch, so that after matching, the program
        can determine which branches of the pattern were involved in the
      match.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When a match is successful, the
        <span class="Li">$REGMARK</span> variable will be set to the name of the
        most recently executed <span class="Li">&quot;(*MARK:NAME)&quot;</span>
        that was involved in the match.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This can be used to determine which branch of a pattern was
        matched without using a separate capture group for each branch, which in
        turn can result in a performance improvement, as perl cannot optimize
        <span class="Li">&quot;/(?:(x)|(y)|(z))/&quot;</span> as efficiently as
        something like
        <span class="Li">&quot;/(?:x(*MARK:x)|y(*MARK:y)|z(*MARK:z))/&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When a match has failed, and unless another verb has been
        involved in failing the match and has provided its own name to use, the
        <span class="Li">$REGERROR</span> variable will be set to the name of
        the most recently executed
        <span class="Li">&quot;(*MARK:NAME)&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See &quot;(*SKIP)&quot; for more details.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As a shortcut <span class="Li">&quot;(*MARK:NAME)&quot;</span>
        can be written <span class="Li">&quot;(*:NAME)&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;(*THEN)&quot; &quot;(*THEN:NAME)&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This is similar to the &quot;cut group&quot; operator
      <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span> from Perl 6. Like
      <span class="Li">&quot;(*PRUNE)&quot;</span>, this verb always matches,
      and when backtracked into on failure, it causes the regex engine to try
      the next alternation in the innermost enclosing group (capturing or
      otherwise) that has alternations. The two branches of a
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)&quot;</span>
      do not count as an alternation, as far as
      <span class="Li">&quot;(*THEN)&quot;</span> is concerned.
    <p class="Pp">Its name comes from the observation that this operation
        combined with the alternation operator
        (<span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>) can be used to create what is
        essentially a pattern-based if/then/else block:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  ( COND (*THEN) FOO | COND2 (*THEN) BAR | COND3 (*THEN) BAZ )
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that if this operator is used and NOT inside of an
        alternation then it acts exactly like the
        <span class="Li">&quot;(*PRUNE)&quot;</span> operator.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  / A (*PRUNE) B /
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is the same as</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  / A (*THEN) B /
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">but</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  / ( A (*THEN) B | C ) /
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is not the same as</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  / ( A (*PRUNE) B | C ) /
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">as after matching the A but failing on the B the
        <span class="Li">&quot;(*THEN)&quot;</span> verb will backtrack and try
        C; but the <span class="Li">&quot;(*PRUNE)&quot;</span> verb will simply
        fail.</p>

        of capturing groups then the groups are marked as ended at the point at
        which the <span class="Li">&quot;(*ACCEPT)&quot;</span> was encountered.
        For instance:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  'AB' =~ /(A (A|B(*ACCEPT)|C) D)(E)/x;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will match, and <span class="Li">$1</span> will be
        <span class="Li">&quot;AB&quot;</span> and <span class="Li">$2</span>
        will be <span class="Li">&quot;B&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">$3</span> will not be set. If another branch in the
        inner parentheses was matched, such as in the string 'ACDE', then the
        <span class="Li">&quot;D&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;E&quot;</span> would have to be matched as
      well.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Backtracking"><a class="permalink" href="#Backtracking">Backtracking</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: This section presents an abstract approximation of regular
    expression behavior. For a more rigorous (and complicated) view of the rules
    involved in selecting a match among possible alternatives, see
    &quot;Combining RE Pieces&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">A fundamental feature of regular expression matching involves the
    notion called <i>backtracking</i>, which is currently used (when needed) by
    all regular non-possessive expression quantifiers, namely
    <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;*?&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;+?&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;{n,m}&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;{n,m}?&quot;</span>. Backtracking is often optimized
    internally, but the general principle outlined here is valid.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a regular expression to match, the <i>entire</i> regular
    expression must match, not just part of it. So if the beginning of a pattern
    containing a quantifier succeeds in a way that causes later parts in the
    pattern to fail, the matching engine backs up and recalculates the beginning
    part--that's why it's called backtracking.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is an example of backtracking: Let's say you want to find the
    word following &quot;foo&quot; in the string &quot;Food is on the foo
    table.&quot;:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $_ = &quot;Food is on the foo table.&quot;;
    if ( /\b(foo)\s+(\w+)/i ) {
        print &quot;$2 follows $1.\n&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When the match runs, the first part of the regular expression
    (<span class="Li">&quot;\b(foo)&quot;</span>) finds a possible match right
    at the beginning of the string, and loads up <span class="Li">$1</span> with
    &quot;Foo&quot;. However, as soon as the matching engine sees that there's
    no whitespace following the &quot;Foo&quot; that it had saved in
    <span class="Li">$1</span>, it realizes its mistake and starts over again
    one character after where it had the tentative match. This time it goes all
    the way until the next occurrence of &quot;foo&quot;. The complete regular
    expression matches this time, and you get the expected output of &quot;table
    follows foo.&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes minimal matching can help a lot. Imagine you'd like to
    match everything between &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;. Initially, you
    write something like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $_ =  &quot;The food is under the bar in the barn.&quot;;
    if ( /foo(.*)bar/ ) {
        print &quot;got &lt;$1&gt;\n&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Which perhaps unexpectedly yields:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  got &lt;d is under the bar in the &gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That's because <span class="Li">&quot;.*&quot;</span> was greedy,
    so you get everything between the <i>first</i> &quot;foo&quot; and the
    <i>last</i> &quot;bar&quot;. Here it's more effective to use minimal
    matching to make sure you get the text between a &quot;foo&quot; and the
    first &quot;bar&quot; thereafter.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    if ( /foo(.*?)bar/ ) { print &quot;got &lt;$1&gt;\n&quot; }
  got &lt;d is under the &gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here's another example. Let's say you'd like to match a number at
    the end of a string, and you also want to keep the preceding part of the
    match. So you write this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $_ = &quot;I have 2 numbers: 53147&quot;;
    if ( /(.*)(\d*)/ ) {                                # Wrong!
        print &quot;Beginning is &lt;$1&gt;, number is &lt;$2&gt;.\n&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That won't work at all, because
    <span class="Li">&quot;.*&quot;</span> was greedy and gobbled up the whole
    string. As <span class="Li">&quot;\d*&quot;</span> can match on an empty
    string the complete regular expression matched successfully.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    Beginning is &lt;I have 2 numbers: 53147&gt;, number is &lt;&gt;.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here are some variants, most of which don't work:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $_ = &quot;I have 2 numbers: 53147&quot;;
    @pats = qw{
        (.*)(\d*)
        (.*)(\d+)
        (.*?)(\d*)
        (.*?)(\d+)
        (.*)(\d+)$
        (.*?)(\d+)$
        (.*)\b(\d+)$
        (.*\D)(\d+)$
    };

    for $pat (@pats) {
        printf &quot;%-12s &quot;, $pat;
        if ( /$pat/ ) {
            print &quot;&lt;$1&gt; &lt;$2&gt;\n&quot;;
        } else {
            print &quot;FAIL\n&quot;;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That will print out:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    (.*)(\d*)    &lt;I have 2 numbers: 53147&gt; &lt;&gt;
    (.*)(\d+)    &lt;I have 2 numbers: 5314&gt; &lt;7&gt;
    (.*?)(\d*)   &lt;&gt; &lt;&gt;
    (.*?)(\d+)   &lt;I have &gt; &lt;2&gt;
    (.*)(\d+)$   &lt;I have 2 numbers: 5314&gt; &lt;7&gt;
    (.*?)(\d+)$  &lt;I have 2 numbers: &gt; &lt;53147&gt;
    (.*)\b(\d+)$ &lt;I have 2 numbers: &gt; &lt;53147&gt;
    (.*\D)(\d+)$ &lt;I have 2 numbers: &gt; &lt;53147&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As you see, this can be a bit tricky. It's important to realize
    that a regular expression is merely a set of assertions that gives a
    definition of success. There may be 0, 1, or several different ways that the
    definition might succeed against a particular string. And if there are
    multiple ways it might succeed, you need to understand backtracking to know
    which variety of success you will achieve.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using look-ahead assertions and negations, this can all get
    even trickier. Imagine you'd like to find a sequence of non-digits not
    followed by &quot;123&quot;. You might try to write that as</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $_ = &quot;ABC123&quot;;
    if ( /^\D*(?!123)/ ) {                # Wrong!
        print &quot;Yup, no 123 in $_\n&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But that isn't going to match; at least, not the way you're
    hoping. It claims that there is no 123 in the string. Here's a clearer
    picture of why that pattern matches, contrary to popular expectations:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $x = 'ABC123';
    $y = 'ABC445';

    print &quot;1: got $1\n&quot; if $x =~ /^(ABC)(?!123)/;
    print &quot;2: got $1\n&quot; if $y =~ /^(ABC)(?!123)/;

    print &quot;3: got $1\n&quot; if $x =~ /^(\D*)(?!123)/;
    print &quot;4: got $1\n&quot; if $y =~ /^(\D*)(?!123)/;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This prints</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    2: got ABC
    3: got AB
    4: got ABC
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You might have expected test 3 to fail because it seems to a more
    general purpose version of test 1. The important difference between them is
    that test 3 contains a quantifier (<span class="Li">&quot;\D*&quot;</span>)
    and so can use backtracking, whereas test 1 will not. What's happening is
    that you've asked &quot;Is it true that at the start of
    <span class="Li">$x</span>, following 0 or more non-digits, you have
    something that's not 123?&quot; If the pattern matcher had let
    <span class="Li">&quot;\D*&quot;</span> expand to &quot;ABC&quot;, this
    would have caused the whole pattern to fail.</p>
<p class="Pp">The search engine will initially match
    <span class="Li">&quot;\D*&quot;</span> with &quot;ABC&quot;. Then it will
    try to match <span class="Li">&quot;(?!123)&quot;</span> with
    &quot;123&quot;, which fails. But because a quantifier
    (<span class="Li">&quot;\D*&quot;</span>) has been used in the regular
    expression, the search engine can backtrack and retry the match differently
    in the hope of matching the complete regular expression.</p>
<p class="Pp">The pattern really, <i>really</i> wants to succeed, so it uses the
    standard pattern back-off-and-retry and lets
    <span class="Li">&quot;\D*&quot;</span> expand to just &quot;AB&quot; this
    time. Now there's indeed something following &quot;AB&quot; that is not
    &quot;123&quot;. It's &quot;C123&quot;, which suffices.</p>
<p class="Pp">We can deal with this by using both an assertion and a negation.
    We'll say that the first part in <span class="Li">$1</span> must be followed
    both by a digit and by something that's not &quot;123&quot;. Remember that
    the look-aheads are zero-width expressions--they only look, but don't
    consume any of the string in their match. So rewriting this way produces
    what you'd expect; that is, case 5 will fail, but case 6 succeeds:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    print &quot;5: got $1\n&quot; if $x =~ /^(\D*)(?=\d)(?!123)/;
    print &quot;6: got $1\n&quot; if $y =~ /^(\D*)(?=\d)(?!123)/;

    6: got ABC
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In other words, the two zero-width assertions next to each other
    work as though they're ANDed together, just as you'd use any built-in
    assertions: <span class="Li">&quot;/^$/&quot;</span> matches only if you're
    at the beginning of the line AND the end of the line simultaneously. The
    deeper underlying truth is that juxtaposition in regular expressions always
    means AND, except when you write an explicit OR using the vertical bar.
    <span class="Li">&quot;/ab/&quot;</span> means match &quot;a&quot; AND
    (then) match &quot;b&quot;, although the attempted matches are made at
    different positions because &quot;a&quot; is not a zero-width assertion, but
    a one-width assertion.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>: Particularly complicated regular expressions can
    take exponential time to solve because of the immense number of possible
    ways they can use backtracking to try for a match. For example, without
    internal optimizations done by the regular expression engine, this will take
    a painfully long time to run:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    'aaaaaaaaaaaa' =~ /((a{0,5}){0,5})*[c]/
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And if you used <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>'s in the
    internal groups instead of limiting them to 0 through 5 matches, then it
    would take forever--or until you ran out of stack space. Moreover, these
    internal optimizations are not always applicable. For example, if you put
    <span class="Li">&quot;{0,5}&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> on the external group, no current
    optimization is applicable, and the match takes a long time to finish.</p>
<p class="Pp">A powerful tool for optimizing such beasts is what is known as an
    &quot;independent group&quot;, which does not backtrack (see
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;(?&gt;pattern)&quot;</span>&quot;). Note also
    that zero-length look-ahead/look-behind assertions will not backtrack to
    make the tail match, since they are in &quot;logical&quot; context: only
    whether they match is considered relevant. For an example where side-effects
    of look-ahead <i>might</i> have influenced the following match, see
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;(?&gt;pattern)&quot;</span>&quot;.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Version_8_Regular_Expressions"><a class="permalink" href="#Version_8_Regular_Expressions">Version
  8 Regular Expressions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In case you're not familiar with the &quot;regular&quot; Version 8
    regex routines, here are the pattern-matching rules not described above.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any single character matches itself, unless it is a
    <i>metacharacter</i> with a special meaning described here or above. You can
    cause characters that normally function as metacharacters to be interpreted
    literally by prefixing them with a &quot;\&quot; (e.g., &quot;\.&quot;
    matches a &quot;.&quot;, not any character; &quot;\\&quot; matches a
    &quot;\&quot;). This escape mechanism is also required for the character
    used as the pattern delimiter.</p>
<p class="Pp">A series of characters matches that series of characters in the
    target string, so the pattern <span class="Li">&quot;blurfl&quot;</span>
    would match &quot;blurfl&quot; in the target string.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can specify a character class, by enclosing a list of
    characters in <span class="Li">&quot;[]&quot;</span>, which will match any
    character from the list. If the first character after the &quot;[&quot; is
    &quot;^&quot;, the class matches any character not in the list. Within a
    list, the &quot;-&quot; character specifies a range, so that
    <span class="Li">&quot;a-z&quot;</span> represents all characters between
    &quot;a&quot; and &quot;z&quot;, inclusive. If you want either &quot;-&quot;
    or &quot;]&quot; itself to be a member of a class, put it at the start of
    the list (possibly after a &quot;^&quot;), or escape it with a backslash.
    &quot;-&quot; is also taken literally when it is at the end of the list,
    just before the closing &quot;]&quot;. (The following all specify the same
    class of three characters: <span class="Li">&quot;[-az]&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;[az-]&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;[a\-z]&quot;</span>. All are different from
    <span class="Li">&quot;[a-z]&quot;</span>, which specifies a class
    containing twenty-six characters, even on EBCDIC-based character sets.)
    Also, if you try to use the character classes
    <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\W&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\s&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\S&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\d&quot;</span>, or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\D&quot;</span> as endpoints of a range, the
    &quot;-&quot; is understood literally.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note also that the whole range idea is rather unportable between
    character sets--and even within character sets they may cause results you
    probably didn't expect. A sound principle is to use only ranges that begin
    from and end at either alphabetics of equal case ([a-e], [A-E]), or digits
    ([0-9]). Anything else is unsafe. If in doubt, spell out the character sets
    in full.</p>
<p class="Pp">Characters may be specified using a metacharacter syntax much like
    that used in C: &quot;\n&quot; matches a newline, &quot;\t&quot; a tab,
    &quot;\r&quot; a carriage return, &quot;\f&quot; a form feed, etc. More
    generally, \<i>nnn</i>, where <i>nnn</i> is a string of three octal digits,
    matches the character whose coded character set value is <i>nnn</i>.
    Similarly, \x<i>nn</i>, where <i>nn</i> are hexadecimal digits, matches the
    character whose ordinal is <i>nn</i>. The expression \c<i>x</i> matches the
    character control-<i>x</i>. Finally, the &quot;.&quot; metacharacter matches
    any character except &quot;\n&quot; (unless you use
    <span class="Li">&quot;/s&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">You can specify a series of alternatives for a pattern using
    &quot;|&quot; to separate them, so that
    <span class="Li">&quot;fee|fie|foe&quot;</span> will match any of
    &quot;fee&quot;, &quot;fie&quot;, or &quot;foe&quot; in the target string
    (as would <span class="Li">&quot;f(e|i|o)e&quot;</span>). The first
    alternative includes everything from the last pattern delimiter
    (&quot;(&quot;, &quot;(?:&quot;, etc. or the beginning of the pattern) up to
    the first &quot;|&quot;, and the last alternative contains everything from
    the last &quot;|&quot; to the next closing pattern delimiter. That's why
    it's common practice to include alternatives in parentheses: to minimize
    confusion about where they start and end.</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternatives are tried from left to right, so the first
    alternative found for which the entire expression matches, is the one that
    is chosen. This means that alternatives are not necessarily greedy. For
    example: when matching <span class="Li">&quot;foo|foot&quot;</span> against
    &quot;barefoot&quot;, only the &quot;foo&quot; part will match, as that is
    the first alternative tried, and it successfully matches the target string.
    (This might not seem important, but it is important when you are capturing
    matched text using parentheses.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Also remember that &quot;|&quot; is interpreted as a literal
    within square brackets, so if you write
    <span class="Li">&quot;[fee|fie|foe]&quot;</span> you're really only
    matching <span class="Li">&quot;[feio|]&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Within a pattern, you may designate subpatterns for later
    reference by enclosing them in parentheses, and you may refer back to the
    <i>n</i>th subpattern later in the pattern using the metacharacter \<i>n</i>
    or \g<i>n</i>. Subpatterns are numbered based on the left to right order of
    their opening parenthesis. A backreference matches whatever actually matched
    the subpattern in the string being examined, not the rules for that
    subpattern. Therefore, <span class="Li">&quot;(0|0x)\d*\s\g1\d*&quot;</span>
    will match &quot;0x1234 0x4321&quot;, but not &quot;0x1234 01234&quot;,
    because subpattern 1 matched &quot;0x&quot;, even though the rule
    <span class="Li">&quot;0|0x&quot;</span> could potentially match the leading
    0 in the second number.</p>

<p class="Pp">Some people get too used to writing things like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $pattern =~ s/(\W)/\\\1/g;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is grandfathered (for \1 to \9) for the RHS of a substitute
    to avoid shocking the <b>sed</b> addicts, but it's a dirty habit to get
    into. That's because in PerlThink, the righthand side of an
    <span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span> is a double-quoted string.
    <span class="Li">&quot;\1&quot;</span> in the usual double-quoted string
    means a control-A. The customary Unix meaning of
    <span class="Li">&quot;\1&quot;</span> is kludged in for
    <span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span>. However, if you get into the habit

<h2 class="Ss" id="Repeated_Patterns_Matching_a_Zero-length_Substring"><a class="permalink" href="#Repeated_Patterns_Matching_a_Zero-length_Substring">Repeated
  Patterns Matching a Zero-length Substring</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><b>WARNING</b>: Difficult material (and prose) ahead. This section
    needs a rewrite.</p>
<p class="Pp">Regular expressions provide a terse and powerful programming
    language. As with most other power tools, power comes together with the
    ability to wreak havoc.</p>
<p class="Pp">A common abuse of this power stems from the ability to make
    infinite loops using regular expressions, with something as innocuous
  as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    'foo' =~ m{ ( o? )* }x;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;o?&quot;</span> matches at the
    beginning of <span class="Li">'foo'</span>, and since the position in the
    string is not moved by the match, <span class="Li">&quot;o?&quot;</span>
    would match again and again because of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> quantifier. Another common way to
    create a similar cycle is with the looping modifier
    <span class="Li">&quot;//g&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @matches = ( 'foo' =~ m{ o? }xg );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    print &quot;match: &lt;$&amp;&gt;\n&quot; while 'foo' =~ m{ o? }xg;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or the loop implied by <i>split()</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, long experience has shown that many programming tasks may
    be significantly simplified by using repeated subexpressions that may match
    zero-length substrings. Here's a simple example being:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @chars = split //, $string;           # // is not magic in split
    ($whitewashed = $string) =~ s/()/ /g; # parens avoid magic s// /
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Thus Perl allows such constructs, by <i>forcefully breaking</i>
    <i>the infinite loop</i>. The rules for this are different for lower-level
    loops given by the greedy quantifiers
    <span class="Li">&quot;*+{}&quot;</span>, and for higher-level ones like the
    <span class="Li">&quot;/g&quot;</span> modifier or <i>split()</i>
  operator.</p>
<p class="Pp">The lower-level loops are <i>interrupted</i> (that is, the loop is
    broken) when Perl detects that a repeated expression matched a zero-length
    substring. Thus</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   m{ (?: NON_ZERO_LENGTH | ZERO_LENGTH )* }x;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">is made equivalent to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   m{ (?: NON_ZERO_LENGTH )* (?: ZERO_LENGTH )? }x;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">For example, this program</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   #!perl -l
   &quot;aaaaab&quot; =~ /

        a                 # non-zero
        |                 # or
       (?{print &quot;hello&quot;}) # print hello whenever this
                          #    branch is tried

   print $1;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">prints</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   hello
   aaaaa
   b
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Notice that &quot;hello&quot; is only printed once, as when Perl
    sees that the sixth iteration of the outermost
    <span class="Li">&quot;(?:)*&quot;</span> matches a zero-length string, it
    stops the <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The higher-level loops preserve an additional state between
    iterations: whether the last match was zero-length. To break the loop, the
    following match after a zero-length match is prohibited to have a length of
    zero. This prohibition interacts with backtracking (see
    &quot;Backtracking&quot;), and so the <i>second best</i> match is chosen if
    the <i>best</i> match is of zero length.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $_ = 'bar';
    s/\w??/&lt;$&amp;&gt;/g;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">results in
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;r&gt;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span>.
    At each position of the string the best match given by non-greedy
    <span class="Li">&quot;??&quot;</span> is the zero-length match, and the
    <i>second</i> <i>best</i> match is what is matched by
    <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span>. Thus zero-length matches alternate
    with one-character-long matches.</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, for repeated <span class="Li">&quot;m/()/g&quot;</span>
    the second-best match is the match at the position one notch further in the
    string.</p>
<p class="Pp">The additional state of being <i>matched with zero-length</i> is
    associated with the matched string, and is reset by each assignment to
    <i>pos()</i>. Zero-length matches at the end of the previous match are
    ignored during <span class="Li">&quot;split&quot;</span>.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Combining_"><a class="permalink" href="#Combining_">Combining
  RE Pieces</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Each of the elementary pieces of regular expressions which were
    described before (such as <span class="Li">&quot;ab&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;\Z&quot;</span>) could match at most one substring at
    the given position of the input string. However, in a typical regular
    expression these elementary pieces are combined into more complicated
    patterns using combining operators <span class="Li">&quot;ST&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;S|T&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;S*&quot;</span> etc. (in these examples
    <span class="Li">&quot;S&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;T&quot;</span> are regular subexpressions).</p>
<p class="Pp">Such combinations can include alternatives, leading to a problem
    of choice: if we match a regular expression
    <span class="Li">&quot;a|ab&quot;</span> against
    <span class="Li">&quot;abc&quot;</span>, will it match substring
    <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;ab&quot;</span>? One way to describe which substring
    is actually matched is the concept of backtracking (see
    &quot;Backtracking&quot;). However, this description is too low-level and
    makes you think in terms of a particular implementation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another description starts with notions of
    &quot;better&quot;/&quot;worse&quot;. All the substrings which may be
    matched by the given regular expression can be sorted from the
    &quot;best&quot; match to the &quot;worst&quot; match, and it is the
    &quot;best&quot; match which is chosen. This substitutes the question of
    &quot;what is chosen?&quot; by the question of &quot;which matches are
    better, and which are worse?&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Again, for elementary pieces there is no such question, since at
    most one match at a given position is possible. This section describes the
    notion of better/worse for combining operators. In the description below
    <span class="Li">&quot;S&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;T&quot;</span> are regular subexpressions.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;ST&quot;</dt>

      <span class="Li">&quot;A'&quot;</span> are substrings which can be matched
      by <span class="Li">&quot;S&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;B&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;B'&quot;</span> are substrings which can be matched
      by <span class="Li">&quot;T&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;A&quot;</span> is a better match for

        <span class="Li">&quot;A'&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;AB&quot;</span> is a better match than
        <span class="Li">&quot;A'B'&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;A&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;A'&quot;</span> coincide:
        <span class="Li">&quot;AB&quot;</span> is a better match than
        <span class="Li">&quot;AB'&quot;</span> if
        <span class="Li">&quot;B&quot;</span> is a better match for

  <dd>When <span class="Li">&quot;S&quot;</span> can match, it is a better match

    <p class="Pp">Ordering of two matches for

<p class="Pp">The above recipes describe the ordering of matches <i>at a given

<h2 class="Ss" id="Creating_Custom_"><a class="permalink" href="#Creating_Custom_">Creating
  Custom RE Engines</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.10.0, one can create custom regular expression
    engines. This is not for the faint of heart, as they have to plug in at the
    C level. See perlreapi for more details.</p>
<p class="Pp">As an alternative, overloaded constants (see overload) provide a
    simple way to extend the functionality of the RE engine, by substituting one
    pattern for another.</p>
<p class="Pp">Suppose that we want to enable a new RE escape-sequence
    <span class="Li">&quot;\Y|&quot;</span> which matches at a boundary between
    whitespace characters and non-whitespace characters. Note that
    <span class="Li">&quot;(?=\S)(?&lt;!\S)|(?!\S)(?&lt;=\S)&quot;</span>
    matches exactly at these positions, so we want to have each
    <span class="Li">&quot;\Y|&quot;</span> in the place of the more complicated
    version. We can create a module <span class="Li">&quot;customre&quot;</span>
    to do this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    package customre;
    use overload;

    sub import {
      shift;
      die &quot;No argument to customre::import allowed&quot; if @_;
      overload::constant 'qr' =&gt; \&amp;convert;
    }

    sub invalid { die &quot;/$_[0]/: invalid escape '\\$_[1]'&quot;}

    # We must also take care of not escaping the legitimate \\Y|
    # sequence, hence the presence of '\\' in the conversion rules.
    my %rules = ( '\\' =&gt; '\\\\',
                  'Y|' =&gt; qr/(?=\S)(?&lt;!\S)|(?!\S)(?&lt;=\S)/ );
    sub convert {
      my $re = shift;
      $re =~ s{
                \\ ( \\ | Y . )
              }
              { $rules{$1} or invalid($re,$1) }sgex;
      return $re;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now <span class="Li">&quot;use customre&quot;</span> enables the
    new escape in constant regular expressions, i.e., those without any runtime
    variable interpolations. As documented in overload, this conversion will
    work only over literal parts of regular expressions. For
    <span class="Li">&quot;\Y|$re\Y|&quot;</span> the variable part of this
    regular expression needs to be converted explicitly (but only if the special
    meaning of <span class="Li">&quot;\Y|&quot;</span> should be enabled inside
    <span class="Li">$re</span>):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use customre;
    $re = &lt;&gt;;
    chomp $re;
    $re = customre::convert $re;
    /\Y|$re\Y|/;
</pre>
