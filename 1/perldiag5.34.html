<p class="Pp">These messages are classified as follows (listed in increasing
    order of desperation):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    (W) A warning (optional).
    (D) A deprecation (enabled by default).
    (S) A severe warning (enabled by default).
    (F) A fatal error (trappable).
    (P) An internal error you should never see (trappable).
    (X) A very fatal error (nontrappable).
    (A) An alien error message (not generated by Perl).
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The majority of messages from the first three classifications
    above (W, D &amp; S) can be controlled using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a message can be controlled by the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma, its warning category is
    included with the classification letter in the description below. E.g.
    <span class="Li">&quot;(W closed)&quot;</span> means a warning in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;closed&quot;</span> category.</p>
<p class="Pp">Optional warnings are enabled by using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma or the <b>-w</b> and
    <b>-W</b> switches. Warnings may be captured by setting
    <span class="Li">$SIG{__WARN__}</span> to a reference to a routine that will
    be called on each warning instead of printing it. See perlvar.</p>
<p class="Pp">Severe warnings are always enabled, unless they are explicitly
    disabled with the <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma or the
    <b>-X</b> switch.</p>
<p class="Pp">Trappable errors may be trapped using the eval operator. See
    &quot;eval&quot; in perlfunc. In almost all cases, warnings may be
    selectively disabled or promoted to fatal errors using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;warnings&quot;</span> pragma. See warnings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The messages are in alphabetical order, without regard to upper or
    lower-case. Some of these messages are generic. Spots that vary are denoted
    with a <span class="Li">%s</span> or other printf-style escape. These
    escapes are ignored by the alphabetical order, as are all characters other
    than letters. To look up your message, just ignore anything that is not a
    letter.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="accept()"><a class="permalink" href="#accept()"><b>accept()</b> on
    closed socket %s</a></dt>
  <dd>(W closed) You tried to do an accept on a closed socket. Did you forget to
      check the return value of your <b>socket()</b> call? See
      &quot;accept&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt id="Aliasing"><a class="permalink" href="#Aliasing">Aliasing via reference
    is experimental</a></dt>
  <dd>(S experimental::refaliasing) This warning is emitted if you use a
      reference constructor on the left-hand side of an assignment to alias one
      variable to another. Simply suppress the warning if you want to use the
      feature, but know that in doing so you are taking the risk of using an
      experimental feature which may change or be removed in a future Perl
      version:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    no warnings &quot;experimental::refaliasing&quot;;
    use feature &quot;refaliasing&quot;;
    \$x = \$y;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Allocation"><a class="permalink" href="#Allocation">Allocation too
    large: %x</a></dt>
  <dd>(X) You can't allocate more than 64K on an MS-DOS machine.</dd>
  <dt>'%c' allowed only after types %s in %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) The modifiers '!', '&lt;' and '&gt;' are allowed in <b>pack()</b> or
      <b>unpack()</b> only after certain types. See &quot;pack&quot; in
      perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt id="alpha"><a class="permalink" href="#alpha">alpha-&gt;<b>numify()</b> is
    lossy</a></dt>
  <dd>(W numeric) An alpha version can not be numified without losing
      information.</dd>
  <dt id="Ambiguous"><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous">Ambiguous call
    resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</a></dt>
  <dd>(W ambiguous) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl
      keyword, and you have used the name without qualification for calling one
      or the other. Perl decided to call the builtin because the subroutine is
      not imported.
    <p class="Pp">To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an
        ampersand before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its
        package. Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that
        it's imported with the <span class="Li">&quot;use subs&quot;</span>
        pragma).</p>
    <p class="Pp">To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::&quot;</span> prefix on the operator (e.g.
        <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::log($x)&quot;</span>) or declare the
        subroutine to be an object method (see &quot;Subroutine Attributes&quot;
        in perlsub or attributes).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Ambiguous~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous~2">Ambiguous range
    in transliteration operator</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) You wrote something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr/a-z-0//&quot;</span> which doesn't mean anything
      at all. To include a <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span> character in a
      transliteration, put it either first or last. (In the past,
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr/a-z-0//&quot;</span> was synonymous with
      <span class="Li">&quot;tr/a-y//&quot;</span>, which was probably not what
      you would have expected.)</dd>
  <dt id="Ambiguous~3"><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous~3">Ambiguous use of
    %s resolved as %s</a></dt>
  <dd>(S ambiguous) You said something that may not be interpreted the way you
      thought. Normally it's pretty easy to disambiguate it by supplying a
      missing quote, operator, parenthesis pair or declaration.</dd>
  <dt id="Ambiguous~4"><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous~4">Ambiguous use of
    -%s resolved as -&amp;%s()</a></dt>
  <dd>(S ambiguous) You wrote something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;-foo&quot;</span>, which might be the string
      <span class="Li">&quot;-foo&quot;</span>, or a call to the function
      <span class="Li">&quot;foo&quot;</span>, negated. If you meant the string,
      just write <span class="Li">&quot;-foo&quot;</span>. If you meant the
      function call, write <span class="Li">&quot;-foo()&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt id="Ambiguous~5"><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous~5">Ambiguous use of
    %c resolved as operator %c</a></dt>
  <dd>(S ambiguous) <span class="Li">&quot;%&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> are both infix operators (modulus,
      bitwise and, and multiplication) <i>and</i> initial special characters
      (denoting hashes, subroutines and typeglobs), and you said something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;*foo * foo&quot;</span> that might be interpreted
      as either of them. We assumed you meant the infix operator, but please try
      to make it more clear -- in the example given, you might write
      <span class="Li">&quot;*foo * foo()&quot;</span> if you really meant to
      multiply a glob by the result of calling a function.</dd>
  <dt id="Ambiguous~6"><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous~6">Ambiguous use of
    %c{%s} resolved to %c%s</a></dt>
  <dd>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;@{foo}&quot;</span>, which might be asking for the
      variable <span class="Li">@foo</span>, or it might be calling a function
      named foo, and dereferencing it as an array reference. If you wanted the
      variable, you can just write <span class="Li">@foo</span>. If you wanted
      to call the function, write <span class="Li">&quot;@{foo()}&quot;</span>
      ... or you could just not have a variable and a function with the same
      name, and save yourself a lot of trouble.</dd>
  <dt id="Ambiguous~7"><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous~7">Ambiguous use of
    %c{%s[...]} resolved to %c%s[...]</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt id="Ambiguous~8"><a class="permalink" href="#Ambiguous~8">Ambiguous use of
    %c{%s{...}} resolved to %c%s{...}</a></dt>
  <dd>(W ambiguous) You wrote something like
      <span class="Li">&quot;${foo[2]}&quot;</span> (where foo represents the
      name of a Perl keyword), which might be looking for element number 2 of
      the array named <span class="Li">@foo</span>, in which case please write
      <span class="Li">$foo[2]</span>, or you might have meant to pass an
      anonymous arrayref to the function named foo, and then do a scalar deref
      on the value it returns. If you meant that, write
      <span class="Li">&quot;${foo([2])}&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">In regular expressions, the
        <span class="Li">&quot;${foo[2]}&quot;</span> syntax is sometimes
        necessary to disambiguate between array subscripts and character
        classes. <span class="Li">&quot;/$length[2345]/&quot;</span>, for
        instance, will be interpreted as <span class="Li">$length</span>
        followed by the character class
        <span class="Li">&quot;[2345]&quot;</span>. If an array subscript is
        what you want, you can avoid the warning by changing
        <span class="Li">&quot;/${length[2345]}/&quot;</span> to the unsightly
        <span class="Li">&quot;/${\$length[2345]}/&quot;</span>, by renaming
        your array to something that does not coincide with a built-in keyword,
        or by simply turning off warnings with <span class="Li">&quot;no
        warnings 'ambiguous';&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>'|' and '&lt;' may not both be specified on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection,
      and found that STDIN was a pipe, and that you also tried to redirect STDIN
      using '&lt;'. Only one STDIN stream to a customer, please.</dd>
  <dt>'|' and '&gt;' may not both be specified on command line</dt>
  <dd>(F) An error peculiar to VMS. Perl does its own command line redirection,
      and thinks you tried to redirect stdout both to a file and into a pipe to
      another command. You need to choose one or the other, though nothing's
      stopping you from piping into a program or Perl script which 'splits'
      output into two streams, such as
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    open(OUT,&quot;&gt;$ARGV[0]&quot;) or die &quot;Can't write to $ARGV[0]: $!&quot;;
    while (&lt;STDIN&gt;) {
        print;
        print OUT;
    }
    close OUT;
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Applying"><a class="permalink" href="#Applying">Applying %s to %s will
    act on scalar(%s)</a></dt>
  <dd>(W misc) The pattern match (<span class="Li">&quot;//&quot;</span>),
      substitution (<span class="Li">&quot;s///&quot;</span>), and
      transliteration (<span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span>) operators work
      on scalar values. If you apply one of them to an array or a hash, it will
      convert the array or hash to a scalar value (the length of an array, or
      the population info of a hash) and then work on that scalar value. This is
      probably not what you meant to do. See &quot;grep&quot; in perlfunc and
      &quot;map&quot; in perlfunc for alternatives.</dd>
  <dt id="Arg"><a class="permalink" href="#Arg">Arg too short for
    msgsnd</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) <b>msgsnd()</b> requires a string at least as long as
    sizeof(long).</dd>
  <dt id="Argument"><a class="permalink" href="#Argument">Argument
    &quot;%s&quot; isn't numeric%s</a></dt>
  <dd>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to an operator
      that expected a numeric value instead. If you're fortunate the message
      will identify which operator was so unfortunate.
    <p class="Pp">Note that for the <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span> (infinity and not-a-number) the
        definition of &quot;numeric&quot; is somewhat unusual: the strings
        themselves (like &quot;Inf&quot;) are considered numeric, and anything
        following them is considered non-numeric.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Argument~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Argument~2">Argument list not
    closed for PerlIO layer &quot;%s&quot;</a></dt>
  <dd>(W layer) When pushing a layer with arguments onto the Perl I/O system you
      forgot the ) that closes the argument list. (Layers take care of
      transforming data between external and internal representations.) Perl
      stopped parsing the layer list at this point and did not attempt to push
      this layer. If your program didn't explicitly request the failing
      operation, it may be the result of the value of the environment variable
      PERLIO.</dd>
  <dt id="Argument~3"><a class="permalink" href="#Argument~3">Argument
    &quot;%s&quot; treated as 0 in increment (++)</a></dt>
  <dd>(W numeric) The indicated string was fed as an argument to the
      <span class="Li">&quot;++&quot;</span> operator which expects either a
      number or a string matching
      <span class="Li">&quot;/^[a-zA-Z]*[0-9]*\z/&quot;</span>. See
      &quot;Auto-increment and Auto-decrement&quot; in perlop for details.</dd>
  <dt id="Array"><a class="permalink" href="#Array">Array passed to stat will be
    coerced to a scalar%s</a></dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) You called <b>stat()</b> on an array, but the array will be
      coerced to a scalar - the number of elements in the array.</dd>
  <dt id="A"><a class="permalink" href="#A">A signature parameter must start
    with '$', '@' or '%'</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) Each subroutine signature parameter declaration must start with a
      valid sigil; for example:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub foo ($a, $, $b = 1, @c) {}
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="A~2"><a class="permalink" href="#A~2">A slurpy parameter may not have
    a default value</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) Only scalar subroutine signature parameters may have a default value;
      for example:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub foo ($a = 1)        {} # legal
    sub foo (@a = (1))      {} # invalid
    sub foo (%a = (a =&gt; b)) {} # invalid
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="assertion"><a class="permalink" href="#assertion">assertion botched:
    %s</a></dt>
  <dd>(X) The malloc package that comes with Perl had an internal failure.</dd>
  <dt id="Assertion"><a class="permalink" href="#Assertion">Assertion %s failed:
    file &quot;%s&quot;, line %d</a></dt>
  <dd>(X) A general assertion failed. The file in question must be
    examined.</dd>
  <dt id="Assigned"><a class="permalink" href="#Assigned">Assigned value is not
    a reference</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to assign something that was not a reference to an lvalue
      reference (e.g., <span class="Li">&quot;\$x = $y&quot;</span>). If you
      meant to make <span class="Li">$x</span> an alias to
      <span class="Li">$y</span>, use <span class="Li">&quot;\$x =
      \$y&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt id="Assigned~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Assigned~2">Assigned value is
    not %s reference</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to assign a reference to a reference constructor, but the
      two references were not of the same type. You cannot alias a scalar to an
      array, or an array to a hash; the two types must match.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    \$x = \@y;  # error
    \@x = \%y;  # error
     $y = [];
    \$x = $y;   # error; did you mean \$y?
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Assigning"><a class="permalink" href="#Assigning">Assigning non-zero
    to $[ is no longer possible</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) When the &quot;array_base&quot; feature is disabled (e.g., and under
      <span class="Li">&quot;use v5.16;&quot;</span>, and as of Perl 5.30) the
      special variable <span class="Li">$[</span>, which is deprecated, is now a
      fixed zero value.</dd>
  <dt id="Assignment"><a class="permalink" href="#Assignment">Assignment to both
    a list and a scalar</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) If you assign to a conditional operator, the 2nd and 3rd arguments
      must either both be scalars or both be lists. Otherwise Perl won't know
      which context to supply to the right side.</dd>
  <dt id="Assuming"><a class="permalink" href="#Assuming">Assuming NOT a POSIX
    class since %s in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</a></dt>
  <dd>(W regexp) You had something like these:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> [[:alnum]]
 [[:digit:xyz]
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">They look like they might have been meant to be the POSIX
        classes <span class="Li">&quot;[:alnum:]&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;[:digit:]&quot;</span>. If so, they should be
        written:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> [[:alnum:]]
 [[:digit:]xyz]
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Since these aren't legal POSIX class specifications, but are
        legal bracketed character classes, Perl treats them as the latter. In
        the first example, it matches the characters
        <span class="Li">&quot;:&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;[&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>,

  <dt id="Attempt~4"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~4">Attempt to clear

  <dd>(S debugging) An array was assigned to when it was being freed. Freed

  <dt id="Attempt~8"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~8">Attempt to free

  <dt id="Attempt~9"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~9">Attempt to free temp

  <dd>(S debugging) Mortalized values are supposed to be freed by the

      the SV before the <b>free_tmps()</b> routine gets a chance, which means
      that the <b>free_tmps()</b> routine will be freeing an unreferenced scalar
      when it does try to free it.</dd>

  <dt id="Attempt~11"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt~11">Attempt to free
    unreferenced scalar: SV 0x%x</a></dt>
  <dd>(S internal) Perl went to decrement the reference count of a scalar to see
      if it would go to 0, and discovered that it had already gone to 0 earlier,
      and should have been freed, and in fact, probably was freed. This could
      indicate that <b>SvREFCNT_dec()</b> was called too many times, or that
      <b>SvREFCNT_inc()</b> was called too few times, or that the SV was

  <dd>(S) A warning peculiar to VMS. This arises because of the difference
      between access checks under VMS and under the Unix model Perl assumes.
      Under VMS, access checks are done by filename, rather than by bits in the
      stat buffer, so that ACLs and other protections can be taken into account.
      Unfortunately, Perl assumes that the stat buffer contains all the
      necessary information, and passes it, instead of the filespec, to the
      access-checking routine. It will try to retrieve the filespec using the
      device name and FID present in the stat buffer, but this works only if you
      haven't made a subsequent call to the CRTL <b>stat()</b> routine, because
      the device name is overwritten with each call. If this warning appears,
      the name lookup failed, and the access-checking routine gave up and
      returned FALSE, just to be conservative. (Note: The access-checking
      routine knows about the Perl <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span>
      operator and file tests, so you shouldn't ever see this warning in

  <dd>(D deprecated) You used a declaration similar to <span class="Li">&quot;my
      $x if 0&quot;</span>. There has been a long-standing bug in Perl that
      causes a lexical variable not to be cleared at scope exit when its
      declaration includes a false conditional. Some people have exploited this
      bug to achieve a kind of static variable. Since we intend to fix this bug,
      we don't want people relying on this behavior. You can achieve a similar
      static effect by declaring the variable in a separate block outside the
      function, eg
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub f { my $x if 0; return $x++ }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">becomes</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    { my $x; sub f { return $x++ } }

  <dt id="Locale"><a class="permalink" href="#Locale">Locale '%s' contains (at
    least) the following characters which have unexpected meanings: %s The Perl
    program will use the expected meanings</a></dt>
  <dd>(W locale) You are using the named UTF-8 locale. UTF-8 locales are
      expected to have very particular behavior, which most do. This message
      arises when perl found some departures from the expectations, and is
      notifying you that the expected behavior overrides these differences. In
      some cases the differences are caused by the locale definition being
      defective, but the most common causes of this warning are when there are
      ambiguities and conflicts in following the Standard, and the locale has
      chosen an approach that differs from Perl's.
    <p class="Pp">One of these is because that, contrary to the claims, Unicode
        is not completely locale insensitive. Turkish and some related languages
        have two types of <span class="Li">&quot;I&quot;</span> characters. One
        is dotted in both upper- and lowercase, and the other is dotless in both
        cases. Unicode allows a locale to use either the Turkish rules, or the
        rules used in all other instances, where there is only one type of
        <span class="Li">&quot;I&quot;</span>, which is dotless in the
        uppercase, and dotted in the lower. The perl core does not (yet) handle
        the Turkish case, and this message warns you of that. Instead, the
        Unicode::Casing module allows you to mostly implement the Turkish casing
        rules.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The other common cause is for the characters</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> $ + &lt; = &gt; ^ ` | ~
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">These are problematic. The C standard says that these should
        be considered punctuation in the C locale (and the POSIX standard defers
        to the C standard), and Unicode is generally considered a superset of
        the C locale. But Unicode has added an extra category,
        &quot;Symbol&quot;, and classifies these particular characters as being
        symbols. Most UTF-8 locales have them treated as punctuation, so that
        <b>ispunct</b>(2) returns non-zero for them. But a few locales have it
        return 0. Perl takes the first approach, not using
        <span class="Li">&quot;ispunct()&quot;</span> at all (see Note [5] in
        perlrecharclass), and this message is raised to notify you that you are
        getting Perl's approach, not the locale's.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Locale~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Locale~2">Locale '%s' may not

  <dd>(W locale) You are using the named locale, which is a non-UTF-8 one, and
      which perl has determined is not fully compatible with what it can handle.
      The second <span class="Li">%s</span> gives a reason.
    <p class="Pp">By far the most common reason is that the locale has
        characters in it that are represented by more than one byte. The only
        such locales that Perl can handle are the UTF-8 locales. Most likely the
        specified locale is a non-UTF-8 one for an East Asian language such as
        Chinese or Japanese. If the locale is a superset of ASCII, the ASCII
        portion of it may work in Perl.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Some essentially obsolete locales that aren't supersets of
        ASCII, mainly those in ISO 646 or other 7-bit locales, such as ASMO 449,
        can also have problems, depending on what portions of the ASCII
        character set get changed by the locale and are also used by the
        program. The warning message lists the determinable conflicting
        characters.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that not all incompatibilities are found.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this happens to you, there's not much you can do except
        switch to use a different locale or use Encode to translate from the
        locale into UTF-8; if that's impracticable, you have been warned that
        some things may break.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This message is output once each time a bad locale is switched
        into within the scope of
        <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span>, or on the first

  <dt id="Matched"><a class="permalink" href="#Matched">Matched non-Unicode code
    point 0x%X against Unicode property; may not be portable</a></dt>
  <dd>(S non_unicode) Perl allows strings to contain a superset of Unicode code
      points; each code point may be as large as what is storable in a signed
      integer on your system, but these may not be accepted by other
      languages/systems. This message occurs when you matched a string
      containing such a code point against a regular expression pattern, and the
      code point was matched against a Unicode property,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\p{...}&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;\P{...}&quot;</span>. Unicode properties are only
      defined on Unicode code points, so the result of this match is undefined
      by Unicode, but Perl (starting in v5.20) treats non-Unicode code points as
      if they were typical unassigned Unicode ones, and matched this one
      accordingly. Whether a given property matches these code points or not is
      specified in &quot;Properties accessible through \p{} and \P{}&quot; in
      perluniprops.
    <p class="Pp">This message is suppressed (unless it has been made fatal) if
        it is immaterial to the results of the match if the code point is
        Unicode or not. For example, the property
        <span class="Li">&quot;\p{ASCII_Hex_Digit}&quot;</span> only can match
        the 22 characters <span class="Li">&quot;[0-9A-Fa-f]&quot;</span>, so
        obviously all other code points, Unicode or not, won't match it. (And
        <span class="Li">&quot;\P{ASCII_Hex_Digit}&quot;</span> will match every
        code point except these 22.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Getting this message indicates that the outcome of the match
        arguably should have been the opposite of what actually happened. If you
        think that is the case, you may wish to make the
        <span class="Li">&quot;non_unicode&quot;</span> warnings category fatal;
        if you agree with Perl's decision, you may wish to turn off this

  <dd>(F) <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> has two meanings.
    <p class="Pp">The traditional one has it followed by a name enclosed in
        braces, meaning the character (or sequence of characters) given by that
        name. Thus <span class="Li">&quot;\N{ASTERISK}&quot;</span> is another
        way of writing <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>, valid in both
        double-quoted strings and regular expression patterns. In patterns, it
        doesn't have the meaning an unescaped
        <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> does.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Starting in Perl 5.12.0,
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> also can have an additional
        meaning (only) in patterns, namely to match a non-newline character.
        (This is short for <span class="Li">&quot;[^\n]&quot;</span>, and like
        <span class="Li">&quot;.&quot;</span> but is not affected by the
        <span class="Li">&quot;/s&quot;</span> regex modifier.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">This can lead to some ambiguities. When
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N&quot;</span> is not followed immediately by a
        left brace, Perl assumes the <span class="Li">&quot;[^\n]&quot;</span>
        meaning. Also, if the braces form a valid quantifier such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{3}&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{5,}&quot;</span>, Perl assumes that this means
        to match the given quantity of non-newlines (in these examples, 3; and 5
        or more, respectively). In all other case, where there is a
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{&quot;</span> and a matching
        <span class="Li">&quot;}&quot;</span>, Perl assumes that a character
        name is desired.</p>
    <p class="Pp">However, if there is no matching
        <span class="Li">&quot;}&quot;</span>, Perl doesn't know if it was
        mistakenly omitted, or if <span class="Li">&quot;[^\n]{&quot;</span> was
        desired, and raises this error. If you meant the former, add the right
        brace; if you meant the latter, escape the brace with a backslash, like
        so: <span class="Li">&quot;\N\{&quot;</span></p>

  <dt id="Number"><a class="permalink" href="#Number">Number too long</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl limits the representation of decimal numbers in programs to about
      250 characters. You've exceeded that length. Future versions of Perl are
      likely to eliminate this arbitrary limitation. In the meantime, try using
      scientific notation (e.g. &quot;1e6&quot; instead of
      &quot;1_000_000&quot;).</dd>
  <dt id="Number~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Number~2">Number with no
    digits</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl was looking for a number but found nothing that looked like a

  <dd>(F) The only numeric variable which is allowed to start with a 0 is
      <span class="Li">$0</span>, and you mentioned a variable that starts with
      0 that has more than one digit. You probably want to remove the leading 0,

  <dt id="Odd"><a class="permalink" href="#Odd">Odd name/value argument for

  <dd>(F) A subroutine using a slurpy hash parameter in its signature received
      an odd number of arguments to populate the hash. It requires the arguments

  <dd>(F)(W layer) You tried to do a read/write/send/recv/seek operation with an

  <dd>(S non_unicode) You performed an operation requiring Unicode rules on a

  <dd>(S ambiguous) You used a variable or subroutine call where the parser was
      expecting an operator. The parser has assumed you really meant to use an

  <dd>(F) In a subroutine signature, you wrote something like &quot;$a =&quot;,
      making a named optional parameter without a default value. A nameless

  <dt id="Subroutine"><a class="permalink" href="#Subroutine">Subroutine

  <dd>(F) When subroutine signatures are enabled, any subroutine attributes must
      come before the signature. Note that this order was the opposite in

  <dt id="Subroutine~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Subroutine~2">Subroutine
    &quot;&amp;%s&quot; is not available</a></dt>
  <dd>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
      attempting to capture an outer lexical subroutine that is not currently
      available. This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the lexical
      subroutine may be declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not
      yet been created. (Remember that named subs are created at compile time,
      while anonymous subs are created at run-time.) For example,
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub { my sub a {...} sub f { \&amp;a } }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current
        &quot;a&quot; sub, since the anonymous subroutine hasn't been created
        yet. Conversely, the following won't give a warning since the anonymous
        subroutine has by now been created and is live:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub { my sub a {...} eval 'sub f { \&amp;a }' }-&gt;();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a lexical
        subroutine that has gone out of scope, for example,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub f {
        my sub a {...}
        sub { eval '\&amp;a' }
    }
    f()-&gt;();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Here, when the '\&amp;a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is
        not currently being executed, so its &amp;a is not available for
        capture.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;%s&quot; subroutine &amp;%s masks earlier declaration in same
    %s</dt>
  <dd>(W shadow) A &quot;my&quot; or &quot;state&quot; subroutine has been
      redeclared in the current scope or statement, effectively eliminating all
      access to the previous instance. This is almost always a typographical
      error. Note that the earlier subroutine will still exist until the end of
      the scope or until all closure references to it are destroyed.</dd>
  <dt id="Subroutine~3"><a class="permalink" href="#Subroutine~3">Subroutine %s
    redefined</a></dt>
  <dd>(W redefine) You redefined a subroutine. To suppress this warning, say
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    {
        no warnings 'redefine';
        eval &quot;sub name { ... }&quot;;
    }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Subroutine~4"><a class="permalink" href="#Subroutine~4">Subroutine
    &quot;%s&quot; will not stay shared</a></dt>
  <dd>(W closure) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a
      &quot;my&quot; subroutine defined in an outer named subroutine.
    <p class="Pp">When the inner subroutine is called, it will see the value of
        the outer subroutine's lexical subroutine as it was before and during
        the *first* call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first
        call to the outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer
        subroutines will no longer share a common value for the lexical
        subroutine. In other words, it will no longer be shared. This will
        especially make a difference if the lexical subroutines accesses lexical
        variables declared in its surrounding scope.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This problem can usually be solved by making the inner
        subroutine anonymous, using the <span class="Li">&quot;sub
        {}&quot;</span> syntax. When inner anonymous subs that reference lexical
        subroutines in outer subroutines are created, they are automatically

  <dd>(F) You used a declaration similar to <span class="Li">&quot;my $x if

      achieve a kind of static variable. Since we intend to fix this bug, we
      don't want people relying on this behavior. You can achieve a similar
      static effect by declaring the variable in a separate block outside the
      function, eg
    <p class="Pp"></p>

    brace in regex is passed through in regex; marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in

  <dd>(W regexp) The simple rule to remember, if you want to match a literal
      <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> character (U+007B
      <span class="Li">&quot;LEFT CURLY BRACKET&quot;</span>) in a regular
      expression pattern, is to escape each literal instance of it in some way.
      Generally easiest is to precede it with a backslash, like
      <span class="Li">&quot;\{&quot;</span> or enclose it in square brackets
      (<span class="Li">&quot;[{]&quot;</span>). If the pattern delimiters are
      also braces, any matching right brace
      (<span class="Li">&quot;}&quot;</span>) should also be escaped to avoid
      confusing the parser, for example,
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> qr{abc\{def\}ghi}
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Forcing literal <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span>
        characters to be escaped enables the Perl language to be extended in
        various ways in future releases. To avoid needlessly breaking existing
        code, the restriction is not enforced in contexts where there are
        unlikely to ever be extensions that could conflict with the use there of
        <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> as a literal. Those that are not
        potentially ambiguous do not warn; those that are raise this warning.
        This makes sure that an inadvertent typo doesn't silently cause the
        pattern to compile to something unintended.</p>

  <dd>(F) A grapheme is what appears to a native-speaker of a language to be a
      character. In Unicode (and hence Perl) a grapheme may actually be several
      adjacent characters that together form a complete grapheme. For example,
      there can be a base character, like &quot;R&quot; and an accent, like a
      circumflex &quot;^&quot;, that appear when displayed to be a single
      character with the circumflex hovering over the &quot;R&quot;. Perl
      currently allows things like that circumflex to be delimiters of strings,
      patterns, <i>etc</i>. When displayed, the circumflex would look like it
      belongs to the character just to the left of it. In order to move the
      language to be able to accept graphemes as delimiters, we cannot allow the
      use of delimiters which aren't graphemes by themselves. Also, a delimiter
      must already be assigned (or known to be never going to be assigned) to
      try to future-proof code, for otherwise code that works today would fail
      to compile if the currently unassigned delimiter ends up being something
      that isn't a stand-alone grapheme. Because Unicode is never going to
      assign non-character code points, nor code points that are above the legal
      Unicode maximum, those can be delimiters, and their use is legal.</dd>

  <dt id="Variable"><a class="permalink" href="#Variable">Variable

  <dd>(W closure) During compilation, an inner named subroutine or eval is
      attempting to capture an outer lexical that is not currently available.
      This can happen for one of two reasons. First, the outer lexical may be
      declared in an outer anonymous subroutine that has not yet been created.
      (Remember that named subs are created at compile time, while anonymous
      subs are created at run-time.) For example,
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub { my $a; sub f { $a } }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">At the time that f is created, it can't capture the current
        value of <span class="Li">$a</span>, since the anonymous subroutine
        hasn't been created yet. Conversely, the following won't give a warning
        since the anonymous subroutine has by now been created and is live:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub { my $a; eval 'sub f { $a }' }-&gt;();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The second situation is caused by an eval accessing a variable
        that has gone out of scope, for example,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    sub f {
        my $a;
        sub { eval '$a' }
    }
    f()-&gt;();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Here, when the '$a' in the eval is being compiled, f() is not
        currently being executed, so its <span class="Li">$a</span> is not
        available for capture.</p>

        <span class="Li">&quot;ss&quot;</span> can match the single character

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This list is subject to change, but is quite unlikely to. Each

    <p class="Pp">You can avoid this by using a bracketed character class in the

    <p class="Pp">If this warning does come from I/O, the easiest way to quiet
        it is simply to add the <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> layer,
        <i>e.g.</i>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;binmode&#x00A0;STDOUT,&#x00A0;':utf8'&quot;</span>.
        Another way to turn off the warning is to add
        <span class="Li">&quot;no&#x00A0;warnings&#x00A0;'utf8';&quot;</span>
        but that is often closer to cheating. In general, you are supposed to
        explicitly mark the filehandle with an encoding, see open and
        &quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the warning comes from other than I/O, this diagnostic
        probably indicates that incorrect results are being obtained. You should
        examine your code to determine how a wide character is getting to an
        operation that doesn't handle them.</p>

    %s</a></dt>
  <dd>(W locale) While in a single-byte locale (<i>i.e.</i>, a non-UTF-8 one), a
      multi-byte character was encountered. Perl considers this character to be
      the specified Unicode code point. Combining non-UTF-8 locales and Unicode
      is dangerous. Almost certainly some characters will have two different
      representations. For example, in the ISO 8859-7 (Greek) locale, the code
      point 0xC3 represents a Capital Gamma. But so also does 0x393. This will
      make string comparisons unreliable.
    <p class="Pp">You likely need to figure out how this multi-byte character
        got mixed up with your single-byte locale (or perhaps you thought you
        had a UTF-8 locale, but Perl disagrees).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Within"><a class="permalink" href="#Within">Within []-length '%c' not
    allowed</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) The count in the (un)pack template may be replaced by
      <span class="Li">&quot;[TEMPLATE]&quot;</span> only if
      <span class="Li">&quot;TEMPLATE&quot;</span> always matches the same
      amount of packed bytes that can be determined from the template alone.
      This is not possible if it contains any of the codes @, /, U, u, w or a
      *-length. Redesign the template.</dd>
  <dt id="While"><a class="permalink" href="#While">While trying to resolve
    method call %s-&gt;%s() can not locate package &quot;%s&quot; yet it is
    mentioned in @%s::ISA (perhaps you forgot to load &quot;%s&quot;?)</a></dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) It is possible that the <span class="Li">@ISA</span> contains a
      misspelled or never loaded package name, which can result in perl choosing
      an unexpected parent class's method to resolve the method call. If this is
      deliberate you can do something like
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  @Missing::Package::ISA = ();
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">to silence the warnings, otherwise you should correct the
        package name, or ensure that the package is loaded prior to the method
        call.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>%s() with negative argument</dt>
  <dd>(S misc) Certain operations make no sense with negative arguments. Warning
      is given and the operation is not done.</dd>
  <dt id="write()"><a class="permalink" href="#write()"><b>write()</b> on closed
    filehandle %s</a></dt>
  <dd>(W closed) The filehandle you're writing to got itself closed sometime
      before now. Check your control flow.</dd>
  <dt>%s &quot;\x%X&quot; does not map to Unicode</dt>
  <dd>(S utf8) When reading in different encodings, Perl tries to map everything
      into Unicode characters. The bytes you read in are not legal in this
      encoding. For example
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    utf8 &quot;\xE4&quot; does not map to Unicode
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">if you try to read in the a-diaereses Latin-1 as UTF-8.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>'X' outside of string</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had a (un)pack template that specified a relative position before
      the beginning of the string being (un)packed. See &quot;pack&quot; in
      perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt>'x' outside of string in unpack</dt>
  <dd>(F) You had a pack template that specified a relative position after the
      end of the string being unpacked. See &quot;pack&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt id="YOU"><a class="permalink" href="#YOU">YOU HAVEN'T DISABLED SET-ID
    SCRIPTS IN THE KERNEL YET!</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) And you probably never will, because you probably don't have the
      sources to your kernel, and your vendor probably doesn't give a rip about
      what you want. There is a vulnerability anywhere that you have a set-id
      script, and to close it you need to remove the set-id bit from the script
      that you're attempting to run. To actually run the script set-id, your
      best bet is to put a set-id C wrapper around your script.</dd>
  <dt id="You"><a class="permalink" href="#You">You need to quote
    &quot;%s&quot;</a></dt>
  <dd>(W syntax) You assigned a bareword as a signal handler name.
      Unfortunately, you already have a subroutine of that name declared, which
      means that Perl 5 will try to call the subroutine when the assignment is
      executed, which is probably not what you want. (If it IS what you want,
      put an &amp; in front.)</dd>
  <dt id="Your"><a class="permalink" href="#Your">Your random numbers are not
    that random</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) When trying to initialize the random seed for hashes, Perl could not
      get any randomness out of your system. This usually indicates Something
      Very Wrong.</dd>
  <dt id="Zero"><a class="permalink" href="#Zero">Zero length \N{} in regex;
    marked by &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE in m/%s/</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) Named Unicode character escapes
      (<span class="Li">&quot;\N{...}&quot;</span>) may return a zero-length
      sequence. Such an escape was used in an extended character class, i.e.
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?[...])&quot;</span>, or under
      <span class="Li">&quot;use re 'strict'&quot;</span>, which is not
      permitted. Check that the correct escape has been used, and the correct
      charnames handler is in scope. The &lt;--&#x00A0;HERE shows whereabouts in
      the regular expression the problem was discovered.</dd>
