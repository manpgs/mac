<p class="Pp">This document describes differences between the 5.24.0 release and
    the 5.24.1 release.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.22.0, first
    read perl5240delta, which describes differences between 5.22.0 and
  5.24.0.</p>

<h2 class="Ss"><b>-Di</b> switch is now required for PerlIO debugging
  output</h2>
<p class="Pp">Previously PerlIO debugging output would be sent to the file
    specified by the <span class="Li">&quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot;</span>
    environment variable if perl wasn't running setuid and the <b>-T</b> or
    <b>-t</b> switches hadn't been parsed yet.</p>
<p class="Pp">If perl performed output at a point where it hadn't yet parsed its
    switches this could result in perl creating or overwriting the file named by
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot;</span> even when the <b>-T</b>
    switch had been supplied.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl now requires the <b>-Di</b> switch to produce PerlIO
    debugging output. By default this is written to
    <span class="Li">&quot;stderr&quot;</span>, but can optionally be redirected
    to a file by setting the <span class="Li">&quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot;</span>
    environment variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">If perl is running setuid or the <b>-T</b> switch was supplied
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERLIO_DEBUG&quot;</span> is ignored and the
    debugging output is sent to <span class="Li">&quot;stderr&quot;</span> as
    for any other <b>-D</b> switch.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Core_modules_and_tools_no_longer_search_"><a class="permalink" href="#Core_modules_and_tools_no_longer_search_">Core
  modules and tools no longer search <i>&quot;.&quot;</i> for optional
  modules</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The tools and many modules supplied in core no longer search the
    default current directory entry in <span class="Li">@INC</span> for optional
    modules. For example, Storable will remove the final <i>&quot;.&quot;</i>
    from <span class="Li">@INC</span> before trying to load Log::Agent.</p>
<p class="Pp">This prevents an attacker injecting an optional module into a
    process run by another user where the current directory is writable by the
    attacker, e.g. the <i>/tmp</i> directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">In most cases this removal should not cause problems, but
    difficulties were encountered with base, which treats every module name
    supplied as optional. These difficulties have not yet been resolved, so for
    this release there are no changes to base. We hope to have a fix for base in
    Perl 5.24.2.</p>
<p class="Pp">To protect your own code from this attack, either remove the
    default <i>&quot;.&quot;</i> entry from <span class="Li">@INC</span> at the
    start of your script, so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  #!/usr/bin/perl
  use strict;
  ...
</pre>
<p class="Pp">becomes:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  #!/usr/bin/perl
  BEGIN { pop @INC if $INC[-1] eq '.' }
  use strict;
  ...
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or for modules, remove <i>&quot;.&quot;</i> from a localized
    <span class="Li">@INC</span>, so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my $can_foo = eval { require Foo; }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">becomes:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  my $can_foo = eval {
      local @INC = @INC;
      pop @INC if $INC[-1] eq '.';
      require Foo;
  };

  <dd>The change to hashbang redirection introduced in Perl 5.24.0, whereby perl
      would redirect to another interpreter (Perl 6) if it found a hashbang path
      which contains &quot;perl&quot; followed by &quot;6&quot;, has been

<p class="Pp">Perl 5.24.1 represents approximately 8 months of development since
    Perl 5.24.0 and contains approximately 8,100 lines of changes across 240
    files from 18 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 2,200 lines of changes to 170 .pm, .t, .c and .h
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.24.1:</p>
<p class="Pp">Aaron Crane, Alex Vandiver, Aristotle Pagaltzis, Chad Granum,
    Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, Father Chrysostomos, James E
    Keenan, Jarkko Hietaniemi, Karen Etheridge, Leon Timmermans, Matthew
    Horsfall, Ricardo Signes, Sawyer X, Sebastien Aperghis-Tramoni, Stevan
    Little, Steve Hay, Tony Cook.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
