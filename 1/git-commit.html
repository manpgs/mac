<p class="Pp">Create a new commit containing the current contents of the index
    and the given log message describing the changes. The new commit is a direct
    child of HEAD, usually the tip of the current branch, and the branch is
    updated to point to it (unless no branch is associated with the working
    tree, in which case HEAD is &quot;detached&quot; as described in
    <b>git-checkout</b>(1)).</p>
<p class="Pp">The content to be committed can be specified in several ways:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.by using <b>git-add</b>(1) to incrementally
  &quot;add&quot; changes to the index before using the <i>commit</i> command
  (Note: even modified files must be &quot;added&quot;);</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.by using <b>git-rm</b>(1) to remove files from the
  working tree and the index, again before using the <i>commit</i>
  command;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.by listing files as arguments to the <i>commit</i>
  command (without --interactive or --patch switch), in which case the commit
  will ignore changes staged in the index, and instead record the current
  content of the listed files (which must already be known to Git);</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.by using the -a switch with the <i>commit</i> command
  to automatically &quot;add&quot; changes from all known files (i.e. all files
  that are already listed in the index) and to automatically &quot;rm&quot;
  files in the index that have been removed from the working tree, and then
  perform the actual commit;</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 5.by using the --interactive or --patch switches with
  the <i>commit</i> command to decide one by one which files or hunks should be
  part of the commit in addition to contents in the index, before finalizing the
  operation. See the &#x201C;Interactive Mode&#x201D; section of
  <b>git-add</b>(1) to learn how to operate these modes.</div>
<p class="Pp">The <b>--dry-run</b> option can be used to obtain a summary of
    what is included by any of the above for the next commit by giving the same
    set of parameters (options and paths).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you make a commit and then find a mistake immediately after
    that, you can recover from it with <i>git reset</i>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">-a, --all</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Tell the command to automatically stage files that have
  been modified and deleted, but new files you have not told Git about are not
  affected.</div>
<p class="Pp">-p, --patch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use the interactive patch selection interface to chose
  which changes to commit. See <b>git-add</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">-C &lt;commit&gt;, --reuse-message=&lt;commit&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Take an existing commit object, and reuse the log message
  and the authorship information (including the timestamp) when creating the
  commit.</div>
<p class="Pp">-c &lt;commit&gt;, --reedit-message=&lt;commit&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Like <i>-C</i>, but with <b>-c</b> the editor is invoked,
  so that the user can further edit the commit message.</div>
<p class="Pp">--fixup=[(amend|reword):]&lt;commit&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Create a new commit which &quot;fixes up&quot;
  <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> when applied with <b>git rebase --autosquash</b>. Plain
  <b>--fixup=&lt;commit&gt;</b> creates a &quot;fixup!&quot; commit which
  changes the content of <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> but leaves its log message
  untouched. <b>--fixup=amend:&lt;commit&gt;</b> is similar but creates an
  &quot;amend!&quot; commit which also replaces the log message of
  <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> with the log message of the &quot;amend!&quot; commit.
  <b>--fixup=reword:&lt;commit&gt;</b> creates an &quot;amend!&quot; commit
  which replaces the log message of <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> with its own log
  message but makes no changes to the content of <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>.
<p class="Pp">The commit created by plain <b>--fixup=&lt;commit&gt;</b> has a
    subject composed of &quot;fixup!&quot; followed by the subject line from
    &lt;commit&gt;, and is recognized specially by <b>git rebase
    --autosquash</b>. The <b>-m</b> option may be used to supplement the log
    message of the created commit, but the additional commentary will be thrown
    away once the &quot;fixup!&quot; commit is squashed into
    <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> by <b>git rebase --autosquash</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The commit created by <b>--fixup=amend:&lt;commit&gt;</b> is
    similar but its subject is instead prefixed with &quot;amend!&quot;. The log
    message of &lt;commit&gt; is copied into the log message of the
    &quot;amend!&quot; commit and opened in an editor so it can be refined. When
    <b>git rebase --autosquash</b> squashes the &quot;amend!&quot; commit into
    <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>, the log message of <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> is replaced
    by the refined log message from the &quot;amend!&quot; commit. It is an
    error for the &quot;amend!&quot; commit&#x2019;s log message to be empty
    unless <b>--allow-empty-message</b> is specified.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--fixup=reword:&lt;commit&gt;</b> is shorthand for
    <b>--fixup=amend:&lt;commit&gt; --only</b>. It creates an &quot;amend!&quot;
    commit with only a log message (ignoring any changes staged in the index).
    When squashed by <b>git rebase --autosquash</b>, it replaces the log message
    of <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> without making any other changes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Neither &quot;fixup!&quot; nor &quot;amend!&quot; commits change
    authorship of <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b> when applied by <b>git rebase
    --autosquash</b>. See <b>git-rebase</b>(1) for details.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--squash=&lt;commit&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Construct a commit message for use with <b>rebase
  --autosquash</b>. The commit message subject line is taken from the specified
  commit with a prefix of &quot;squash! &quot;. Can be used with additional
  commit message options (<b>-m</b>/<b>-c</b>/<b>-C</b>/<b>-F</b>). See
  <b>git-rebase</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">--reset-author</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When used with -C/-c/--amend options, or when committing
  after a conflicting cherry-pick, declare that the authorship of the resulting
  commit now belongs to the committer. This also renews the author
  timestamp.</div>
<p class="Pp">--short</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When doing a dry-run, give the output in the
  short-format. See <b>git-status</b>(1) for details. Implies
  <b>--dry-run</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--branch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the branch and tracking info even in
  short-format.</div>
<p class="Pp">--porcelain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When doing a dry-run, give the output in a
  porcelain-ready format. See <b>git-status</b>(1) for details. Implies
  <b>--dry-run</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--long</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When doing a dry-run, give the output in the long-format.
  Implies <b>--dry-run</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-z, --null</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When showing <b>short</b> or <b>porcelain</b> status
  output, print the filename verbatim and terminate the entries with NUL,
  instead of LF. If no format is given, implies the <b>--porcelain</b> output
  format. Without the <b>-z</b> option, filenames with &quot;unusual&quot;
  characters are quoted as explained for the configuration variable
  <b>core.quotePath</b> (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).</div>
<p class="Pp">-F &lt;file&gt;, --file=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Take the commit message from the given file. Use <i>-</i>
  to read the message from the standard input.</div>
<p class="Pp">--author=&lt;author&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Override the commit author. Specify an explicit author
  using the standard <b>A U Thor &lt;author@example.com&gt;</b> format.
  Otherwise &lt;author&gt; is assumed to be a pattern and is used to search for
  an existing commit by that author (i.e. rev-list --all -i
  --author=&lt;author&gt;); the commit author is then copied from the first such
  commit found.</div>
<p class="Pp">--date=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Override the author date used in the commit.</div>
<p class="Pp">-m &lt;msg&gt;, --message=&lt;msg&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use the given &lt;msg&gt; as the commit message. If
  multiple <b>-m</b> options are given, their values are concatenated as
  separate paragraphs.
<p class="Pp">The <b>-m</b> option is mutually exclusive with <b>-c</b>,
    <b>-C</b>, and <b>-F</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-t &lt;file&gt;, --template=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When editing the commit message, start the editor with
  the contents in the given file. The <b>commit.template</b> configuration
  variable is often used to give this option implicitly to the command. This
  mechanism can be used by projects that want to guide participants with some
  hints on what to write in the message in what order. If the user exits the
  editor without editing the message, the commit is aborted. This has no effect
  when a message is given by other means, e.g. with the <b>-m</b> or <b>-F</b>
  options.</div>
<p class="Pp">-s, --signoff, --no-signoff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Add a <b>Signed-off-by</b> trailer by the committer at
  the end of the commit log message. The meaning of a signoff depends on the
  project to which you&#x2019;re committing. For example, it may certify that
  the committer has the rights to submit the work under the project&#x2019;s
  license or agrees to some contributor representation, such as a Developer
  Certificate of Origin. (See <b>http://developercertificate.org</b> for the one
  used by the Linux kernel and Git projects.) Consult the documentation or
  leadership of the project to which you&#x2019;re contributing to understand
  how the signoffs are used in that project.
<p class="Pp">The --no-signoff option can be used to countermand an earlier
    --signoff option on the command line.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--trailer &lt;token&gt;[(=|:)&lt;value&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify a (&lt;token&gt;, &lt;value&gt;) pair that should
  be applied as a trailer. (e.g. <b>git commit --trailer &quot;Signed-off-by:C O
  Mitter \ &lt;committer@example.com&gt;&quot; --trailer &quot;Helped-by:C O
  Mitter \ &lt;committer@example.com&gt;&quot;</b> will add the
  &quot;Signed-off-by&quot; trailer and the &quot;Helped-by&quot; trailer to the
  commit message.) The <b>trailer.*</b> configuration variables
  (<b>git-interpret-trailers</b>(1)) can be used to define if a duplicated
  trailer is omitted, where in the run of trailers each trailer would appear,
  and other details.</div>
<p class="Pp">-n, --no-verify</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option bypasses the pre-commit and commit-msg hooks.
  See also <b>githooks</b>(5).</div>
<p class="Pp">--allow-empty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Usually recording a commit that has the exact same tree
  as its sole parent commit is a mistake, and the command prevents you from
  making such a commit. This option bypasses the safety, and is primarily for
  use by foreign SCM interface scripts.</div>
<p class="Pp">--allow-empty-message</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Like --allow-empty this command is primarily for use by
  foreign SCM interface scripts. It allows you to create a commit with an empty
  commit message without using plumbing commands like
  <b>git-commit-tree</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--cleanup=&lt;mode&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option determines how the supplied commit message
  should be cleaned up before committing. The <i>&lt;mode&gt;</i> can be
  <b>strip</b>, <b>whitespace</b>, <b>verbatim</b>, <b>scissors</b> or
  <b>default</b>.
<p class="Pp">strip</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Strip leading and trailing empty lines, trailing
  whitespace, commentary and collapse consecutive empty lines.</div>
<p class="Pp">whitespace</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Same as <b>strip</b> except #commentary is not
  removed.</div>
<p class="Pp">verbatim</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not change the message at all.</div>
<p class="Pp">scissors</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Same as <b>whitespace</b> except that everything from
  (and including) the line found below is truncated, if the message is to be
  edited. &quot;<b>#</b>&quot; can be customized with core.commentChar.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
# ------------------------ &gt;8 ------------------------
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">default</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Same as <b>strip</b> if the message is to be edited.
  Otherwise <b>whitespace</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">The default can be changed by the <b>commit.cleanup</b>
    configuration variable (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-e, --edit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The message taken from file with <b>-F</b>, command line
  with <b>-m</b>, and from commit object with <b>-C</b> are usually used as the
  commit log message unmodified. This option lets you further edit the message
  taken from these sources.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-edit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use the selected commit message without launching an
  editor. For example, <b>git commit --amend --no-edit</b> amends a commit
  without changing its commit message.</div>
<p class="Pp">--amend</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Replace the tip of the current branch by creating a new
  commit. The recorded tree is prepared as usual (including the effect of the
  <b>-i</b> and <b>-o</b> options and explicit pathspec), and the message from
  the original commit is used as the starting point, instead of an empty
  message, when no other message is specified from the command line via options
  such as <b>-m</b>, <b>-F</b>, <b>-c</b>, etc. The new commit has the same
  parents and author as the current one (the <b>--reset-author</b> option can
  countermand this).
<p class="Pp">It is a rough equivalent for:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        $ git reset --soft HEAD^
        $ ... do something else to come up with the right tree ...
        $ git commit -c ORIG_HEAD
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">but can be used to amend a merge commit.</p>
<p class="Pp">You should understand the implications of rewriting history if you
    amend a commit that has already been published. (See the &quot;RECOVERING
    FROM UPSTREAM REBASE&quot; section in <b>git-rebase</b>(1).)</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-post-rewrite</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Bypass the post-rewrite hook.</div>
<p class="Pp">-i, --include</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Before making a commit out of staged contents so far,
  stage the contents of paths given on the command line as well. This is usually
  not what you want unless you are concluding a conflicted merge.</div>
<p class="Pp">-o, --only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Make a commit by taking the updated working tree contents
  of the paths specified on the command line, disregarding any contents that
  have been staged for other paths. This is the default mode of operation of
  <i>git commit</i> if any paths are given on the command line, in which case
  this option can be omitted. If this option is specified together with
  <b>--amend</b>, then no paths need to be specified, which can be used to amend
  the last commit without committing changes that have already been staged. If
  used together with <b>--allow-empty</b> paths are also not required, and an
  empty commit will be created.</div>
<p class="Pp">--pathspec-from-file=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pathspec is passed in <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> instead of
  commandline args. If <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> is exactly <b>-</b> then standard
  input is used. Pathspec elements are separated by LF or CR/LF. Pathspec
  elements can be quoted as explained for the configuration variable
  <b>core.quotePath</b> (see <b>git-config</b>(1)). See also
  <b>--pathspec-file-nul</b> and global <b>--literal-pathspecs</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--pathspec-file-nul</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only meaningful with <b>--pathspec-from-file</b>.
  Pathspec elements are separated with NUL character and all other characters
  are taken literally (including newlines and quotes).</div>
<p class="Pp">-u[&lt;mode&gt;], --untracked-files[=&lt;mode&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show untracked files.
<p class="Pp">The mode parameter is optional (defaults to <i>all</i>), and is
    used to specify the handling of untracked files; when -u is not used, the
    default is <i>normal</i>, i.e. show untracked files and directories.</p>
<p class="Pp">The possible options are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>no</i> - Show no untracked files</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>normal</i> - Shows untracked files and
  directories</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>all</i> - Also shows individual files in
  untracked directories.</div>
<p class="Pp">The default can be changed using the status.showUntrackedFiles
    configuration variable documented in <b>git-config</b>(1).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-v, --verbose</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show unified diff between the HEAD commit and what would
  be committed at the bottom of the commit message template to help the user
  describe the commit by reminding what changes the commit has. Note that this
  diff output doesn&#x2019;t have its lines prefixed with <i>#</i>. This diff
  will not be a part of the commit message. See the <b>commit.verbose</b>
  configuration variable in <b>git-config</b>(1).
<p class="Pp">If specified twice, show in addition the unified diff between what
    would be committed and the worktree files, i.e. the unstaged changes to
    tracked files.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-q, --quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Suppress commit summary message.</div>
<p class="Pp">--dry-run</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not create a commit, but show a list of paths that are
  to be committed, paths with local changes that will be left uncommitted and
  paths that are untracked.</div>
<p class="Pp">--status</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Include the output of <b>git-status</b>(1) in the commit
  message template when using an editor to prepare the commit message. Defaults
  to on, but can be used to override configuration variable commit.status.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-status</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not include the output of <b>git-status</b>(1) in the
  commit message template when using an editor to prepare the default commit
  message.</div>
<p class="Pp">-S[&lt;keyid&gt;], --gpg-sign[=&lt;keyid&gt;], --no-gpg-sign</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">GPG-sign commits. The <b>keyid</b> argument is optional
  and defaults to the committer identity; if specified, it must be stuck to the
  option without a space. <b>--no-gpg-sign</b> is useful to countermand both
  <b>commit.gpgSign</b> configuration variable, and earlier
  <b>--gpg-sign</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not interpret any more arguments as options.</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;pathspec&gt;...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When pathspec is given on the command line, commit the
  contents of the files that match the pathspec without recording the changes
  already added to the index. The contents of these files are also staged for
  the next commit on top of what have been staged before.
<p class="Pp">For more details, see the <i>pathspec</i> entry in
    <b>gitglossary</b>(7).</p>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When recording your own work, the contents of modified files in
    your working tree are temporarily stored to a staging area called the
    &quot;index&quot; with <i>git add</i>. A file can be reverted back, only in
    the index but not in the working tree, to that of the last commit with
    <b>git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;</b>, which effectively reverts <i>git
    add</i> and prevents the changes to this file from participating in the next
    commit. After building the state to be committed incrementally with these
    commands, <b>git commit</b> (without any pathname parameter) is used to
    record what has been staged so far. This is the most basic form of the
    command. An example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ edit hello.c
$ git rm goodbye.c
$ git add hello.c
$ git commit
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of staging files after each individual change, you can
    tell <b>git commit</b> to notice the changes to the files whose contents are
    tracked in your working tree and do corresponding <b>git add</b> and <b>git
    rm</b> for you. That is, this example does the same as the earlier example
    if there is no other change in your working tree:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ edit hello.c
$ rm goodbye.c
$ git commit -a
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The command <b>git commit -a</b> first looks at your working tree,
    notices that you have modified hello.c and removed goodbye.c, and performs
    necessary <b>git add</b> and <b>git rm</b> for you.</p>
<p class="Pp">After staging changes to many files, you can alter the order the
    changes are recorded in, by giving pathnames to <b>git commit</b>. When
    pathnames are given, the command makes a commit that only records the
    changes made to the named paths:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ edit hello.c hello.h
$ git add hello.c hello.h
$ edit Makefile
$ git commit Makefile
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This makes a commit that records the modification to
    <b>Makefile</b>. The changes staged for <b>hello.c</b> and <b>hello.h</b>
    are not included in the resulting commit. However, their changes are not
    lost &#x2014; they are still staged and merely held back. After the above
    sequence, if you do:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git commit
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">this second commit would record the changes to <b>hello.c</b> and
    <b>hello.h</b> as expected.</p>
<p class="Pp">After a merge (initiated by <i>git merge</i> or <i>git pull</i>)
    stops because of conflicts, cleanly merged paths are already staged to be
    committed for you, and paths that conflicted are left in unmerged state. You
    would have to first check which paths are conflicting with <i>git status</i>
    and after fixing them manually in your working tree, you would stage the
    result as usual with <i>git add</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git status | grep unmerged
unmerged: hello.c
$ edit hello.c
$ git add hello.c
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">After resolving conflicts and staging the result, <b>git ls-files
    -u</b> would stop mentioning the conflicted path. When you are done, run
    <b>git commit</b> to finally record the merge:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git commit
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">As with the case to record your own changes, you can use <b>-a</b>
    option to save typing. One difference is that during a merge resolution, you
    cannot use <b>git commit</b> with pathnames to alter the order the changes
    are committed, because the merge should be recorded as a single commit. In
    fact, the command refuses to run when given pathnames (but see <b>-i</b>
    option).</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="COMMIT_INFORMATION"><a class="permalink" href="#COMMIT_INFORMATION">COMMIT
  INFORMATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Author and committer information is taken from the following
    environment variables, if set:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL
GIT_AUTHOR_DATE
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL
GIT_COMMITTER_DATE
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">(nb &quot;&lt;&quot;, &quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;\n&quot;s are
    stripped)</p>
<p class="Pp">The author and committer names are by convention some form of a
    personal name (that is, the name by which other humans refer to you),
    although Git does not enforce or require any particular form. Arbitrary
    Unicode may be used, subject to the constraints listed above. This name has
    no effect on authentication; for that, see the <b>credential.username</b>
    variable in <b>git-config</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">In case (some of) these environment variables are not set, the
    information is taken from the configuration items <b>user.name</b> and
    <b>user.email</b>, or, if not present, the environment variable EMAIL, or,
    if that is not set, system user name and the hostname used for outgoing mail
    (taken from <b>/etc/mailname</b> and falling back to the fully qualified
    hostname when that file does not exist).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>author.name</b> and <b>committer.name</b> and their
    corresponding email options override <b>user.name</b> and <b>user.email</b>
    if set and are overridden themselves by the environment variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">The typical usage is to set just the <b>user.name</b> and
    <b>user.email</b> variables; the other options are provided for more complex
    use cases.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <b>GIT_AUTHOR_DATE</b> and <b>GIT_COMMITTER_DATE</b>
    environment variables support the following date formats:</p>
<p class="Pp">Git internal format</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">It is <b>&lt;unix timestamp&gt; &lt;time zone
  offset&gt;</b>, where <b>&lt;unix timestamp&gt;</b> is the number of seconds
  since the UNIX epoch. <b>&lt;time zone offset&gt;</b> is a positive or
  negative offset from UTC. For example CET (which is 1 hour ahead of UTC) is
  <b>+0100</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">RFC 2822</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The standard email format as described by RFC 2822, for
  example <b>Thu, 07 Apr 2005 22:13:13 +0200</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">ISO 8601</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Time and date specified by the ISO 8601 standard, for
  example <b>2005-04-07T22:13:13</b>. The parser accepts a space instead of the
  <b>T</b> character as well. Fractional parts of a second will be ignored, for
  example <b>2005-04-07T22:13:13.019</b> will be treated as
  <b>2005-04-07T22:13:13</b>.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<br/>
In addition, the date part is accepted in the following formats:
  <b>YYYY.MM.DD</b>, <b>MM/DD/YYYY</b> and <b>DD.MM.YYYY</b>.
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In addition to recognizing all date formats above, the
    <b>--date</b> option will also try to make sense of other, more
    human-centric date formats, such as relative dates like
    &quot;yesterday&quot; or &quot;last Friday at noon&quot;.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DISCUSSION"><a class="permalink" href="#DISCUSSION">DISCUSSION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Though not required, it&#x2019;s a good idea to begin the commit
    message with a single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the
    change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description. The
    text up to the first blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit
    title, and that title is used throughout Git. For example,
    <b>git-format-patch</b>(1) turns a commit into email, and it uses the title
    on the Subject line and the rest of the commit in the body.</p>
<p class="Pp">Git is to some extent character encoding agnostic.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The contents of the blob objects are
  uninterpreted sequences of bytes. There is no encoding translation at the core
  level.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Path names are encoded in UTF-8 normalization
  form C. This applies to tree objects, the index file, ref names, as well as
  path names in command line arguments, environment variables and config files
  (<b>.git/config</b> (see <b>git-config</b>(1)), <b>gitignore</b>(5),
  <b>gitattributes</b>(5) and <b>gitmodules</b>(5)).
<p class="Pp">Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as
    sequences of non-NUL bytes, there are no path name encoding conversions
    (except on Mac and Windows). Therefore, using non-ASCII path names will
    mostly work even on platforms and file systems that use legacy extended
    ASCII encodings. However, repositories created on such systems will not work
    properly on UTF-8-based systems (e.g. Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice versa.
    Additionally, many Git-based tools simply assume path names to be UTF-8 and
    will fail to display other encodings correctly.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Commit log messages are typically encoded in
  UTF-8, but other extended ASCII encodings are also supported. This includes
  ISO-8859-x, CP125x and many others, but <i>not</i> UTF-16/32, EBCDIC and CJK
  multi-byte encodings (GBK, Shift-JIS, Big5, EUC-x, CP9xx etc.).</div>
<p class="Pp">Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in
    UTF-8, both the core and Git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF-8 on
    projects. If all participants of a particular project find it more
    convenient to use legacy encodings, Git does not forbid it. However, there
    are a few things to keep in mind.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.<i>git commit</i> and <i>git commit-tree</i> issues a
  warning if the commit log message given to it does not look like a valid UTF-8
  string, unless you explicitly say your project uses a legacy encoding. The way
  to say this is to have <b>i18n.commitEncoding</b> in <b>.git/config</b> file,
  like this:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
[i18n]
        commitEncoding = ISO-8859-1
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Commit objects created with the above setting record the value of
    <b>i18n.commitEncoding</b> in its <b>encoding</b> header. This is to help
    other people who look at them later. Lack of this header implies that the
    commit log message is encoded in UTF-8.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.<i>git log</i>, <i>git show</i>, <i>git blame</i> and
  friends look at the <b>encoding</b> header of a commit object, and try to
  re-code the log message into UTF-8 unless otherwise specified. You can specify
  the desired output encoding with <b>i18n.logOutputEncoding</b> in
  <b>.git/config</b> file, like this:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
[i18n]
        logOutputEncoding = ISO-8859-1
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If you do not have this configuration variable, the value of
    <b>i18n.commitEncoding</b> is used instead.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that we deliberately chose not to re-code the commit log
    message when a commit is made to force UTF-8 at the commit object level,
    because re-coding to UTF-8 is not necessarily a reversible operation.</p>
