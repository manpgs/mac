  Bug Fixes</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Starting in v5.18.0, a construct like
      <span class="Li">&quot;/[#](?{})/x&quot;</span> would have its
      <span class="Li">&quot;#&quot;</span> incorrectly interpreted as a
      comment. The code block would be skipped, unparsed. This has been
      corrected.</li>
  <li>A number of memory leaks related to the new, experimental regexp bracketed
      character class feature have been plugged.</li>
  <li>The OP allocation code now returns correctly aligned memory in all cases
      for <span class="Li">&quot;struct pmop&quot;</span>. Previously it could
      return memory only aligned to a 4-byte boundary, which is not correct for
      an ithreads build with 64 bit IVs on some 32 bit platforms. Notably, this
      caused the build to fail completely on sparc GNU/Linux. [RT #118055]</li>
  <li>The debugger's <span class="Li">&quot;man&quot;</span> command been fixed.
      It was broken in the v5.18.0 release. The
      <span class="Li">&quot;man&quot;</span> command is aliased to the names
      <span class="Li">&quot;doc&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;perldoc&quot;</span> - all now work again.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">@_</span> is now correctly visible in the debugger,
      fixing a regression introduced in v5.18.0's debugger. [RT #118169]</li>
  <li>Fixed a small number of regexp constructions that could either fail to
      match or crash perl when the string being matched against was allocated
      above the 2GB line on 32-bit systems. [RT #118175]</li>
  <li>Perl v5.16 inadvertently introduced a bug whereby calls to XSUBs that were
      not visible at compile time were treated as lvalues and could be assigned
      to, even when the subroutine was not an lvalue sub. This has been fixed.
      [perl #117947]</li>
  <li>Perl v5.18 inadvertently introduced a bug whereby dual-vars (i.e.
      variables with both string and numeric values, such as
      <span class="Li">$!</span> ) where the truthness of the variable was
      determined by the numeric value rather than the string value. [RT
    #118159]</li>
  <li>Perl v5.18 inadvertently introduced a bug whereby interpolating mixed up-
      and down-graded UTF-8 strings in a regex could result in malformed UTF-8
      in the pattern: specifically if a downgraded character in the range
      <span class="Li">&quot;\x80..\xff&quot;</span> followed a UTF-8 string,
      e.g.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    utf8::upgrade(  my $u = &quot;\x{e5}&quot;);
    utf8::downgrade(my $d = &quot;\x{e5}&quot;);
    /$u$d/
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">[perl #118297].</p>
  </li>
  <li>Lexical constants (<span class="Li">&quot;my sub a() { 42 }&quot;</span>)
      no longer crash when inlined.</li>
  <li>Parameter prototypes attached to lexical subroutines are now respected
      when compiling sub calls without parentheses. Previously, the prototypes
      were honoured only for calls <i>with</i> parentheses. [RT #116735]</li>
  <li>Syntax errors in lexical subroutines in combination with calls to the same
      subroutines no longer cause crashes at compile time.</li>
  <li>The dtrace sub-entry probe now works with lexical subs, instead of
      crashing [perl #118305].</li>
  <li>Undefining an inlinable lexical subroutine (<span class="Li">&quot;my sub
      foo() { 42 } undef</span> <span class="Li">&amp;foo&quot;</span>) would
      result in a crash if warnings were turned on.</li>
  <li>Deep recursion warnings no longer crash lexical subroutines. [RT
    #118521]</li>

<p class="Pp">Perl 5.18.1 represents approximately 2 months of development since
    Perl 5.18.0 and contains approximately 8,400 lines of changes across 60
    files from 12 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.18.1:</p>
<p class="Pp">Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Craig A. Berry, Dagfinn Ilmari
    Mannsaaker, David Mitchell, Father Chrysostomos, Karl Williamson, Lukas Mai,
    Nicholas Clark, Peter Martini, Ricardo Signes, Shlomi Fish, Tony Cook.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>

  Bugs</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
    recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
    database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
    http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
    a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
