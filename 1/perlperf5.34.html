</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This is an introduction to the use of performance and optimization
    techniques which can be used with particular reference to perl programs.
    While many perl developers have come from other languages, and can use their
    prior knowledge where appropriate, there are many other people who might
    benefit from a few perl specific pointers. If you want the condensed
    version, perhaps the best advice comes from the renowned Japanese Samurai,
    Miyamoto Musashi, who said:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> &quot;Do Not Engage in Useless Activity&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">in 1645.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OVERVIEW"><a class="permalink" href="#OVERVIEW">OVERVIEW</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Perhaps the most common mistake programmers make is to attempt to
    optimize their code before a program actually does anything useful - this is
    a bad idea. There's no point in having an extremely fast program that
    doesn't work. The first job is to get a program to <i>correctly</i> do
    something <b>useful</b>, (not to mention ensuring the test suite is fully
    functional), and only then to consider optimizing it. Having decided to
    optimize existing working code, there are several simple but essential steps
    to consider which are intrinsic to any optimization process.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">ONE STEP SIDEWAYS</h2>
<p class="Pp">Firstly, you need to establish a baseline time for the existing
    code, which timing needs to be reliable and repeatable. You'll probably want
    to use the <span class="Li">&quot;Benchmark&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;Devel::NYTProf&quot;</span> modules, or something
    similar, for this step, or perhaps the Unix system
    <span class="Li">&quot;time&quot;</span> utility, whichever is appropriate.
    See the base of this document for a longer list of benchmarking and
    profiling modules, and recommended further reading.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">ONE STEP FORWARD</h2>
<p class="Pp">Next, having examined the program for <i>hot spots</i>, (places
    where the code seems to run slowly), change the code with the intention of
    making it run faster. Using version control software, like
    <span class="Li">&quot;subversion&quot;</span>, will ensure no changes are
    irreversible. It's too easy to fiddle here and fiddle there - don't change
    too much at any one time or you might not discover which piece of code
    <b>really</b> was the slow bit.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">ANOTHER STEP SIDEWAYS</h2>
<p class="Pp">It's not enough to say: &quot;that will make it run faster&quot;,
    you have to check it. Rerun the code under control of the benchmarking or
    profiling modules, from the first step above, and check that the new code
    executed the <b>same task</b> in <i>less time</i>. Save your work and
    repeat...</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="GENERAL_GUIDELINES"><a class="permalink" href="#GENERAL_GUIDELINES">GENERAL
  GUIDELINES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The critical thing when considering performance is to remember
    there is no such thing as a <span class="Li">&quot;Golden
    Bullet&quot;</span>, which is why there are no rules, only guidelines.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is clear that inline code is going to be faster than subroutine
    or method calls, because there is less overhead, but this approach has the
    disadvantage of being less maintainable and comes at the cost of greater
    memory usage - there is no such thing as a free lunch. If you are searching
    for an element in a list, it can be more efficient to store the data in a
    hash structure, and then simply look to see whether the key is defined,
    rather than to loop through the entire array using <b>grep()</b> for
    instance. <b>substr()</b> may be (a lot) faster than <b>grep()</b> but not
    as flexible, so you have another trade-off to access. Your code may contain
    a line which takes 0.01 of a second to execute which if you call it 1,000
    times, quite likely in a program parsing even medium sized files for
    instance, you already have a 10 second delay, in just one single code
    location, and if you call that line 100,000 times, your entire program will
    slow down to an unbearable crawl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using a subroutine as part of your sort is a powerful way to get
    exactly what you want, but will usually be slower than the built-in
    <i>alphabetic</i> <span class="Li">&quot;cmp&quot;</span> and <i>numeric</i>
    <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;=&gt;&quot;</span> sort operators. It is possible
    to make multiple passes over your data, building indices to make the
    upcoming sort more efficient, and to use what is known as the
    <span class="Li">&quot;OM&quot;</span> (Orcish Maneuver) to cache the sort
    keys in advance. The cache lookup, while a good idea, can itself be a source
    of slowdown by enforcing a double pass over the data - once to setup the
    cache, and once to sort the data. Using
    <span class="Li">&quot;pack()&quot;</span> to extract the required sort key
    into a consistent string can be an efficient way to build a single string to
    compare, instead of using multiple sort keys, which makes it possible to use
    the standard, written in <span class="Li">&quot;c&quot;</span> and fast,
    perl <span class="Li">&quot;sort()&quot;</span> function on the output, and
    is the basis of the <span class="Li">&quot;GRT&quot;</span> (Guttman Rossler
    Transform). Some string combinations can slow the
    <span class="Li">&quot;GRT&quot;</span> down, by just being too plain
    complex for its own good.</p>
<p class="Pp">For applications using database backends, the standard
    <span class="Li">&quot;DBIx&quot;</span> namespace has tries to help with
    keeping things nippy, not least because it tries to <i>not</i> query the
    database until the latest possible moment, but always read the docs which
    come with your choice of libraries. Among the many issues facing developers
    dealing with databases should remain aware of is to always use
    <span class="Li">&quot;SQL&quot;</span> placeholders and to consider
    pre-fetching data sets when this might prove advantageous. Splitting up a
    large file by assigning multiple processes to parsing a single file, using
    say <span class="Li">&quot;POE&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;threads&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span> can also be a useful way of
    optimizing your usage of the available
    <span class="Li">&quot;CPU&quot;</span> resources, though this technique is
    fraught with concurrency issues and demands high attention to detail.</p>
<p class="Pp">Every case has a specific application and one or more exceptions,
    and there is no replacement for running a few tests and finding out which
    method works best for your particular environment, this is why writing
    optimal code is not an exact science, and why we love using Perl so much -
    TMTOWTDI.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BENCHMARKS"><a class="permalink" href="#BENCHMARKS">BENCHMARKS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Here are a few examples to demonstrate usage of Perl's
    benchmarking tools.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Assigning_and_Dereferencing_Variables."><a class="permalink" href="#Assigning_and_Dereferencing_Variables.">Assigning
  and Dereferencing Variables.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">I'm sure most of us have seen code which looks like, (or worse
    than), this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> if ( $obj-&gt;{_ref}-&gt;{_myscore} &gt;= $obj-&gt;{_ref}-&gt;{_yourscore} ) {
     ...
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This sort of code can be a real eyesore to read, as well as being
    very sensitive to typos, and it's much clearer to dereference the variable
    explicitly. We're side-stepping the issue of working with object-oriented
    programming techniques to encapsulate variable access via methods, only
    accessible through an object. Here we're just discussing the technical
    implementation of choice, and whether this has an effect on performance. We
    can see whether this dereferencing operation, has any overhead by putting
    comparative code in a file and running a
    <span class="Li">&quot;Benchmark&quot;</span> test.</p>
<p class="Pp"># dereference</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> #!/usr/bin/perl
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 use Benchmark;
 my $ref = {
         'ref'   =&gt; {
             _myscore    =&gt; '100 + 1',
             _yourscore  =&gt; '102 - 1',
         },
 };
 timethese(1000000, {
         'direct'       =&gt; sub {
           my $x = $ref-&gt;{ref}-&gt;{_myscore} . $ref-&gt;{ref}-&gt;{_yourscore} ;
         },
         'dereference'  =&gt; sub {
             my $ref  = $ref-&gt;{ref};
             my $myscore = $ref-&gt;{_myscore};
             my $yourscore = $ref-&gt;{_yourscore};
             my $x = $myscore . $yourscore;
         },
 });
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It's essential to run any timing measurements a sufficient number
    of times so the numbers settle on a numerical average, otherwise each run
    will naturally fluctuate due to variations in the environment, to reduce the
    effect of contention for <span class="Li">&quot;CPU&quot;</span> resources
    and network bandwidth for instance. Running the above code for one million
    iterations, we can take a look at the report output by the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Benchmark&quot;</span> module, to see which approach
    is the most effective.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> $&gt; perl dereference
 Benchmark: timing 1000000 iterations of dereference, direct...
 dereference:  2 wallclock secs ( 1.59 usr +  0.00 sys =  1.59 CPU) @ 628930.82/s (n=1000000)
     direct:  1 wallclock secs ( 1.20 usr +  0.00 sys =  1.20 CPU) @ 833333.33/s (n=1000000)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The difference is clear to see and the dereferencing approach is
    slower. While it managed to execute an average of 628,930 times a second
    during our test, the direct approach managed to run an additional 204,403
    times, unfortunately. Unfortunately, because there are many examples of code
    written using the multiple layer direct variable access, and it's usually
    horrible. It is, however, minusculy faster. The question remains whether the
    minute gain is actually worth the eyestrain, or the loss of
  maintainability.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Search_and_replace_or_tr"><a class="permalink" href="#Search_and_replace_or_tr">Search
  and replace or tr</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If we have a string which needs to be modified, while a regex will
    almost always be much more flexible, <span class="Li">&quot;tr&quot;</span>,
    an oft underused tool, can still be a useful. One scenario might be replace
    all vowels with another character. The regex solution might look like
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> $str =~ s/[aeiou]/x/g
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;tr&quot;</span> alternative might look
    like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> $str =~ tr/aeiou/xxxxx/
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We can put that into a test file which we can run to check which
    approach is the fastest, using a global <span class="Li">$STR</span>
    variable to assign to the <span class="Li">&quot;my $str&quot;</span>
    variable so as to avoid perl trying to optimize any of the work away by
    noticing it's assigned only the once.</p>
<p class="Pp"># regex-transliterate</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> #!/usr/bin/perl
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 use Benchmark;
 my $STR = &quot;$$-this and that&quot;;
 timethese( 1000000, {
 'sr'  =&gt; sub { my $str = $STR; $str =~ s/[aeiou]/x/g; return $str; },
 'tr'  =&gt; sub { my $str = $STR; $str =~ tr/aeiou/xxxxx/; return $str; },
 });
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Running the code gives us our results:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> $&gt; perl regex-transliterate
 Benchmark: timing 1000000 iterations of sr, tr...
         sr:  2 wallclock secs ( 1.19 usr +  0.00 sys =  1.19 CPU) @ 840336.13/s (n=1000000)
         tr:  0 wallclock secs ( 0.49 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.49 CPU) @ 2040816.33/s (n=1000000)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;tr&quot;</span> version is a clear
    winner. One solution is flexible, the other is fast - and it's appropriately
    the programmer's choice which to use.</p>

<p class="Pp">Interestingly we get slightly different results, which is mostly
    because the algorithm which generates the report is different, even though
    the output file format was allegedly identical. The elapsed, user and system
    times are clearly showing the time it took for
    <span class="Li">&quot;Devel::Profiler&quot;</span> to execute its own run,
    but the column listings feel more accurate somehow than the ones we had
    earlier from <span class="Li">&quot;Devel::DProf&quot;</span>. The 102%
    figure has disappeared, for example. This is where we have to use the tools
    at our disposal, and recognise their pros and cons, before using them.
    Interestingly, the numbers of calls for each subroutine are identical in the
    two reports, it's the percentages which differ. As the author of
    <span class="Li">&quot;Devel::Proviler&quot;</span> writes:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> ...running HTML::Template's test suite under Devel::DProf shows
 output() taking NO time but Devel::Profiler shows around 10% of the
 time is in output().  I don't know which to trust but my gut tells me
 something is wrong with Devel::DProf.  HTML::Template::output() is a
 big routine that's called for every test. Either way, something needs
 fixing.

<p class="Pp">You can immediately see a slightly different focus to the

<p class="Pp">Perl modules are not the only tools a performance analyst has at
    their disposal, system tools like <span class="Li">&quot;time&quot;</span>
    should not be overlooked as the next example shows, where we take a quick
    look at sorting. Many books, theses and articles, have been written about
    efficient sorting algorithms, and this is not the place to repeat such work,
    there's several good sorting modules which deserve taking a look at too:
    <span class="Li">&quot;Sort::Maker&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;Sort::Key&quot;</span> spring to mind. However, it's
    still possible to make some observations on certain Perl specific
    interpretations on issues relating to sorting data sets and give an example
    or two with regard to how sorting large data volumes can effect performance.
    Firstly, an often overlooked point when sorting large amounts of data, one
    can attempt to reduce the data set to be dealt with and in many cases
    <span class="Li">&quot;grep()&quot;</span> can be quite useful as a simple
    filter:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> @data = sort grep { /$filter/ } @incoming
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A command such as this can vastly reduce the volume of material to
    actually sort through in the first place, and should not be too lightly
    disregarded purely on the basis of its simplicity. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;KISS&quot;</span> principle is too often overlooked -
    the next example uses the simple system
    <span class="Li">&quot;time&quot;</span> utility to demonstrate. Let's take
    a look at an actual example of sorting the contents of a large file, an
    apache logfile would do. This one has over a quarter of a million lines, is
    50M in size, and a snippet of it looks like this:</p>

<p class="Pp">BTW. Beware too of pressure from managers who see you speed a
    program up by 50% of the runtime once, only to get a request one month later
    to do the same again (true story) - you'll just have to point out you're
    only human, even if you are a Perl programmer, and you'll see what you can

<h1 class="Sh" id="LOGGING"><a class="permalink" href="#LOGGING">LOGGING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">An essential part of any good development process is appropriate
    error handling with appropriately informative messages, however there exists
    a school of thought which suggests that log files should be <i>chatty</i>,
    as if the chain of unbroken output somehow ensures the survival of the
    program. If speed is in any way an issue, this approach is wrong.</p>
<p class="Pp">A common sight is code which looks something like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> logger-&gt;debug( &quot;A logging message via process-id: $$ INC: &quot;
                                                       . Dumper(\%INC) )
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The problem is that this code will always be parsed and executed,
    even when the debug level set in the logging configuration file is zero.
    Once the <b>debug()</b> subroutine has been entered, and the internal
    <span class="Li">$debug</span> variable confirmed to be zero, for example,
    the message which has been sent in will be discarded and the program will
    continue. In the example given though, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;\%INC&quot;</span> hash will already have been
    dumped, and the message string constructed, all of which work could be
    bypassed by a debug variable at the statement level, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> logger-&gt;debug( &quot;A logging message via process-id: $$ INC: &quot;
                                            . Dumper(\%INC) ) if $DEBUG;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This effect can be demonstrated by setting up a test script with
    both forms, including a <span class="Li">&quot;debug()&quot;</span>
    subroutine to emulate typical <span class="Li">&quot;logger()&quot;</span>
    functionality.</p>
<p class="Pp"># ifdebug</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> #!/usr/bin/perl
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 use Benchmark;
 use Data::Dumper;
 my $DEBUG = 0;
 sub debug {
     my $msg = shift;
     if ( $DEBUG ) {
         print &quot;DEBUG: $msg\n&quot;;
     }
 };
 timethese(100000, {
         'debug'       =&gt; sub {
             debug( &quot;A $0 logging message via process-id: $$&quot; . Dumper(\%INC) )
         },
         'ifdebug'  =&gt; sub {
             debug( &quot;A $0 logging message via process-id: $$&quot; . Dumper(\%INC) ) if $DEBUG
         },
 });
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Let's see what <span class="Li">&quot;Benchmark&quot;</span> makes
    of this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> $&gt; perl ifdebug
 Benchmark: timing 100000 iterations of constant, sub...
    ifdebug:  0 wallclock secs ( 0.01 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.01 CPU) @ 10000000.00/s (n=100000)
             (warning: too few iterations for a reliable count)
      debug: 14 wallclock secs (13.18 usr +  0.04 sys = 13.22 CPU) @ 7564.30/s (n=100000)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In the one case the code, which does exactly the same thing as far
    as outputting any debugging information is concerned, in other words
    nothing, takes 14 seconds, and in the other case the code takes one
    hundredth of a second. Looks fairly definitive. Use a
    <span class="Li">$DEBUG</span> variable BEFORE you call the subroutine,
    rather than relying on the smart functionality inside it.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Logging_if_"><a class="permalink" href="#Logging_if_">Logging
  if DEBUG (constant)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">It's possible to take the previous idea a little further, by using
    a compile time <span class="Li">&quot;DEBUG&quot;</span> constant.</p>
<p class="Pp"># ifdebug-constant</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> #!/usr/bin/perl
 use strict;
 use warnings;
 use Benchmark;
 use Data::Dumper;
 use constant
     DEBUG =&gt; 0
 ;
 sub debug {
     if ( DEBUG ) {
         my $msg = shift;
         print &quot;DEBUG: $msg\n&quot;;
     }
 };
 timethese(100000, {
         'debug'       =&gt; sub {
             debug( &quot;A $0 logging message via process-id: $$&quot; . Dumper(\%INC) )
         },
         'constant'  =&gt; sub {
             debug( &quot;A $0 logging message via process-id: $$&quot; . Dumper(\%INC) ) if DEBUG
         },
 });
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Running this program produces the following output:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> $&gt; perl ifdebug-constant
 Benchmark: timing 100000 iterations of constant, sub...
   constant:  0 wallclock secs (-0.00 usr +  0.00 sys = -0.00 CPU) @ -7205759403792793600000.00/s (n=100000)
             (warning: too few iterations for a reliable count)
        sub: 14 wallclock secs (13.09 usr +  0.00 sys = 13.09 CPU) @ 7639.42/s (n=100000)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;DEBUG&quot;</span> constant wipes the
    floor with even the <span class="Li">$debug</span> variable, clocking in at
    minus zero seconds, and generates a &quot;warning: too few iterations for a
    reliable count&quot; message into the bargain. To see what is really going
    on, and why we had too few iterations when we thought we asked for 100000,
    we can use the very useful <span class="Li">&quot;B::Deparse&quot;</span> to
    inspect the new code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> $&gt; perl -MO=Deparse ifdebug-constant
 use Benchmark;
 use Data::Dumper;
 use constant ('DEBUG', 0);
 sub debug {
     use warnings;
     use strict 'refs';
     0;
 }
 use warnings;
 use strict 'refs';
 timethese(100000, {'sub', sub {
     debug &quot;A $0 logging message via process-id: $$&quot; . Dumper(\%INC);
 }
 , 'constant', sub {
     0;
 }
 });
 ifdebug-constant syntax OK
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The output shows the <b>constant()</b> subroutine we're testing
    being replaced with the value of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;DEBUG&quot;</span> constant: zero. The line to be
    tested has been completely optimized away, and you can't get much more
    efficient than that.</p>

<p class="Pp">This document has provided several way to go about identifying
    hot-spots, and checking whether any modifications have improved the runtime
    of the code.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a final thought, remember that it's not (at the time of
    writing) possible to produce a useful program which will run in zero or
    negative time and this basic principle can be written as: <i>useful programs
    are slow</i> by their very definition. It is of course possible to write a
    nearly instantaneous program, but it's not going to do very much, here's a
    very efficient one:</p>
