<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This program is designed to help you generate bug reports (and
    thank-you notes) about perl5 and the modules which ship with it.</p>
<p class="Pp">In most cases, you can just run it interactively from a command
    line without any special arguments and follow the prompts.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you have found a bug with a non-standard port (one that was not
    part of the <i>standard distribution</i>), a binary distribution, or a
    non-core module (such as Tk, DBI, etc), then please see the documentation
    that came with that distribution to determine the correct place to report
    bugs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Bug reports should be submitted to the GitHub issue tracker at
    &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;. The <b>perlbug@perl.org</b>
    address no longer automatically opens tickets. You can use this tool to
    compose your report and save it to a file which you can then submit to the
    issue tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">In extreme cases, <b>perlbug</b> may not work well enough on your
    system to guide you through composing a bug report. In those cases, you may
    be able to use <b>perlbug -d</b> or <b>perl -V</b> to get system
    configuration information to include in your issue report.</p>
<p class="Pp">When reporting a bug, please run through this checklist:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="What"><a class="permalink" href="#What">What version of Perl you are
    running?</a></dt>
  <dd>Type <span class="Li">&quot;perl -v&quot;</span> at the command line to
      find out.</dd>
  <dt id="Are"><a class="permalink" href="#Are">Are you running the latest
    released version of perl?</a></dt>
  <dd>Look at http://www.perl.org/ to find out. If you are not using the latest
      released version, please try to replicate your bug on the latest stable
      release.
    <p class="Pp">Note that reports about bugs in old versions of Perl,
        especially those which indicate you haven't also tested the current
        stable release of Perl, are likely to receive less attention from the
        volunteers who build and maintain Perl than reports about bugs in the
        current release.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This tool isn't appropriate for reporting bugs in any version
        prior to Perl 5.0.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Are~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Are~2">Are you sure what you have
    is a bug?</a></dt>
  <dd>A significant number of the bug reports we get turn out to be documented
      features in Perl. Make sure the issue you've run into isn't intentional by
      glancing through the documentation that comes with the Perl distribution.
    <p class="Pp">Given the sheer volume of Perl documentation, this isn't a
        trivial undertaking, but if you can point to documentation that suggests
        the behaviour you're seeing is <i>wrong</i>, your issue is likely to
        receive more attention. You may want to start with <b>perldoc</b>
        perltrap for pointers to common traps that new (and experienced) Perl
        programmers run into.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you're unsure of the meaning of an error message you've run
        across, <b>perldoc</b> perldiag for an explanation. If the message isn't
        in perldiag, it probably isn't generated by Perl. You may have luck
        consulting your operating system documentation instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you are on a non-UNIX platform <b>perldoc</b> perlport, as
        some features may be unimplemented or work differently.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You may be able to figure out what's going wrong using the
        Perl debugger. For information about how to use the debugger
        <b>perldoc</b> perldebug.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Do"><a class="permalink" href="#Do">Do you have a proper test
    case?</a></dt>
  <dd>The easier it is to reproduce your bug, the more likely it will be fixed
      -- if nobody can duplicate your problem, it probably won't be addressed.
    <p class="Pp">A good test case has most of these attributes: short, simple
        code; few dependencies on external commands, modules, or libraries; no
        platform-dependent code (unless it's a platform-specific bug); clear,
        simple documentation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A good test case is almost always a good candidate to be
        included in Perl's test suite. If you have the time, consider writing
        your test case so that it can be easily included into the standard test
        suite.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Have"><a class="permalink" href="#Have">Have you included all relevant
    information?</a></dt>
  <dd>Be sure to include the <b>exact</b> error messages, if any. &quot;Perl
      gave an error&quot; is not an exact error message.
    <p class="Pp">If you get a core dump (or equivalent), you may use a debugger
        (<b>dbx</b>, <b>gdb</b>, etc) to produce a stack trace to include in the
        bug report.</p>
    <p class="Pp">NOTE: unless your Perl has been compiled with debug info
        (often <b>-g</b>), the stack trace is likely to be somewhat hard to use
        because it will most probably contain only the function names and not
        their arguments. If possible, recompile your Perl with debug info and
        reproduce the crash and the stack trace.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Can"><a class="permalink" href="#Can">Can you describe the bug in
    plain English?</a></dt>
  <dd>The easier it is to understand a reproducible bug, the more likely it will
      be fixed. Any insight you can provide into the problem will help a great
      deal. In other words, try to analyze the problem (to the extent you can)
      and report your discoveries.</dd>
  <dt id="Can~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Can~2">Can you fix the bug
    yourself?</a></dt>
  <dd>If so, that's great news; bug reports with patches are likely to receive
      significantly more attention and interest than those without patches.
      Please submit your patch via the GitHub Pull Request workflow as described
      in <b>perldoc</b> perlhack. You may also send patches to
      <b>perl5-porters@perl.org</b>. When sending a patch, create it using
      <span class="Li">&quot;git format-patch&quot;</span> if possible, though a
      unified diff created with <span class="Li">&quot;diff -pu&quot;</span>
      will do nearly as well.
    <p class="Pp">Your patch may be returned with requests for changes, or
        requests for more detailed explanations about your fix.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here are a few hints for creating high-quality patches:</p>
    <p class="Pp">Make sure the patch is not reversed (the first argument to
        diff is typically the original file, the second argument your changed
        file). Make sure you test your patch by applying it with
        <span class="Li">&quot;git am&quot;</span> or the
        <span class="Li">&quot;patch&quot;</span> program before you send it on
        its way. Try to follow the same style as the code you are trying to
        patch. Make sure your patch really does work
        (<span class="Li">&quot;make test&quot;</span>, if the thing you're
        patching is covered by Perl's test suite).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Can~3"><a class="permalink" href="#Can~3">Can you use
    &quot;perlbug&quot; to submit a thank-you note?</a></dt>
  <dd>Yes, you can do this by either using the
      <span class="Li">&quot;-T&quot;</span> option, or by invoking the program
      as <span class="Li">&quot;perlthanks&quot;</span>. Thank-you notes are
      good. It makes people smile.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Please make your issue title informative. &quot;a bug&quot; is not
    informative. Neither is &quot;perl crashes&quot; nor is &quot;HELP!!!&quot;.
    These don't help. A compact description of what's wrong is fine.</p>
<p class="Pp">Having done your bit, please be prepared to wait, to be told the
    bug is in your code, or possibly to get no reply at all. The volunteers who
    maintain Perl are busy folks, so if your problem is an obvious bug in your
    own code, is difficult to understand or is a duplicate of an existing
    report, you may not receive a personal reply.</p>
<p class="Pp">If it is important to you that your bug be fixed, do monitor the
    issue tracker (you will be subscribed to notifications for issues you submit
    or comment on) and the commit logs to development versions of Perl, and
    encourage the maintainers with kind words or offers of frosty beverages.
    (Please do be kind to the maintainers. Harassing or flaming them is likely
    to have the opposite effect of the one you want.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Feel free to update the ticket about your bug on
    http://rt.perl.org if a new version of Perl is released and your bug is
    still present.</p>
