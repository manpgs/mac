<p class="Pp">The following types of expansions are performed in the indicated
    order in five steps:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>History Expansion</i></dt>
  <dd>This is performed only in interactive shells.</dd>
  <dt id="Alias"><a class="permalink" href="#Alias"><i>Alias
    Expansion</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Aliases are expanded immediately before the command line is parsed as
      explained under Aliasing in <i>zshmisc</i>(1).</dd>
  <dt><i>Process Substitution</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><i>Parameter Expansion</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><i>Command Substitution</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><i>Arithmetic Expansion</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><i>Brace Expansion</i></dt>
  <dd>These five are performed in left-to-right fashion. On each argument, any
      of the five steps that are needed are performed one after the other.
      Hence, for example, all the parts of parameter expansion are completed
      before command substitution is started. After these expansions, all
      unquoted occurrences of the characters `<b>\</b>',`<b>'</b>' and
      `<b>&quot;</b>' are removed.</dd>
  <dt id="Filename"><a class="permalink" href="#Filename"><i>Filename
    Expansion</i></a></dt>
  <dd>If the <b>SH_FILE_EXPANSION</b> option is set, the order of expansion is
      modified for compatibility with <b>sh</b> and <b>ksh</b>. In that case
      <i>filename expansion</i> is performed immediately after <i>alias
      expansion</i>, preceding the set of five expansions mentioned above.</dd>
  <dt id="Filename~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Filename~2"><i>Filename
    Generation</i></a></dt>
  <dd>This expansion, commonly referred to as <b>globbing</b>, is always done
      last.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The following sections explain the types of expansion in
  detail.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="HISTORY_EXPANSION"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTORY_EXPANSION">HISTORY
  EXPANSION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">History expansion allows you to use words from previous command
    lines in the command line you are typing. This simplifies spelling
    corrections and the repetition of complicated commands or arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp">Immediately before execution, each command is saved in the history
    list, the size of which is controlled by the <b>HISTSIZE</b> parameter. The
    one most recent command is always retained in any case. Each saved command
    in the history list is called a history <i>event</i> and is assigned a
    number, beginning with 1 (one) when the shell starts up. The history number
    that you may see in your prompt (see EXPANSION OF PROMPT SEQUENCES in
    <i>zshmisc</i>(1)) is the number that is to be assigned to the <i>next</i>
    command.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Overview"><a class="permalink" href="#Overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A history expansion begins with the first character of the
    <b>histchars</b> parameter, which is `<b>!</b>' by default, and may occur
    anywhere on the command line, including inside double quotes (but not inside
    single quotes <b>'...'</b> or C-style quotes <b>$'...'</b> nor when escaped
    with a backslash).</p>
<p class="Pp">The first character is followed by an optional event designator
    (see the section `Event Designators') and then an optional word designator
    (the section `Word Designators'); if neither of these designators is
    present, no history expansion occurs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Input lines containing history expansions are echoed after being
    expanded, but before any other expansions take place and before the command
    is executed. It is this expanded form that is recorded as the history event
    for later references.</p>
<p class="Pp">History expansions do not nest.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, a history reference with no event designator refers to
    the same event as any preceding history reference on that command line; if
    it is the only history reference in a command, it refers to the previous
    command. However, if the option <b>CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY</b> is set, then every
    history reference with no event specification <i>always</i> refers to the
    previous command.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, `<b>!</b>' is the event designator for the previous
    command, so `<b>!!:1</b>' always refers to the first word of the previous
    command, and `<b>!!$</b>' always refers to the last word of the previous
    command. With <b>CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY</b> set, then `<b>!:1</b>' and
    `<b>!$</b>' function in the same manner as `<b>!!:1</b>' and `<b>!!$</b>',
    respectively. Conversely, if <b>CSH_JUNKIE_HISTORY</b> is unset, then
    `<b>!:1</b>' and `<b>!$</b>' refer to the first and last words,
    respectively, of the same event referenced by the nearest other history
    reference preceding them on the current command line, or to the previous
    command if there is no preceding reference.</p>
<p class="Pp">The character sequence `<b>^</b><i>foo</i><b>^</b><i>bar</i>'
    (where `<b>^</b>' is actually the second character of the <b>histchars</b>
    parameter) repeats the last command, replacing the string <i>foo</i> with
    <i>bar</i>. More precisely, the sequence
    `<b>^</b><i>foo</i><b>^</b><i>bar</i><b>^</b>' is synonymous with
    `<b>!!:s</b><b>^</b><i>foo</i><b>^</b><i>bar</i><b>^</b>', hence other
    modifiers (see the section `Modifiers') may follow the final `<b>^</b>'. In
    particular, `<b>^</b><i>foo</i><b>^</b><i>bar</i><b>^:G</b>' performs a
    global substitution.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the shell encounters the character sequence `<b>!&quot;</b>' in
    the input, the history mechanism is temporarily disabled until the current
    list (see <i>zshmisc</i>(1)) is fully parsed. The `<b>!&quot;</b>' is
    removed from the input, and any subsequent `<b>!</b>' characters have no
    special significance.</p>
<p class="Pp">A less convenient but more comprehensible form of command history
    support is provided by the <b>fc</b> builtin.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Event_Designators"><a class="permalink" href="#Event_Designators">Event
  Designators</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">An event designator is a reference to a command-line entry in the
    history list. In the list below, remember that the initial <b>`!'</b> in
    each item may be changed to another character by setting the
    <b>histchars</b> parameter.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>!</b></dt>
  <dd>Start a history expansion, except when followed by a blank, newline,
      `<b>=</b>' or `<b>(</b>'. If followed immediately by a word designator
      (see the section `Word Designators'), this forms a history reference with
      no event designator (see the section `Overview').</dd>
  <dt><b>!!</b></dt>
  <dd>Refer to the previous command. By itself, this expansion repeats the
      previous command.</dd>
  <dt><b>!</b><i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>Refer to command-line <i>n</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>!-</b><i>n</i></dt>

      or followed by any text that is not to be considered part of
    <i>str</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>!#</b></dt>
  <dd>Refer to the current command line typed in so far. The line is treated as

  <dt><b>!{</b>...<b>}</b></dt>
  <dd>Insulate a history reference from adjacent characters (if necessary).</dd>

</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Word_Designators"><a class="permalink" href="#Word_Designators">Word
  Designators</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A word designator indicates which word or words of a given command
    line are to be included in a history reference. A `<b>:</b>' usually
    separates the event specification from the word designator. It may be
    omitted only if the word designator begins with a `<b>^</b>', `<b>$</b>',
    `<b>*</b>', `<b>-</b>' or `<b>%</b>'. Word designators include:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>0</b></dt>
  <dd>The first input word (command).</dd>
  <dt id="n"><a class="permalink" href="#n"><i>n</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The <i>n</i>th argument.</dd>
  <dt><b>^</b></dt>
  <dd>The first argument. That is, <b>1</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>$</b></dt>
  <dd>The last argument.</dd>
  <dt><b>%</b></dt>
  <dd>The word matched by (the most recent) <b>?</b><i>str</i> search.</dd>
  <dt id="x"><a class="permalink" href="#x"><i>x</i><b>-</b><i>y</i></a></dt>
  <dd>A range of words; <i>x</i> defaults to <b>0</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>All the arguments, or a null value if there are none.</dd>
  <dt id="x~2"><a class="permalink" href="#x~2"><i>x</i><b>*</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Abbreviates `<i>x</i><b>-$</b>'.</dd>
  <dt id="x~3"><a class="permalink" href="#x~3"><i>x</i><b>-</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Like `<i>x</i><b>*</b>' but omitting word <b>$</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Note that a `<b>%</b>' word designator works only when used in one
    of `<b>!%</b>', `<b>!:%</b>' or `<b>!?</b><i>str</i><b>?:%</b>', and only
    when used after a <b>!?</b> expansion (possibly in an earlier command).
    Anything else results in an error, although the error may not be the most
    obvious one.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Modifiers"><a class="permalink" href="#Modifiers">Modifiers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">After the optional word designator, you can add a sequence of one
    or more of the following modifiers, each preceded by a `<b>:</b>'. These
    modifiers also work on the result of <i>filename generation</i> and
    <i>parameter expansion</i>, except where noted.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>a</b></dt>
  <dd>Turn a file name into an absolute path: prepends the current directory, if
      necessary; remove `<b>.</b>' path segments; and remove `<b>..</b>' path
      segments and the segments that immediately precede them.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">This transformation is agnostic about what is in the filesystem,
    i.e. is on the logical, not the physical directory. It takes place in the
    same manner as when changing directories when neither of the options
    <b>CHASE_DOTS</b> or <b>CHASE_LINKS</b> is set. For example,
    `<b>/before/here/../after</b>' is always transformed to
    `<b>/before/after</b>', regardless of whether `<b>/before/here</b>' exists
    or what kind of object (dir, file, symlink, etc.) it is.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="A"><a class="permalink" href="#A"><b>A</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Turn a file name into an absolute path as the `<b>a</b>' modifier does,
      and <i>then</i> pass the result through the <b>realpath(3)</b> library
      function to resolve symbolic links.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Note: on systems that do not have a <b>realpath(3)</b> library
    function, symbolic links are not resolved, so on those systems `<b>a</b>'
    and `<b>A</b>' are equivalent.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: <b>foo:A</b> and <b>realpath(foo)</b> are different on some
    inputs. For <b>realpath(foo)</b> semantics, see the `<b>P</b>` modifier.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="c"><a class="permalink" href="#c"><b>c</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Resolve a command name into an absolute path by searching the command path
      given by the <b>PATH</b> variable. This does not work for commands
      containing directory parts. Note also that this does not usually work as a
      glob qualifier unless a file of the same name is found in the current
      directory.</dd>
  <dt id="e"><a class="permalink" href="#e"><b>e</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Remove all but the part of the filename extension following the
      `<b>.</b>'; see the definition of the filename extension in the
      description of the <b>r</b> modifier below. Note that according to that
      definition the result will be empty if the string ends with a
    `<b>.</b>'.</dd>
  <dt id="h"><a class="permalink" href="#h"><b>h</b> [ <i>digits</i> ]</a></dt>
  <dd>Remove a trailing pathname component, shortening the path by one directory
      level: this is the `head' of the pathname. This works like
      `<b>dirname</b>'. If the <b>h</b> is followed immediately (with no spaces
      or other separator) by any number of decimal digits, and the value of the
      resulting number is non-zero, that number of leading components is
      preserved instead of the final component being removed. In an absolute
      path the leading `<b>/</b>' is the first component, so, for example, if
      <b>var=/my/path/to/something</b>, then <b>${var:h3}</b> substitutes
      <b>/my/path</b>. Consecutive `/'s are treated the same as a single `/'. In
      parameter substitution, digits may only be used if the expression is in
      braces, so for example the short form substitution <b>$var:h2</b> is
      treated as <b>${var:h}2</b>, not as <b>${var:h2}</b>. No restriction
      applies to the use of digits in history substitution or globbing
      qualifiers. If more components are requested than are present, the entire
      path is substituted (so this does not trigger a `failed modifier' error in
      history expansion).</dd>
  <dt id="l"><a class="permalink" href="#l"><b>l</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Convert the words to all lowercase.</dd>
  <dt id="p"><a class="permalink" href="#p"><b>p</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print the new command but do not execute it. Only works with history
      expansion.</dd>
  <dt id="P"><a class="permalink" href="#P"><b>P</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Turn a file name into an absolute path, like <b>realpath(3)</b>. The
      resulting path will be absolute, have neither `<b>.</b>' nor `<b>..</b>'
      components, and refer to the same directory entry as the input
    filename.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Unlike <b>realpath(3)</b>, non-existent trailing components are
    permitted and preserved.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="q"><a class="permalink" href="#q"><b>q</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Quote the substituted words, escaping further substitutions. Works with
      history expansion and parameter expansion, though for parameters it is
      only useful if the resulting text is to be re-evaluated such as by
      <b>eval</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="Q"><a class="permalink" href="#Q"><b>Q</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Remove one level of quotes from the substituted words.</dd>
  <dt id="r"><a class="permalink" href="#r"><b>r</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Remove a filename extension leaving the root name. Strings with no
      filename extension are not altered. A filename extension is a `<b>.</b>'
      followed by any number of characters (including zero) that are neither
      `<b>.</b>' nor `<b>/</b>' and that continue to the end of the string. For
      example, the extension of `<b>foo.orig.c</b>' is `<b>.c</b>', and
      `<b>dir.c/foo</b>' has no extension.</dd>
  <dt id="s/"><a class="permalink" href="#s/"><b>s/</b><i>l</i><b>/</b><i>r</i>[<b>/</b>]</a></dt>
  <dd>Substitute <i>r</i> for <i>l</i> as described below. The substitution is
      done only for the first string that matches <i>l</i>. For arrays and for
      filename generation, this applies to each word of the expanded text. See
      below for further notes on substitutions.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The forms `<b>gs/</b><i>l</i><b>/</b><i>r</i>' and
    `<b>s/</b><i>l</i><b>/</b><i>r</i><b>/:G</b>' perform global substitution,
    i.e. substitute every occurrence of <i>r</i> for <i>l</i>. Note that the
    <b>g</b> or <b>:G</b> must appear in exactly the position shown.</p>
<p class="Pp">See further notes on this form of substitution below.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>&amp;</b></dt>
  <dd>Repeat the previous <b>s</b> substitution. Like <b>s</b>, may be preceded
      immediately by a <b>g</b>. In parameter expansion the <b>&amp;</b> must
      appear inside braces, and in filename generation it must be quoted with a
      backslash.</dd>
  <dt id="t"><a class="permalink" href="#t"><b>t</b> [ <i>digits</i> ]</a></dt>
  <dd>Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the final component
      (tail). This works like `<b>basename</b>'. Any trailing slashes are first
      removed. Decimal digits are handled as described above for (h), but in
      this case that number of trailing components is preserved instead of the
      default 1; 0 is treated the same as 1.</dd>
  <dt id="u"><a class="permalink" href="#u"><b>u</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Convert the words to all uppercase.</dd>
  <dt id="x~4"><a class="permalink" href="#x~4"><b>x</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Like <b>q</b>, but break into words at whitespace. Does not work with
      parameter expansion.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <b>s/</b><i>l</i><b>/</b><i>r</i><b>/</b> substitution works
    as follows. By default the left-hand side of substitutions are not patterns,
    but character strings. Any character can be used as the delimiter in place
    of `<b>/</b>'. A backslash quotes the delimiter character. The character
    `<b>&amp;</b>', in the right-hand-side <i>r</i>, is replaced by the text
    from the left-hand-side <i>l</i>. The `<b>&amp;</b>' can be quoted with a
    backslash. A null <i>l</i> uses the previous string either from the previous
    <i>l</i> or from the contextual scan string <i>s</i> from
    `<b>!?</b><i>s</i>'. You can omit the rightmost delimiter if a newline
    immediately follows <i>r</i>; the rightmost `<b>?</b>' in a context scan can
    similarly be omitted. Note the same record of the last <i>l</i> and <i>r</i>
    is maintained across all forms of expansion.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that if a `<b>&amp;</b>' is used within glob qualifiers an
    extra backslash is needed as a <b>&amp;</b> is a special character in this
    case.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also note that the order of expansions affects the interpretation
    of <i>l</i> and <i>r</i>. When used in a history expansion, which occurs
    before any other expansions, <i>l</i> and <i>r</i> are treated as literal
    strings (except as explained for <b>HIST_SUBST_PATTERN</b> below). When used
    in parameter expansion, the replacement of <i>r</i> into the parameter's
    value is done first, and then any additional process, parameter, command,
    arithmetic, or brace references are applied, which may evaluate those
    substitutions and expansions more than once if <i>l</i> appears more than
    once in the starting value. When used in a glob qualifier, any substitutions
    or expansions are performed once at the time the qualifier is parsed, even
    before the `<b>:s</b>' expression itself is divided into <i>l</i> and
    <i>r</i> sides.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the option <b>HIST_SUBST_PATTERN</b> is set, <i>l</i> is
    treated as a pattern of the usual form described in the section FILENAME
    GENERATION below. This can be used in all the places where modifiers are
    available; note, however, that in globbing qualifiers parameter substitution
    has already taken place, so parameters in the replacement string should be
    quoted to ensure they are replaced at the correct time. Note also that
    complicated patterns used in globbing qualifiers may need the extended glob
    qualifier notation <b>(#q:s/</b><i>...</i><b>/</b><i>...</i><b>/)</b> in
    order for the shell to recognize the expression as a glob qualifier.
    Further, note that bad patterns in the substitution are not subject to the
    <b>NO_BAD_PATTERN</b> option so will cause an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>HIST_SUBST_PATTERN</b> is set, <i>l</i> may start with a
    <b>#</b> to indicate that the pattern must match at the start of the string
    to be substituted, and a <b>%</b> may appear at the start or after an
    <b>#</b> to indicate that the pattern must match at the end of the string to
    be substituted. The <b>%</b> or <b>#</b> may be quoted with two
  backslashes.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the following piece of filename generation code with
    the <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> option:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>print -r -- *.c(#q:s/#%(#b)s(*).c/'S${match[1]}.C'/)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">takes the expansion of <b>*.c</b> and applies the glob qualifiers
    in the <b>(#q</b><i>...</i><b>)</b> expression, which consists of a
    substitution modifier anchored to the start and end of each word
    (<b>#%</b>). This turns on backreferences (<b>(#b)</b>), so that the
    parenthesised subexpression is available in the replacement string as
    <b>${match[1]}</b>. The replacement string is quoted so that the parameter
    is not substituted before the start of filename generation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following <b>f</b>, <b>F</b>, <b>w</b> and <b>W</b> modifiers
    work only with parameter expansion and filename generation. They are listed
    here to provide a single point of reference for all modifiers.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>f</b></dt>
  <dd>Repeats the immediately (without a colon) following modifier until the

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PROCESS_SUBSTITUTION"><a class="permalink" href="#PROCESS_SUBSTITUTION">PROCESS
  SUBSTITUTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Each part of a command argument that takes the form
    `<b>&lt;(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b>', `<b>&gt;(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b>' or
    `<b>=(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b>' is subject to process substitution. The
    expression may be preceded or followed by other strings except that, to
    prevent clashes with commonly occurring strings and patterns, the last form
    must occur at the start of a command argument, and the forms are only
    expanded when first parsing command or assignment arguments. Process
    substitutions may be used following redirection operators; in this case, the
    substitution must appear with no trailing string.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that `<b>&lt;&lt;(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b>' is not a special
    syntax; it is equivalent to `<b>&lt; &lt;(</b><i>list</i><b>)</b>',
    redirecting standard input from the result of process substitution. Hence
    all the following documentation applies. The second form (with the space) is
    recommended for clarity.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the case of the <b>&lt;</b> or <b>&gt;</b> forms, the shell
    runs the commands in <i>list</i> as a subprocess of the job executing the
    shell command line. If the system supports the <b>/dev/fd</b> mechanism, the
    command argument is the name of the device file corresponding to a file
    descriptor; otherwise, if the system supports named pipes (FIFOs), the
    command argument will be a named pipe. If the form with <b>&gt;</b> is
    selected then writing on this special file will provide input for
    <i>list</i>. If <b>&lt;</b> is used, then the file passed as an argument
    will be connected to the output of the <i>list</i> process. For example,</p>

<p class="Pp">cuts fields 1 and 3 from the files <i>file1</i> and <i>file2</i>
    respectively, pastes the results together, and sends it to the processes
    <i>process1</i> and <i>process2</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>=(</b><i>...</i><b>)</b> is used instead of
    <b>&lt;(</b><i>...</i><b>)</b>, then the file passed as an argument will be
    the name of a temporary file containing the output of the <i>list</i>
    process. This may be used instead of the <b>&lt;</b> form for a program that
    expects to lseek (see <i>lseek</i>(2)) on the input file.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is an optimisation for substitutions of the form
    <b>=(&lt;&lt;&lt;</b><i>arg</i><b>)</b>, where <i>arg</i> is a single-word
    argument to the here-string redirection <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;</b>. This form
    produces a file name containing the value of <i>arg</i> after any
    substitutions have been performed. This is handled entirely within the
    current shell. This is effectively the reverse of the special form
    <b>$(&lt;</b><i>arg</i><b>)</b> which treats <i>arg</i> as a file name and
    replaces it with the file's contents.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>=</b> form is useful as both the <b>/dev/fd</b> and the
    named pipe implementation of <b>&lt;(</b><i>...</i><b>)</b> have drawbacks.
    In the former case, some programmes may automatically close the file
    descriptor in question before examining the file on the command line,
    particularly if this is necessary for security reasons such as when the
    programme is running setuid. In the second case, if the programme does not
    actually open the file, the subshell attempting to read from or write to the
    pipe will (in a typical implementation, different operating systems may have
    different behaviour) block for ever and have to be killed explicitly. In
    both cases, the shell actually supplies the information using a pipe, so
    that programmes that expect to lseek (see <i>lseek</i>(2)) on the file will
    not work.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also note that the previous example can be more compactly and
    efficiently written (provided the <b>MULTIOS</b> option is set) as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b></b><b>paste &lt;(cut -f1</b><b> </b><i>file1</i><b></b><b>) &lt;(cut -f3</b><b> </b><i>file2</i><b></b><b>)</b><b> \ </b>
<b></b><b>&gt; &gt;(</b><b></b><i>process1</i><b></b><b>) &gt; &gt;(</b><b></b><i>process2</i><b></b><b>)</b><b></b><b></b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The shell uses pipes instead of FIFOs to implement the latter two
    process substitutions in the above example.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is an additional problem with
    <b>&gt;(</b><i>process</i><b>)</b>; when this is attached to an external
    command, the parent shell does not wait for <i>process</i> to finish and
    hence an immediately following command cannot rely on the results being
    complete. The problem and solution are the same as described in the section
    <i>MULTIOS</i> in <i>zshmisc</i>(1). Hence in a simplified version of the
    example above:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b></b><b>paste &lt;(cut -f1</b><b> </b><i>file1</i><b></b><b>) &lt;(cut -f3</b><b> </b><i>file2</i><b></b><b>)</b><b> </b><b>&gt; &gt;(</b><b></b><i>process</i><b></b><b>)</b><b></b><b></b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">(note that no <b>MULTIOS</b> are involved), <i>process</i> will be
    run asynchronously as far as the parent shell is concerned. The workaround
    is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b></b><b>{ paste &lt;(cut -f1</b><b> </b><i>file1</i><b></b><b>) &lt;(cut -f3</b><b> </b><i>file2</i><b></b><b>) }</b><b> </b><b>&gt; &gt;(</b><b></b><i>process</i><b></b><b>)</b><b></b><b></b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The extra processes here are spawned from the parent shell which
    will wait for their completion.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another problem arises any time a job with a substitution that
    requires a temporary file is disowned by the shell, including the case where
    `<b>&amp;!</b>' or `<b>&amp;|</b>' appears at the end of a command
    containing a substitution. In that case the temporary file will not be
    cleaned up as the shell no longer has any memory of the job. A workaround is
    to use a subshell, for example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>(mycmd =(myoutput)) &amp;!</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">as the forked subshell will wait for the command to finish then
    remove the temporary file.</p>
<p class="Pp">A general workaround to ensure a process substitution endures for
    an appropriate length of time is to pass it as a parameter to an anonymous
    shell function (a piece of shell code that is run immediately with function
    scope). For example, this code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>() {</b>
<b>   print File $1:</b>
<b>   cat $1</b>
<b>} =(print This be the verse)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">outputs something resembling the following</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>File /tmp/zsh6nU0kS:</b>
<b>This be the verse</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The temporary file created by the process substitution will be
    deleted when the function exits.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PARAMETER_EXPANSION"><a class="permalink" href="#PARAMETER_EXPANSION">PARAMETER
  EXPANSION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The character `<b>$</b>' is used to introduce parameter
    expansions. See <i>zshparam</i>(1) for a description of parameters,
    including arrays, associative arrays, and subscript notation to access
    individual array elements.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note in particular the fact that words of unquoted parameters are
    not automatically split on whitespace unless the option <b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b>
    is set; see references to this option below for more details. This is an
    important difference from other shells. However, as in other shells, null
    words are elided from unquoted parameters' expansions.</p>
<p class="Pp">With default options, after the assignments:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>array=(&quot;first word&quot; &quot;&quot; &quot;third word&quot;)</b>
<b>scalar=&quot;only word&quot;</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">then <b>$array</b> substitutes two words, `<b>first word</b>' and
    `<b>third</b> <b>word</b>', and <b>$scalar</b> substitutes a single word
    `<b>only word</b>'. Note that second element of <b>array</b> was elided.
    Scalar parameters can be elided too if their value is null (empty). To avoid
    elision, use quoting as follows: <b>&quot;$scalar&quot;</b> for scalars and
    <b>&quot;${array[@]}&quot;</b> or <b>&quot;${(@)array}&quot;</b> for arrays.
    (The last two forms are equivalent.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Parameter expansions can involve <i>flags</i>, as in
    `<b>${(@kv)aliases}</b>', and other operators, such as
    `<b>${PREFIX:-&quot;/usr/local&quot;}</b>'. Parameter expansions can also be
    nested. These topics will be introduced below. The full rules are
    complicated and are noted at the end.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the expansions discussed below that require a pattern, the form
    of the pattern is the same as that used for filename generation; see the
    section `Filename Generation'. Note that these patterns, along with the
    replacement text of any substitutions, are themselves subject to parameter
    expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion. In addition to
    the following operations, the colon modifiers described in the section
    `Modifiers' in the section `History Expansion' can be applied: for example,
    <b>${i:s/foo/bar/}</b> performs string substitution on the expansion of
    parameter <b>$i</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the following descriptions, `<i>word</i>' refers to a single
    word substituted on the command line, not necessarily a space delimited
    word.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>${</b><i>name</i><b>}</b></dt>
  <dd>The value, if any, of the parameter <i>name</i> is substituted. The braces
      are required if the expansion is to be followed by a letter, digit, or
      underscore that is not to be interpreted as part of <i>name</i>. In
      addition, more complicated forms of substitution usually require the
      braces to be present; exceptions, which only apply if the option
      <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> is not set, are a single subscript or any colon
      modifiers appearing after the name, or any of the characters `<b>^</b>',
      `<b>=</b>', `<b>~</b>', `<b>#</b>' or `<b>+</b>' appearing before the
      name, all of which work with or without braces.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If <i>name</i> is an array parameter, and the <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b>
    option is not set, then the value of each element of <i>name</i> is
    substituted, one element per word. Otherwise, the expansion results in one
    word only; with <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b>, this is the first element of an array. No
    field splitting is done on the result unless the <b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b> option
    is set. See also the flags <b>=</b> and <b>s:</b><i>string</i><b>:</b>.</p>

      instead return to the prompt. If <i>word</i> is omitted, then a standard

<p class="Pp">In any of the above expressions that test a variable and

<p class="Pp">In the following expressions, when <i>name</i> is an array and the

  <dt><b>${</b><i>name</i><b>:</b><i>offset</i><b>:</b><i>length</i><b>}</b></dt>
  <dd>This syntax gives effects similar to parameter subscripting in the form
      <b>$</b><i>name</i><b>[</b><i>start</i><b>,</b><i>end</i><b>]</b>, but is
      compatible with other shells; note that both <i>offset</i> and
      <i>length</i> are interpreted differently from the components of a
      subscript.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If <i>offset</i> is non-negative, then if the variable <i>name</i>
    is a scalar substitute the contents starting <i>offset</i> characters from
    the first character of the string, and if <i>name</i> is an array substitute
    elements starting <i>offset</i> elements from the first element. If
    <i>length</i> is given, substitute that many characters or elements,
    otherwise the entire rest of the scalar or array.</p>
<p class="Pp">A positive <i>offset</i> is always treated as the offset of a
    character or element in <i>name</i> from the first character or element of
    the array (this is different from native zsh subscript notation). Hence 0
    refers to the first character or element regardless of the setting of the
    option <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">A negative offset counts backwards from the end of the scalar or
    array, so that -1 corresponds to the last character or element, and so
  on.</p>
<p class="Pp">When positive, <i>length</i> counts from the <i>offset</i>
    position toward the end of the scalar or array. When negative, <i>length</i>
    counts back from the end. If this results in a position smaller than
    <i>offset</i>, a diagnostic is printed and nothing is substituted.</p>
<p class="Pp">The option <b>MULTIBYTE</b> is obeyed, i.e. the offset and length
    count multibyte characters where appropriate.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>offset</i> and <i>length</i> undergo the same set of shell
    substitutions as for scalar assignment; in addition, they are then subject
    to arithmetic evaluation. Hence, for example</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>print ${foo:3}</b>
<b>print ${foo: 1 + 2}</b>
<b>print ${foo:$(( 1 + 2))}</b>
<b>print ${foo:$(echo 1 + 2)}</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">all have the same effect, extracting the string starting at the
    fourth character of <b>$foo</b> if the substitution would otherwise return a
    scalar, or the array starting at the fourth element if <b>$foo</b> would
    return an array. Note that with the option <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> <b>$foo</b>
    always returns a scalar (regardless of the use of the offset syntax) and a
    form such as <b>${foo[*]:3}</b> is required to extract elements of an array
    named <b>foo</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>offset</i> is negative, the <b>-</b> may not appear
    immediately after the <b>:</b> as this indicates the
    <b>${</b><i>name</i><b>:-</b><i>word</i><b>}</b> form of substitution.
    Instead, a space may be inserted before the <b>-</b>. Furthermore, neither
    <i>offset</i> nor <i>length</i> may begin with an alphabetic character or
    <b>&amp;</b> as these are used to indicate history-style modifiers. To
    substitute a value from a variable, the recommended approach is to precede
    it with a <b>$</b> as this signifies the intention (parameter substitution
    can easily be rendered unreadable); however, as arithmetic substitution is
    performed, the expression <b>${var: offs}</b> does work, retrieving the
    offset from <b>$offs</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For further compatibility with other shells there is a special
    case for array offset 0. This usually accesses the first element of the
    array. However, if the substitution refers to the positional parameter
    array, e.g. <b>$@</b> or <b>$*</b>, then offset 0 instead refers to
    <b>$0</b>, offset 1 refers to <b>$1</b>, and so on. In other words, the
    positional parameter array is effectively extended by prepending <b>$0</b>.
    Hence <b>${*:0:1}</b> substitutes <b>$0</b> and <b>${*:1:1}</b> substitutes
    <b>$1</b>.</p>

      the usual rule that pattern characters in <b>$opat</b> are not treated

<p class="Pp">If, after quoting rules apply, <b>${</b><i>name</i><b>}</b>

  <dt><b>${~</b><i>spec</i><b>}</b></dt>
  <dd>Turn on the <b>GLOB_SUBST</b> option for the evaluation of <i>spec</i>; if
      the `<b>~</b>' is doubled, turn it off. When this option is set, the
      string resulting from the expansion will be interpreted as a pattern
      anywhere that is possible, such as in filename expansion and filename
      generation and pattern-matching contexts like the right hand side of the
      `<b>=</b>' and `<b>!=</b>' operators in conditions.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">In nested substitutions, note that the effect of the <b>~</b>
    applies to the result of the current level of substitution. A surrounding
    pattern operation on the result may cancel it. Hence, for example, if the
    parameter <b>foo</b> is set to <b>*</b>, <b>${~foo//\*/*.c}</b> is
    substituted by the pattern <b>*.c</b>, which may be expanded by filename
    generation, but <b>${${~foo}//\*/*.c}</b> substitutes to the string
    <b>*.c</b>, which will not be further expanded.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If a <b>${</b>...<b>}</b> type parameter expression or a
    <b>$(</b>...<b>)</b> type command substitution is used in place of
    <i>name</i> above, it is expanded first and the result is used as if it were
    the value of <i>name</i>. Thus it is possible to perform nested operations:
    <b>${${foo#head}%tail}</b> substitutes the value of <b>$foo</b> with both
    `<b>head</b>' and `<b>tail</b>' deleted. The form with <b>$(</b>...<b>)</b>
    is often useful in combination with the flags described next; see the
    examples below. Each <i>name</i> or nested <b>${</b>...<b>}</b> in a
    parameter expansion may also be followed by a subscript expression as
    described in <i>Array Parameters</i> in <i>zshparam</i>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that double quotes may appear around nested expressions, in
    which case only the part inside is treated as quoted; for example,
    <b>${(f)&quot;$(foo)&quot;}</b> quotes the result of <b>$(foo)</b>, but the
    flag `<b>(f)</b>' (see below) is applied using the rules for unquoted
    expansions. Note further that quotes are themselves nested in this context;
    for example, in <b>&quot;${(@f)&quot;$(foo)&quot;}&quot;</b>, there are two
    sets of quotes, one surrounding the whole expression, the other (redundant)
    surrounding the <b>$(foo)</b> as before.</p>

<p class="Pp">If the opening brace is directly followed by an opening
    parenthesis, the string up to the matching closing parenthesis will be taken
    as a list of flags. In cases where repeating a flag is meaningful, the
    repetitions need not be consecutive; for example, `(<b>q%q%q</b>)' means the
    same thing as the more readable `(<b>%%qqq</b>)'. The following flags are
    supported:</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If the <b>MULTIBYTE</b> option is set and the number is greater

  <dt><b>%</b></dt>
  <dd>Expand all <b>%</b> escapes in the resulting words in the same way as in

      depending on the setting of the <b>PROMPT_PERCENT</b>, <b>PROMPT_SUBST</b>
      and <b>PROMPT_BANG</b> options.</dd>
  <dt><b>@</b></dt>
  <dd>In double quotes, array elements are put into separate words. E.g.,
      `<b>&quot;${(@)foo}&quot;</b>' is equivalent to
      `<b>&quot;${foo[@]}&quot;</b>' and `<b>&quot;${(@)foo[1,2]}&quot;</b>' is
      the same as `<b>&quot;$foo[1]&quot; &quot;$foo[2]&quot;</b>'. This is
      distinct from <i>field splitting</i> by the <b>f</b>, <b>s</b> or <b>z</b>

  <dt id="A~2"><a class="permalink" href="#A~2"><b>A</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Convert the substitution into an array expression, even if it otherwise
      would be scalar. This has lower precedence than subscripting, so one level
      of nested expansion is required in order that subscripts apply to array

      full value of <i>name</i> when <i>name</i> is scalar.</dd>

    `<b>AA</b>'), assigns an associative array parameter. Assignment is made
    before sorting or padding; if field splitting is active, the <i>word</i>
    part is split before assignment. The <i>name</i> part may be a subscripted
    range for ordinary arrays; when assigning an associative array, the
    <i>word</i> part <i>must</i> be converted to an array, for example by using
    `<b>${(AA)=</b><i>name</i><b>=</b>...<b>}</b>' to activate field

<p class="Pp">Here is a summary of the rules for substitution; this assumes that
    braces are present around the substitution, i.e.
    <b>${</b><i>...</i><b>}</b>. Some particular examples are given below. Note
    that the Zsh Development Group accepts <i>no responsibility</i> for any
    brain damage which may occur during the reading of the following rules.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>1.</b> <i>Nested substitution</i></dt>
  <dd>If multiple nested <b>${</b><i>...</i><b>}</b> forms are present,
      substitution is performed from the inside outwards. At each level, the
      substitution takes account of whether the current value is a scalar or an
      array, whether the whole substitution is in double quotes, and what flags
      are supplied to the current level of substitution, just as if the nested
      substitution were the outermost. The flags are not propagated up to
      enclosing substitutions; the nested substitution will return either a
      scalar or an array as determined by the flags, possibly adjusted for
      quoting. All the following steps take place where applicable at all levels
      of substitution.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Note that, unless the `<b>(P)</b>' flag is present, the flags and
    any subscripts apply directly to the value of the nested substitution; for
    example, the expansion <b>${${foo}}</b> behaves exactly the same as
    <b>${foo}</b>. When the `<b>(P)</b>' flag is present in a nested
    substitution, the other substitution rules are applied to the value
    <i>before</i> it is interpreted as a name, so <b>${${(P)foo}}</b> may differ
    from <b>${(P)foo}</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">At each nested level of substitution, the substituted words
    undergo all forms of single-word substitution (i.e. not filename
    generation), including command substitution, arithmetic expansion and
    filename expansion (i.e. leading <b>~</b> and <b>=</b>). Thus, for example,
    <b>${${:-=cat}:h}</b> expands to the directory where the <b>cat</b> program
    resides. (Explanation: the internal substitution has no parameter but a
    default value <b>=cat</b>, which is expanded by filename expansion to a full
    path; the outer substitution then applies the modifier <b>:h</b> and takes
    the directory part of the path.)</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>2.</b> <i>Internal parameter flags</i></dt>
  <dd>Any parameter flags set by one of the <b>typeset</b> family of commands,
      in particular the <b>-L</b>, <b>-R</b>, <b>-Z</b>, <b>-u</b> and <b>-l</b>
      options for padding and capitalization, are applied directly to the
      parameter value. Note these flags are options to the command, e.g.
      `<b>typeset -Z</b>'; they are not the same as the flags used within
      parameter substitutions.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">At the outermost level of substitution, the `<b>(P)</b>' flag
    (rule <b>4.</b>) ignores these transformations and uses the unmodified value
    of the parameter as the name to be replaced. This is usually the desired
    behavior because padding may make the value syntactically illegal as a
    parameter name, but if capitalization changes are desired, use the
    <b>${${(P)foo}}</b> form (rule <b>25.</b>).</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>3.</b> <i>Parameter subscripting</i></dt>
  <dd>If the value is a raw parameter reference with a subscript, such as
      <b>${</b><i>var</i><b>[3]}</b>, the effect of subscripting is applied
      directly to the parameter. Subscripts are evaluated left to right;
      subsequent subscripts apply to the scalar or array value yielded by the
      previous subscript. Thus if <b>var</b> is an array, <b>${var[1][2]}</b> is
      the second character of the first word, but <b>${var[2,4][2]}</b> is the
      entire third word (the second word of the range of words two through four
      of the original array). Any number of subscripts may appear. Flags such as
      `<b>(k)</b>' and `<b>(v)</b>' which alter the result of subscripting are
      applied.</dd>
  <dt><b>4.</b> <i>Parameter name replacement</i></dt>
  <dd>At the outermost level of nesting only, the `<b>(P)</b>' flag is applied.
      This treats the value so far as a parameter name (which may include a
      subscript expression) and replaces that with the corresponding value. This
      replacement occurs later if the `<b>(P)</b>' flag appears in a nested
      substitution.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If the value so far names a parameter that has internal flags
    (rule <b>2.</b>), those internal flags are applied to the new value after
    replacement.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>5.</b> <i>Double-quoted joining</i></dt>
  <dd>If the value after this process is an array, and the substitution appears
      in double quotes, and neither an `<b>(@)</b>' flag nor a `<b>#</b>' length
      operator is present at the current level, then words of the value are
      joined with the first character of the parameter <b>$IFS</b>, by default a
      space, between each word (single word arrays are not modified). If the
      `<b>(j)</b>' flag is present, that is used for joining instead of
      <b>$IFS</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>6.</b> <i>Nested subscripting</i></dt>
  <dd>Any remaining subscripts (i.e. of a nested substitution) are evaluated at
      this point, based on whether the value is an array or a scalar. As with
      <b>3.</b>, multiple subscripts can appear. Note that <b>${foo[2,4][2]}</b>
      is thus equivalent to <b>${${foo[2,4]}[2]}</b> and also to
      <b>&quot;${${(@)foo[2,4]}[2]}&quot;</b> (the nested substitution returns
      an array in both cases), but not to <b>&quot;${${foo[2,4]}[2]}&quot;</b>
      (the nested substitution returns a scalar because of the quotes).</dd>
  <dt><b>7.</b> <i>Modifiers</i></dt>
  <dd>Any modifiers, as specified by a trailing `<b>#</b>', `<b>%</b>',
      `<b>/</b>' (possibly doubled) or by a set of modifiers of the form
      `<b>:...</b>' (see the section `Modifiers' in the section `History
      Expansion'), are applied to the words of the value at this level.</dd>
  <dt><b>8.</b> <i>Character evaluation</i></dt>
  <dd>Any `<b>(#)</b>' flag is applied, evaluating the result so far numerically
      as a character.</dd>
  <dt><b>9.</b> <i>Length</i></dt>
  <dd>Any initial `<b>#</b>' modifier, i.e. in the form
      <b>${#</b><i>var</i><b>}</b>, is used to evaluate the length of the
      expression so far.</dd>
  <dt><b>10.</b> <i>Forced joining</i></dt>
  <dd>If the `<b>(j)</b>' flag is present, or no `<b>(j)</b>' flag is present
      but the string is to be split as given by rule <b>11.</b>, and joining did
      not take place at rule <b>5.</b>, any words in the value are joined
      together using the given string or the first character of <b>$IFS</b> if
      none. Note that the `<b>(F)</b>' flag implicitly supplies a string for
      joining in this manner.</dd>
  <dt><b>11.</b> <i>Simple word splitting</i></dt>
  <dd>If one of the `<b>(s)</b>' or `<b>(f)</b>' flags are present, or the
      `<b>=</b>' specifier was present (e.g. <b>${=</b><i>var</i><b>}</b>), the
      word is split on occurrences of the specified string, or (for <b>=</b>
      with neither of the two flags present) any of the characters in

      quotation marks and other metacharacters are used to decide what
      constitutes a word. Note this form of splitting is entirely distinct from
      that described by rule <b>11.</b>: it does not use <b>$IFS</b>, and does
      not cause forced joining.</dd>
  <dt><b>18.</b> <i>Uniqueness</i></dt>
  <dd>If the result is an array and the `<b>(u)</b>' flag was present, duplicate
      elements are removed from the array.</dd>
  <dt><b>19.</b> <i>Ordering</i></dt>

      `<b>(O)</b>' flags was present, the array is reordered.</dd>

  <dd>At this point the decision is made whether any resulting array elements
      are to be combined element by element with surrounding text, as given by
      either the <b>RC_EXPAND_PARAM</b> option or the `<b>^</b>' flag.</dd>
  <dt><b>21.</b> <i>Re-evaluation</i></dt>
  <dd>Any `<b>(e)</b>' flag is applied to the value, forcing it to be
      re-examined for new parameter substitutions, but also for command and
      arithmetic substitutions.</dd>
  <dt><b>22.</b> <i>Padding</i></dt>
  <dd>Any padding of the value by the `<b>(l.</b><i>fill</i><b>.)</b>' or
      `<b>(r.</b><i>fill</i><b>.)</b>' flags is applied.</dd>
  <dt><b>23.</b> <i>Semantic joining</i></dt>
  <dd>In contexts where expansion semantics requires a single word to result,
      all words are rejoined with the first character of <b>IFS</b> between. So
      in `<b>${(P</b><b>)${(f</b><b>)lines}}</b>' the value of <b>${lines}</b>
      is split at newlines, but then must be joined again before the
      `<b>(P)</b>' flag can be applied.</dd>

<p class="Pp">The flag <b>f</b> is useful to split a double-quoted substitution
    line by line. For example,
    <b>${(f)&quot;$(&lt;</b><i>file</i><b>)&quot;}</b> substitutes the contents
    of <i>file</i> divided so that each line is an element of the resulting
    array. Compare this with the effect of
    <b>$</b><b>(&lt;</b><i>file</i><b>)</b> alone, which divides the file up by
    words, or the same inside double quotes, which makes the entire content of
    the file a single string.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following illustrates the rules for nested parameter
    expansions. Suppose that <b>$foo</b> contains the array <b>(bar
    baz</b><b>)</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>&quot;${(@)${foo}[1]}&quot;</b></dt>
  <dd>This produces the result <b>b</b>. First, the inner substitution
      <b>&quot;${foo}&quot;</b>, which has no array (<b>@</b>) flag, produces a
      single word result <b>&quot;bar baz&quot;</b>. The outer substitution
      <b>&quot;${(@)...[1]}&quot;</b> detects that this is a scalar, so that
      (despite the `<b>(@)</b>' flag) the subscript picks the first
    character.</dd>
  <dt><b>&quot;${${(@)foo}[1]}&quot;</b></dt>
  <dd>This produces the result `<b>bar</b>'. In this case, the inner
      substitution <b>&quot;${(@)foo}&quot;</b> produces the array `<b>(bar
      baz</b><b>)</b>'. The outer substitution <b>&quot;${...[1]}&quot;</b>
      detects that this is an array and picks the first word. This is similar to
      the simple case <b>&quot;${foo[1]}&quot;</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">As an example of the rules for word splitting and joining, suppose
    <b>$foo</b> contains the array `<b>(ax1 bx1</b><b>)</b>'. Then</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>${(s/x/)foo}</b></dt>

  <dt><b>${(s/x/)foo%%1*}</b></dt>
  <dd>produces `<b>a</b>' and `<b> b</b>' (note the extra space). As
      substitution occurs before either joining or splitting, the operation
      first generates the modified array <b>(ax bx</b><b>)</b>, which is joined
      to give <b>&quot;ax bx&quot;</b>, and then split to give `<b>a</b>', `<b>

    slightly different from simply swapping <i>n1</i> and <i>n2</i> in the case
    that the step <i>n3</i> doesn't evenly divide the range. Zero padding can be
    specified in any of the three numbers, specifying it in the third can be
    useful to pad for example `<b>{-99..100..01}</b>' which is not possible to
    specify by putting a 0 on either of the first two numbers (i.e. pad to two
    characters).</p>
<p class="Pp">An expression of the form
    `<b>{</b><i>c1</i><b>..</b><i>c2</i><b>}</b>', where <i>c1</i> and <i>c2</i>
    are single characters (which may be multibyte characters), is expanded to
    every character in the range from <i>c1</i> to <i>c2</i> in whatever
    character sequence is used internally. For characters with code points below
    128 this is US ASCII (this is the only case most users will need). If any
    intervening character is not printable, appropriate quotation is used to
    render it printable. If the character sequence is reversed, the output is in
    reverse order, e.g. `<b>{d..a}</b>' is substituted as `<b>d c b a</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a brace expression matches none of the above forms, it is left
    unchanged, unless the option <b>BRACE_CCL</b> (an abbreviation for `brace
    character class') is set. In that case, it is expanded to a list of the
    individual characters between the braces sorted into the order of the
    characters in the ASCII character set (multibyte characters are not
    currently handled). The syntax is similar to a <b>[</b>...<b>]</b>
    expression in filename generation: `<b>-</b>' is treated specially to denote
    a range of characters, but `<b>^</b>' or `<b>!</b>' as the first character
    is treated normally. For example, `<b>{abcdef0-9}</b>' expands to 16 words
    <b>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that brace expansion is not part of filename generation
    (globbing); an expression such as <b>*/{foo,bar}</b> is split into two
    separate words <b>*/foo</b> and <b>*/bar</b> before filename generation
    takes place. In particular, note that this is liable to produce a `no match'
    error if <i>either</i> of the two expressions does not match; this is to be
    contrasted with <b>*/(foo|bar)</b>, which is treated as a single pattern but
    otherwise has similar effects.</p>

    <b>${^</b><i>spec</i><b>}</b> form described in the section Parameter
    Expansion above.</p>

<p class="Pp">If the function <b>zsh_directory_name</b> exists, or the shell
    variable <b>zsh_directory_name_functions</b> exists and contains an array of
    function names, then the functions are used to implement dynamic directory
    naming. The functions are tried in order until one returns status zero, so
    it is important that functions test whether they can handle the case in
    question and return an appropriate status.</p>
<p class="Pp">A `<b>~</b>' followed by a string <i>namstr</i> in unquoted square
    brackets is treated specially as a dynamic directory name. Note that the
    first unquoted closing square bracket always terminates <i>namstr</i>. The
    shell function is passed two arguments: the string <b>n</b> (for name) and
    <i>namstr</i>. It should either set the array <b>reply</b> to a single
    element which is the directory corresponding to the name and return status
    zero (executing an assignment as the last statement is usually sufficient),
    or it should return status non-zero. In the former case the element of reply
    is used as the directory; in the latter case the substitution is deemed to
    have failed. If all functions fail and the option <b>NOMATCH</b> is set, an
    error results.</p>
<p class="Pp">The functions defined as above are also used to see if a directory
    can be turned into a name, for example when printing the directory stack or
    when expanding <b>%~</b> in prompts. In this case each function is passed
    two arguments: the string <b>d</b> (for directory) and the candidate for
    dynamic naming. The function should either return non-zero status, if the
    directory cannot be named by the function, or it should set the array reply
    to consist of two elements: the first is the dynamic name for the directory
    (as would appear within `<b>~[</b><i>...</i><b>]</b>'), and the second is
    the prefix length of the directory to be replaced. For example, if the trial
    directory is <b>/home/myname/src/zsh</b> and the dynamic name for
    <b>/home/myname/src</b> (which has 16 characters) is <b>s</b>, then the
    function sets</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>reply=(s 16)</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The directory name so returned is compared with possible static
    names for parts of the directory path, as described below; it is used if the
    prefix length matched (16 in the example) is longer than that matched by any
    static name.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is not a requirement that a function implements both <b>n</b>
    and <b>d</b> calls; for example, it might be appropriate for certain dynamic
    forms of expansion not to be contracted to names. In that case any call with
    the first argument <b>d</b> should cause a non-zero status to be
  returned.</p>
<p class="Pp">The completion system calls `<b>zsh_directory_name c</b>' followed
    by equivalent calls to elements of the array
    <b>zsh_directory_name_functions</b>, if it exists, in order to complete
    dynamic names for directories. The code for this should be as for any other
    completion function as described in <i>zshcompsys</i>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">As a working example, here is a function that expands any dynamic
    names beginning with the string <b>p:</b> to directories below

    are typically home directories for users on the system. They may also be
    defined if the text after the `<b>~</b>' is the name of a string shell

    it has a named directory as its prefix. If so, then the prefix portion is
    replaced with a `<b>~</b>' followed by the name of the directory. The
    shorter of the two ways of referring to the directory is used, i.e. either
    the directory name or the full path; the name is used if they are the same

      not work in filename generation. When a pattern with a set of active
      parentheses is matched, the strings matched by the groups are stored in
      the array <b>$match</b>, the indices of the beginning of the matched
      parentheses in the array <b>$mbegin</b>, and the indices of the end in the
      array <b>$mend</b>, with the first element of each array corresponding to
      the first parenthesised group, and so on. These arrays are not otherwise
      special to the shell. The indices use the same convention as does
      parameter substitution, so that elements of <b>$mend</b> and
      <b>$mbegin</b> may be used in subscripts; the <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b> option is
      respected. Sets of globbing flags are not considered parenthesised groups;
      only the first nine active parentheses can be referenced.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">For example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>foo=&quot;a_string_with_a_message&quot;</b>
<b>if [[ $foo = (a|an)_(#b)(*) ]]; then</b>
<b>  print ${foo[$mbegin[1],$mend[1]]}</b>
<b>fi</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">prints `<b>string_with_a_message</b>'. Note that the first set of
    parentheses is before the <b>(#b)</b> and does not create a
  backreference.</p>
<p class="Pp">Backreferences work with all forms of pattern matching other than
    filename generation, but note that when performing matches on an entire
    array, such as <b>${</b><i>array</i><b>#</b><i>pattern</i><b>}</b>, or a
    global substitution, such as
    <b>${</b><i>param</i><b>//</b><i>pat</i><b>/</b><i>repl</i><b>}</b>, only
    the data for the last match remains available. In the case of global
    replacements this may still be useful. See the example for the <b>m</b> flag
    below.</p>
<p class="Pp">The numbering of backreferences strictly follows the order of the
    opening parentheses from left to right in the pattern string, although sets
    of parentheses may be nested. There are special rules for parentheses
    followed by `<b>#</b>' or `<b>##</b>'. Only the last match of the
    parenthesis is remembered: for example, in `<b>[[ abab = (#b)([ab])#
    ]]</b>', only the final `<b>b</b>' is stored in <b>match[1]</b>. Thus extra
    parentheses may be necessary to match the complete segment: for example, use
    `<b>X((ab|cd)#)Y</b>' to match a whole string of either `<b>ab</b>' or
    `<b>cd</b>' between `<b>X</b>' and `<b>Y</b>', using the value of
    <b>$match[1]</b> rather than <b>$match[2]</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the match fails none of the parameters is altered, so in some
    cases it may be necessary to initialise them beforehand. If some of the
    backreferences fail to match -- which happens if they are in an alternate
    branch which fails to match, or if they are followed by <b>#</b> and matched
    zero times -- then the matched string is set to the empty string, and the
    start and end indices are set to -1.</p>
<p class="Pp">Pattern matching with backreferences is slightly slower than
    without.</p>

      where `<b>/</b>' has special meaning; it cannot be combined with other
      globbing flags and a bad pattern error occurs if it is misplaced. It is
      equivalent to the form <b>{</b><i>N</i><b>,</b><i>M</i><b>}</b> in regular
      expressions. The previous character or group is required to match between
      <i>N</i> and <i>M</i> times, inclusive. The form
      <b>(#c</b><i>N</i><b>)</b> requires exactly <b>N</b> matches;
      <b>(#c,</b><i>M</i><b>)</b> is equivalent to specifying <i>N</i> as 0;
      <b>(#c</b><i>N</i><b>,)</b> specifies that there is no maximum limit on

  <dd>Set references to the match data for the entire string matched; this is

      be set to the string matched and to the indices of the beginning and end
      of the string, respectively. This is most useful in parameter
      substitutions, as otherwise the string matched is obvious.</dd>

  <dd>Unlike the other flags, these have only a local effect, and each must

      forms. The `<b>(#s)</b>' flag succeeds only at the start of the test
      string, and the `<b>(#e)</b>' flag succeeds only at the end of the test
      string; they correspond to `<b>^</b>' and `<b>$</b>' in standard regular
      expressions. They are useful for matching path segments in patterns other
      than those in filename generation (where path segments are in any case
      treated separately). For example, `<b>*((#s)|/)test((#e)|/)*</b>' matches
      a path segment `<b>test</b>' in any of the following strings: <b>test</b>,
      <b>test/at/start</b>, <b>at/end/test</b>, <b>in/test/middle</b>.</dd>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Another use is in parameter substitution; for example
    `<b>${array/(#s)A*Z(#e)}</b>' will remove only elements of an array which

    many operations of this type, however the combination of the substitution
    operations `<b>/</b>' and `<b>//</b>' with the `<b>(#s)</b>' and
    `<b>(#e)</b>' flags provides a single simple and memorable method.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that assertions of the form `<b>(^(#s))</b>' also work, i.e.
    match anywhere except at the start of the string, although this actually
    means `anything except a zero-length portion at the start of the string';
    you need to use `<b>(&quot;&quot;~(#s))</b>' to match a zero-length portion

  <dd>A `<b>q</b>' and everything up to the closing parenthesis of the globbing

      support the use of glob qualifiers, see below. The result is that the

      matching against a string. In the former case, the `<b>(#q.)</b>' will be
      treated as a glob qualifier and the `<b>(#b)</b>' will not be useful,
      while in the latter case the `<b>(#b)</b>' is useful for backreferences

<p class="Pp">For example, the test string <b>fooxx</b> can be matched by the

    <b>(#i</b><b>)FOO</b><b>(#I</b><b>)XX</b> or
    <b>((#i</b><b>)FOOX</b><b>)X</b>. The string <b>(#ia2</b><b>)readme</b>
    specifies case-insensitive matching of <b>readme</b> with up to two
  errors.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using the ksh syntax for grouping both <b>KSH_GLOB</b> and
    <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> must be set and the left parenthesis should be preceded
    by <b>@</b>. Note also that the flags do not affect letters inside
    <b>[</b>...<b>]</b> groups, in other words <b>(#i</b><b>)[a-z]</b> still
    matches only lowercase letters. Finally, note that when examining whole
    paths case-insensitively every directory must be searched for all files
    which match, so that a pattern of the form <b>(#i</b><b>)/foo/bar/...</b> is
    potentially slow.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Approximate_Matching"><a class="permalink" href="#Approximate_Matching">Approximate
  Matching</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When matching approximately, the shell keeps a count of the errors
    found, which cannot exceed the number specified in the
    <b>(#a</b><i>num</i><b>)</b> flags. Four types of error are recognised:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Different characters, as in <b>fooxbar</b> and <b>fooybar</b>.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Transposition of characters, as in <b>banana</b> and <b>abnana</b>.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>A character missing in the target string, as with the pattern <b>road</b>
      and target string <b>rod</b>.</dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>An extra character appearing in the target string, as with <b>stove</b>
      and <b>strove</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Thus, the pattern <b>(#a3</b><b>)abcd</b> matches <b>dcba</b>,
    with the errors occurring by using the first rule twice and the second once,
    grouping the string as <b>[d][cb][a]</b> and <b>[a][bc][d]</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Non-literal parts of the pattern must match exactly, including
    characters in character ranges: hence <b>(#a1</b><b>)???</b> matches strings
    of length four, by applying rule 4 to an empty part of the pattern, but not
    strings of length two, since all the <b>?</b> must match. Other characters
    which must match exactly are initial dots in filenames (unless the
    <b>GLOB_DOTS</b> option is set), and all slashes in filenames, so that
    <b>a/bc</b> is two errors from <b>ab/c</b> (the slash cannot be transposed
    with another character). Similarly, errors are counted separately for
    non-contiguous strings in the pattern, so that <b>(ab|cd</b><b>)ef</b> is
    two errors from <b>aebf</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using exclusion via the <b>~</b> operator, approximate
    matching is treated entirely separately for the excluded part and must be
    activated separately. Thus, <b>(#a1</b><b>)README~READ_ME</b> matches
    <b>READ.ME</b> but not <b>READ_ME</b>, as the trailing <b>READ_ME</b> is
    matched without approximation. However,
    <b>(#a1</b><b>)README~(#a1</b><b>)READ_ME</b> does not match any pattern of
    the form <b>READ</b><i>?</i><b>ME</b> as all such forms are now
  excluded.</p>
<p class="Pp">Apart from exclusions, there is only one overall error count;
    however, the maximum errors allowed may be altered locally, and this can be
    delimited by grouping. For example,
    <b>(#a1</b><b>)cat</b><b>((#a0</b><b>)dog</b><b>)fox</b> allows one error in
    total, which may not occur in the <b>dog</b> section, and the pattern
    <b>(#a1</b><b>)cat</b><b>(#a0</b><b>)dog</b><b>(#a1</b><b>)fox</b> is
    equivalent. Note that the point at which an error is first found is the
    crucial one for establishing whether to use approximation; for example,
    <b>(#a1)abc(#a0)xyz</b> will not match <b>abcdxyz</b>, because the error
    occurs at the `<b>x</b>', where approximation is turned off.</p>
<p class="Pp">Entire path segments may be matched approximately, so that
    `<b>(#a1)/foo/d/is/available/at/the/bar</b>' allows one error in any path
    segment. This is much less efficient than without the <b>(#a1)</b>, however,
    since every directory in the path must be scanned for a possible approximate
    match. It is best to place the <b>(#a1)</b> after any path segments which
    are known to be correct.</p>

    (potentially including the file `<b>bar</b>' in the current directory). This

    other forms of globbing within the same path segment; in that case, the
    `<b>*</b>' operators revert to their usual effect.</p>
<p class="Pp">Even shorter forms are available when the option
    <b>GLOB_STAR_SHORT</b> is set. In that case if no <b>/</b> immediately

<h2 class="Ss" id="Glob_Qualifiers"><a class="permalink" href="#Glob_Qualifiers">Glob
  Qualifiers</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Patterns used for filename generation may end in a list of
    qualifiers enclosed in parentheses. The qualifiers specify which filenames
    that otherwise match the given pattern will be inserted in the argument
    list.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the option <b>BARE_GLOB_QUAL</b> is set, then a trailing set of
    parentheses containing no `<b>|</b>' or `<b>(</b>' characters (or `<b>~</b>'
    if it is special) is taken as a set of glob qualifiers. A glob subexpression
    that would normally be taken as glob qualifiers, for example `<b>(^x)</b>',
    can be forced to be treated as part of the glob pattern by doubling the
    parentheses, in this case producing `<b>((^x))</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the option <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b> is set, a different syntax for
    glob qualifiers is available, namely `<b>(#q</b><i>x</i><b>)</b>' where
    <i>x</i> is any of the same glob qualifiers used in the other format. The
    qualifiers must still appear at the end of the pattern. However, with this
    syntax multiple glob qualifiers may be chained together. They are treated as
    a logical AND of the individual sets of flags. Also, as the syntax is
    unambiguous, the expression will be treated as glob qualifiers just as long
    any parentheses contained within it are balanced; appearance of `<b>|</b>',
    `<b>(</b>' or `<b>~</b>' does not negate the effect. Note that qualifiers
    will be recognised in this form even if a bare glob qualifier exists at the
    end of the pattern, for example `<b>*(#q*)(.)</b>' will recognise executable
    regular files if both options are set; however, mixed syntax should probably
    be avoided for the sake of clarity. Note that within conditions using the
    `<b>[[</b>' form the presence of a parenthesised expression
    <b>(#q</b><i>...</i><b>)</b> at the end of a string indicates that globbing
    should be performed; the expression may include glob qualifiers, but it is
    also valid if it is simply <b>(#q)</b>. This does not apply to the right
    hand side of pattern match operators as the syntax already has special
    significance.</p>

      file-modes are not checked, this is only useful in combination with
      `<b>=</b>'.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If the qualifier `<b>f</b>' is followed by any other character
    anything up to the next matching character (`<b>[</b>', `<b>{</b>', and

    any other character matches itself) is taken as a list of comma-separated
    <i>sub-spec</i>s. Each <i>sub-spec</i> may be either an octal number as
    described above or a list of any of the characters `<b>u</b>', `<b>g</b>',
    `<b>o</b>', and `<b>a</b>', followed by a `<b>=</b>', a `<b>+</b>', or a
    `<b>-</b>', followed by a list of any of the characters `<b>r</b>',
    `<b>w</b>', `<b>x</b>', `<b>s</b>', and `<b>t</b>', or an octal digit. The
    first list of characters specify which access rights are to be checked. If a
    `<b>u</b>' is given, those for the owner of the file are used, if a
    `<b>g</b>' is given, those of the group are checked, a `<b>o</b>' means to
    test those of other users, and the `<b>a</b>' says to test all three groups.
    The `<b>=</b>', `<b>+</b>', and `<b>-</b>' again says how the modes are to
    be checked and have the same meaning as described for the first form above.
    The second list of characters finally says which access rights are to be
    expected: `<b>r</b>' for read access, `<b>w</b>' for write access,
    `<b>x</b>' for the right to execute the file (or to search a directory),
    `<b>s</b>' for the setuid and setgid bits, and `<b>t</b>' for the sticky
    bit.</p>
<p class="Pp">Thus, `<b>*(f70?)</b>' gives the files for which the owner has
    read, write, and execute permission, and for which other group members have
    no rights, independent of the permissions for other users. The pattern
    `<b>*(f-100)</b>' gives all files for which the owner does not have execute
    permission, and `<b>*(f:gu+w,o-rx:)</b>' gives the files for which the owner

      by the time of the last access, modification, or inode change
      respectively; if <b>d</b>, files in subdirectories appear before those in
      the current directory at each level of the search -- this is best combined
      with other criteria, for example `<b>odon</b>' to sort on names for files
      within the same directory; if <b>N</b>, no sorting is performed. Note that
      <b>a</b>, <b>m</b>, and <b>c</b> compare the age against the current time,
      hence the first name in the list is the youngest file. Also note that the
      modifiers <b>^</b> and <b>-</b> are used, so `<b>*(^-oL)</b>' gives a list
      of all files sorted by file size in descending order, following any
      symbolic links. Unless <b>oN</b> is used, multiple order specifiers may

    which to sort. Unlike other sort operators, <b>oe</b> and <b>o+</b> may be

  <dd>The <i>string</i> will be prepended to each glob match as a separate word.
      <i>string</i> is delimited in the same way as arguments to the <b>e</b>
      glob qualifier described above. The qualifier can be repeated; the words
      are prepended separately so that the resulting command line contains the
      words in the same order they were given in the list of glob
    qualifiers.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">A typical use for this is to prepend an option before all
    occurrences of a file name; for example, the pattern `<b>*(P:-f:)</b>'
    produces the command line arguments `<b>-f</b> <i>file1</i> <b>-f</b>
    <i>file2</i> ...'</p>
<p class="Pp">If the modifier <b>^</b> is active, then <i>string</i> will be
    appended instead of prepended. Prepending and appending is done
    independently so both can be used on the same glob expression; for example
    by writing `<b>*(P:foo:^P:bar:^P:baz:)</b>' which produces the command line
    arguments `<b>foo</b> <b>baz</b> <i>file1</i> <b>bar</b> ...'</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">More than one of these lists can be combined, separated by commas.
    The whole list matches if at least one of the sublists matches (they are
    `or'ed, the qualifiers in the sublists are `and'ed). Some qualifiers,
    however, affect all matches generated, independent of the sublist in which
    they are given. These are the qualifiers `<b>M</b>', `<b>T</b>', `<b>N</b>',
    `<b>D</b>', `<b>n</b>', `<b>o</b>', `<b>O</b>' and the subscripts given in
    brackets (`<b>[</b><i>...</i><b>]</b>').</p>
<p class="Pp">If a `<b>:</b>' appears in a qualifier list, the remainder of the
    expression in parenthesis is interpreted as a modifier (see the section
    `Modifiers' in the section `History Expansion'). Each modifier must be
    introduced by a separate `<b>:</b>'. Note also that the result after
    modification does not have to be an existing file. The name of any existing
    file can be followed by a modifier of the form `<b>(:</b><i>...</i><b>)</b>'
    even if no actual filename generation is performed, although note that the
    presence of the parentheses causes the entire expression to be subjected to
    any global pattern matching options such as <b>NULL_GLOB</b>. Thus:</p>
