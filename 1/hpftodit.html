<p class="Pp"><b>hpftodit</b> creates a font file for use with a Hewlett-Packard
    LaserJet 4&#x2013;series (or newer) printer with <b>groff -Tlj4</b>, using
    data from an HP tagged font metric (TFM) file. <i>tfm_file</i> is the name
    of the TFM file for the font; Intellifont and TrueType TFM files are
    supported, but symbol set TFM files are not. <i>map_file</i> is a file
    giving the groff names for characters in the font; this file should consist
    of a sequence of lines of the form:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><i>m u c1 c2 ... [</i> <span class="Li">#</span> <i>comment</i> ]</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">where <i>m</i> is a decimal integer giving the MSL number of the
    character, <i>u</i> is a hexadecimal integer giving the Unicode value of the
    character, and <i>c1</i>, <i>c2</i>, ... are the groff names of the
    character. The values can be separated by any whitespace; the Unicode value
    must use uppercase digits A&#x2013;F, and must be without a leading
    `<span class="Li">0x</span>', `<span class="Li">u</span>', or
    `<span class="Li">U+</span>'. Unicode values corresponding to composite
    glyphs are decomposed; e.g., `<span class="Li">u00C0</span>' becomes
    `<span class="Li">u0041_0300</span>'. The name for a glyph without a groff
    name may be given as <span class="Li">u</span><i>XXXX</i> if the glyph
    corresponds to a Unicode value, or as an unnamed glyph
    `<span class="Li">---</span>'. If the given Unicode value is in the Private
    Use Area (0xE000&#x2013;0xF8FF), the glyph is included as an unnamed glyph.
    Refer to <b>groff_diff</b>(1) for additional information about unnamed
    glyphs and how to access them.</p>
<p class="Pp">Blank lines and lines beginning with `<span class="Li">#</span>'
    are ignored. A `<span class="Li">#</span>' following one or more groff names
    begins a comment. Because `<span class="Li">#</span>' is a valid groff name,
    it must appear first in a list of groff names if a comment is included,
    e.g.,</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">3 0023 # # number sign</span></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">or</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">3 0023 # sh # number sign</span></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">rather than</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">3 0023 sh # # number sign</span></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">which will treat the first `<span class="Li">#</span>' as the
    beginning of the comment.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>font</i> is the name of the groff font file. The groff font
    file is written to <i>font</i>; if <i>font</i> is specified as
    `<span class="Li">-</span>', the output is written to the standard
  output.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-s</b> option should be given if the font is special (a
    font is <i>special</i> if <b>troff</b> should search it whenever a character
    is not found in the current font). If the font is special, it should be
    listed in the <b>fonts</b> command in the DESC file; if it is not special,
    there is no need to list it, since <b>troff</b> can automatically mount it
    when it's first used.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-i</b> option is used, <b>hpftodit</b> automatically
    will generate an italic correction, a left italic correction and a subscript
    correction for each character (the significance of these parameters is
    explained in <b>groff_font</b>(5)).</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="a"><a class="permalink" href="#a"><b>-a</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Include characters in the TFM file that are not included in the map file.
      A glyph with corresponding Unicode value is given the name u<i>XXXX</i>; a
      glyph without a Unicode value is included as an unnamed glyph `---'. A
      glyph with a Unicode value in the Private Use Area (0xE000&#x2013;0xF8FF)
      also is included as an unnamed glyph.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This option provides a simple means of adding Unicode-named and unnamed
      glyphs to a font without including them in the map file, but it affords
      little control over which glyphs are placed in a regular font and which
      are placed in a special font. The presence or absence of the <b>-s</b>
      option has some effect on which glyphs are included: without the <b>-s</b>
      option, only the &#x201C;text&#x201D; symbol sets are searched for
      matching glyphs; with the <b>-s</b> option, only the
      &#x201C;mathematical&#x201D; symbol sets are searched. Nonetheless,
      restricting the symbol sets searched isn't very selective&#x2014;many
      glyphs are placed in both regular and special fonts. Normally, the
      <b>-a</b> option should be used only as a last resort.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="d"><a class="permalink" href="#d"><b>-d</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Dump information about the TFM file to the standard output; this option
      can be useful for ensuring that a TFM file is a proper match for a font,
      and that the contents of the TFM file are suitable. The information
      includes the values of important TFM tags, and a listing (by MSL number
      for Intellifont TFM files or by Unicode value for TrueType TFM files) of
      the glyphs included in the TFM file. The unit of measure `DU' for some
      tags indicates design units; there are 8782 design units per em for
      Intellifont fonts, and 2048 design units per em for TrueType fonts. Note
      that the accessibility of a glyph depends on its inclusion in a symbol
      set; some TFM files list many glyphs but only a few symbol sets.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The glyph listing includes the glyph index within the TFM file, the MSL or
      Unicode value, and the symbol set and character code that will be used to
      print the glyph. If <i>map_file</i> is given, groff names are given for
      matching glyphs. If only the glyph index and MSL or Unicode value are
      given, the glyph does not appear in any supported symbol set and cannot be
      printed.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>With the <b>-d</b> option, <i>map_file</i> is optional, and <i>font</i> is
      ignored if given.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="q"><a class="permalink" href="#q"><b>-q</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Suppress warnings about characters in the map file that were not found in
      the TFM file. Warnings never are given for unnamed glyphs or by glyphs
      named by their Unicode values. This option is useful when sending the
      output of <b>hpftodit</b> to the standard output.</dd>
  <dt id="v"><a class="permalink" href="#v"><b>-v</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print the <b>hpftodit</b> version number.</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><b>-s</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The font is special. This option adds the <b>special</b> command to the
      font file, and affects the order in which HP symbol sets are searched for
      each glyph. Without the <b>-s</b> option, the &#x201C;text&#x201D; sets
      are searched before the &#x201C;mathematical&#x201D; symbol sets. With the
      <b>-s</b> option, the search order is reversed.</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><b>-i</b><i>n</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Generate an italic correction for each character so that the character's
      width plus the character's italic correction is equal to <i>n</i>
      thousandths of an em plus the amount by which the right edge of the
      character's bounding is to the right of the character's origin. If this
      would result in a negative italic correction, use a zero italic correction
      instead.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Also generate a subscript correction equal to the product of the tangent
      of the slant of the font and four fifths of the x-height of the font. If
      this would result in a subscript correction greater than the italic
      correction, use a subscript correction equal to the italic correction
      instead.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Also generate a left italic correction for each character equal to
      <i>n</i> thousandths of an em plus the amount by which the left edge of
      the character's bounding box is to the left of the character's origin. The
      left italic correction may be negative.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This option normally is needed only with italic or oblique fonts; a value
      of 50 (0.05 em) usually is a reasonable choice.</dd>
