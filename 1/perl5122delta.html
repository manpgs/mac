<p class="Pp">This document describes differences between the 5.12.1 release and
    the 5.12.2 release.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are upgrading from an earlier major version, such as
    5.10.1, first read perl5120delta, which describes differences between 5.10.1
    and 5.12.0, as well as perl5121delta, which describes earlier changes in the
    5.12 stable release series.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;Carp&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Upgraded from version 1.16 to 1.17.
    <p class="Pp">Carp now detects incomplete <b>caller()</b> overrides and
        avoids using bogus <span class="Li">@DB::args</span>. To provide
        backtraces, Carp relies on particular behaviour of the caller built-in.
        Carp now detects if other code has overridden this with an incomplete
        implementation, and modifies its backtrace accordingly. Previously
        incomplete overrides would cause incorrect values in backtraces (best
        case), or obscure fatal errors (worst case)</p>
    <p class="Pp">This fixes certain cases of <span class="Li">&quot;Bizarre
        copy of ARRAY&quot;</span> caused by modules overriding
        <span class="Li">&quot;caller()&quot;</span> incorrectly.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;CPANPLUS&quot;</dt>
  <dd>A patch to <i>cpanp-run-perl</i> has been backported from CPANPLUS
      <span class="Li">0.9004</span>. This resolves RT #55964
      &lt;http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=55964&gt; and RT #57106
      &lt;http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=57106&gt;, both of which
      related to failures to install distributions that use
      <span class="Li">&quot;Module::Install::DSL&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;File::Glob&quot;</dt>
  <dd>A regression which caused a failure to find
      <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::GLOBAL::glob&quot;</span> after loading
      <span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob&quot;</span> to crash has been fixed.
      Now, it correctly falls back to external globbing via
      <span class="Li">&quot;pp_glob&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;File::Copy&quot;</dt>
  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;File::Copy::copy(FILE, DIR)&quot;</span> is now
      documented.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;File::Spec&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Upgraded from version 3.31 to 3.31_01.
    <p class="Pp">Several portability fixes were made in
        <span class="Li">&quot;File::Spec::VMS&quot;</span>: a colon is now
        recognized as a delimiter in native filespecs; caret-escaped delimiters
        are recognized for better handling of extended filespecs;
        <span class="Li">&quot;catpath()&quot;</span> returns an empty directory
        rather than the current directory if the input directory name is empty;
        <span class="Li">&quot;abs2rel()&quot;</span> properly handles
        Unix-style input.</p>

<p class="Pp">If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
    recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
    database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
    http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the
    <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug
    down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the
    output of <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
    a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
