<p class="Pp">The <code class="Dv">SIGALRM</code> signal is not handled

<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">sleep</code> command allows and honors a
    non-integer number of seconds to sleep in any form acceptable by
    <a class="Xr" href="../3/strtod">strtod(3)</a>. This is a non-portable
    extension, but is also implemented in GNU sh-utils since version 2.0a

<p class="Pp">The scenario for a script such as this might be: a program
    currently running is taking longer than expected to process a series of
    files, and it would be nice to have another program start processing the
    files created by the first program as soon as it is finished (when
    zzz.rawdata is created). The script checks every five minutes for the file
    zzz.rawdata, when the file is found, then another portion processing is done
    courteously by sleeping for 70 seconds in between each awk job.</p>
