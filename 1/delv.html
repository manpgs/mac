<p class="Pp"><b>delv</b> (Domain Entity Lookup &amp; Validation) is a tool for
    sending DNS queries and validating the results, using the the same internal
    resolver and validator logic as <b>named</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>delv</b> will send to a specified name server all queries
    needed to fetch and validate the requested data; this includes the original
    requested query, subsequent queries to follow CNAME or DNAME chains, and
    queries for DNSKEY, DS and DLV records to establish a chain of trust for
    DNSSEC validation. It does not perform iterative resolution, but simulates
    the behavior of a name server configured for DNSSEC validating and
    forwarding.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, responses are validated using built-in DNSSEC trust
    anchors for the root zone (&quot;.&quot;) and for the ISC DNSSEC lookaside
    validation zone (&quot;dlv.isc.org&quot;). Records returned by <b>delv</b>
    are either fully validated or were not signed. If validation fails, an
    explanation of the failure is included in the output; the validation process
    can be traced in detail. Because <b>delv</b> does not rely on an external
    server to carry out validation, it can be used to check the validity of DNS
    responses in environments where local name servers may not be
  trustworthy.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless it is told to query a specific name server, <b>delv</b>
    will try each of the servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf. If no usable server
    addresses are found, <b>delv</b> will send queries to the localhost
    addresses (127.0.0.1 for IPv4, ::1 for IPv6).</p>
<p class="Pp">When no command line arguments or options are given, <b>delv</b>
    will perform an NS query for &quot;.&quot; (the root zone).</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SIMPLE_USAGE"><a class="permalink" href="#SIMPLE_USAGE">SIMPLE
  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A typical invocation of <b>delv</b> looks like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<br/>
 delv @server name type 
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">where:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>server</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">is the name or IP address of the name server to query.
  This can be an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in
  colon-delimited notation. When the supplied <i>server</i> argument is a
  hostname, <b>delv</b> resolves that name before querying that name server
  (note, however, that this initial lookup is <i>not</i> validated by DNSSEC).
<p class="Pp">If no <i>server</i> argument is provided, <b>delv</b> consults
    /etc/resolv.conf; if an address is found there, it queries the name server
    at that address. If either of the <b>-4</b> or <b>-6</b> options are in use,
    then only addresses for the corresponding transport will be tried. If no
    usable addresses are found, <b>delv</b> will send queries to the localhost
    addresses (127.0.0.1 for IPv4, ::1 for IPv6).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>name</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">is the domain name to be looked up.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>type</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">indicates what type of query is required &#x2014; ANY, A,
  MX, etc. <i>type</i> can be any valid query type. If no <i>type</i> argument
  is supplied, <b>delv</b> will perform a lookup for an A record.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">-a <i>anchor-file</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies a file from which to read DNSSEC trust anchors.
  The default is /etc/bind.keys, which is included with BIND 9 and contains
  trust anchors for the root zone (&quot;.&quot;) and for the ISC DNSSEC
  lookaside validation zone (&quot;dlv.isc.org&quot;).
<p class="Pp">Keys that do not match the root or DLV trust-anchor names are
    ignored; these key names can be overridden using the <b>+dlv=NAME</b> or
    <b>+root=NAME</b> options.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: When reading the trust anchor file, <b>delv</b> treats
    <b>managed-keys</b> statements and <b>trusted-keys</b> statements
    identically. That is, for a managed key, it is the <i>initial</i> key that
    is trusted; RFC 5011 key management is not supported. <b>delv</b> will not
    consult the managed-keys database maintained by <b>named</b>. This means
    that if either of the keys in /etc/bind.keys is revoked and rolled over, it
    will be necessary to update /etc/bind.keys to use DNSSEC validation in
    <b>delv</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-b <i>address</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sets the source IP address of the query to
  <i>address</i>. This must be a valid address on one of the host's network
  interfaces or &quot;0.0.0.0&quot; or &quot;::&quot;. An optional source port
  may be specified by appending &quot;#&lt;port&gt;&quot;</div>
<p class="Pp">-c <i>class</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sets the query class for the requested data. Currently,
  only class &quot;IN&quot; is supported in <b>delv</b> and any other value is
  ignored.</div>
<p class="Pp">-d <i>level</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the systemwide debug level to <b>level</b>. The
  allowed range is from 0 to 99. The default is 0 (no debugging). Debugging
  traces from <b>delv</b> become more verbose as the debug level increases. See
  the <b>+mtrace</b>, <b>+rtrace</b>, and <b>+vtrace</b> options below for
  additional debugging details.</div>
<p class="Pp">-h</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Display the <b>delv</b> help usage output and exit.</div>
<p class="Pp">-i</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Insecure mode. This disables internal DNSSEC validation.
  (Note, however, this does not set the CD bit on upstream queries. If the
  server being queried is performing DNSSEC validation, then it will not return
  invalid data; this can cause <b>delv</b> to time out. When it is necessary to
  examine invalid data to debug a DNSSEC problem, use <b>dig +cd</b>.)</div>
<p class="Pp">-m</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enables memory usage debugging.</div>
<p class="Pp">-p <i>port#</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies a destination port to use for queries instead
  of the standard DNS port number 53. This option would be used with a name
  server that has been configured to listen for queries on a non-standard port
  number.</div>
<p class="Pp">-q <i>name</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sets the query name to <i>name</i>. While the query name
  can be specified without using the <b>-q</b>, it is sometimes necessary to
  disambiguate names from types or classes (for example, when looking up the
  name &quot;ns&quot;, which could be misinterpreted as the type NS, or
  &quot;ch&quot;, which could be misinterpreted as class CH).</div>
<p class="Pp">-t <i>type</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sets the query type to <i>type</i>, which can be any
  valid query type supported in BIND 9 except for zone transfer types AXFR and
  IXFR. As with <b>-q</b>, this is useful to distinguish query name type or
  class when they are ambiguous. it is sometimes necessary to disambiguate names
  from types.
<p class="Pp">The default query type is &quot;A&quot;, unless the <b>-x</b>
    option is supplied to indicate a reverse lookup, in which case it is
    &quot;PTR&quot;.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-v</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print the <b>delv</b> version and exit.</div>
<p class="Pp">-x <i>addr</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Performs a reverse lookup, mapping an addresses to a
  name. <i>addr</i> is an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation, or a
  colon-delimited IPv6 address. When <b>-x</b> is used, there is no need to
  provide the <i>name</i> or <i>type</i> arguments. <b>delv</b> automatically
  performs a lookup for a name like 11.12.13.10.in-addr.arpa and sets the query
  type to PTR. IPv6 addresses are looked up using nibble format under the
  IP6.ARPA domain.</div>
<p class="Pp">-4</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Forces <b>delv</b> to only use IPv4.</div>
<p class="Pp">-6</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Forces <b>delv</b> to only use IPv6.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="QUERY_OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#QUERY_OPTIONS">QUERY
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>delv</b> provides a number of query options which affect the
    way results are displayed, and in some cases the way lookups are
  performed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each query option is identified by a keyword preceded by a plus
    sign (+). Some keywords set or reset an option. These may be preceded by the
    string no to negate the meaning of that keyword. Other keywords assign
    values to options like the timeout interval. They have the form
    <b>+keyword=value</b>. The query options are:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]cdflag</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Controls whether to set the CD (checking disabled) bit in
  queries sent by <b>delv</b>. This may be useful when troubleshooting DNSSEC
  problems from behind a validating resolver. A validating resolver will block
  invalid responses, making it difficult to retrieve them for analysis. Setting
  the CD flag on queries will cause the resolver to return invalid responses,
  which <b>delv</b> can then validate internally and report the errors in
  detail.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]class</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Controls whether to display the CLASS when printing a
  record. The default is to display the CLASS.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]ttl</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Controls whether to display the TTL when printing a
  record. The default is to display the TTL.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]rtrace</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Toggle resolver fetch logging. This reports the name and
  type of each query sent by <b>delv</b> in the process of carrying out the
  resolution and validation process: this includes including the original query
  and all subsequent queries to follow CNAMEs and to establish a chain of trust
  for DNSSEC validation.
<p class="Pp">This is equivalent to setting the debug level to 1 in the
    &quot;resolver&quot; logging category. Setting the systemwide debug level to
    1 using the <b>-d</b> option will product the same output (but will affect
    other logging categories as well).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]mtrace</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Toggle message logging. This produces a detailed dump of
  the responses received by <b>delv</b> in the process of carrying out the
  resolution and validation process.
<p class="Pp">This is equivalent to setting the debug level to 10 for the the
    &quot;packets&quot; module of the &quot;resolver&quot; logging category.
    Setting the systemwide debug level to 10 using the <b>-d</b> option will
    produce the same output (but will affect other logging categories as
  well).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]vtrace</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Toggle validation logging. This shows the internal
  process of the validator as it determines whether an answer is validly signed,
  unsigned, or invalid.
<p class="Pp">This is equivalent to setting the debug level to 3 for the the
    &quot;validator&quot; module of the &quot;dnssec&quot; logging category.
    Setting the systemwide debug level to 3 using the <b>-d</b> option will
    produce the same output (but will affect other logging categories as
  well).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]short</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Provide a terse answer. The default is to print the
  answer in a verbose form.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]comments</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Toggle the display of comment lines in the output. The
  default is to print comments.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]rrcomments</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Toggle the display of per-record comments in the output
  (for example, human-readable key information about DNSKEY records). The
  default is to print per-record comments.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]crypto</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Toggle the display of cryptographic fields in DNSSEC
  records. The contents of these field are unnecessary to debug most DNSSEC
  validation failures and removing them makes it easier to see the common
  failures. The default is to display the fields. When omitted they are replaced
  by the string &quot;[omitted]&quot; or in the DNSKEY case the key id is
  displayed as the replacement, e.g. &quot;[ key id = value ]&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]trust</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Controls whether to display the trust level when printing
  a record. The default is to display the trust level.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]split[=W]</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Split long hex- or base64-formatted fields in resource
  records into chunks of <i>W</i> characters (where <i>W</i> is rounded up to
  the nearest multiple of 4). <i>+nosplit</i> or <i>+split=0</i> causes fields
  not to be split at all. The default is 56 characters, or 44 characters when
  multiline mode is active.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]all</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set or clear the display options <b>+[no]comments</b>,
  <b>+[no]rrcomments</b>, and <b>+[no]trust</b> as a group.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]multiline</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print long records (such as RRSIG, DNSKEY, and SOA
  records) in a verbose multi-line format with human-readable comments. The
  default is to print each record on a single line, to facilitate machine
  parsing of the <b>delv</b> output.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]dnssec</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Indicates whether to display RRSIG records in the
  <b>delv</b> output. The default is to do so. Note that (unlike in <b>dig</b>)
  this does <i>not</i> control whether to request DNSSEC records or whether to
  validate them. DNSSEC records are always requested, and validation will always
  occur unless suppressed by the use of <b>-i</b> or <b>+noroot</b> and
  <b>+nodlv</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]root[=ROOT]</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Indicates whether to perform conventional (non-lookaside)
  DNSSEC validation, and if so, specifies the name of a trust anchor. The
  default is to validate using a trust anchor of &quot;.&quot; (the root zone),
  for which there is a built-in key. If specifying a different trust anchor,
  then <b>-a</b> must be used to specify a file containing the key.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>+[no]dlv[=DLV]</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Indicates whether to perform DNSSEC lookaside validation,
  and if so, specifies the name of the DLV trust anchor. The default is to
  perform lookaside validation using a trust anchor of &quot;dlv.isc.org&quot;,
  for which there is a built-in key. If specifying a different name, then
  <b>-a</b> must be used to specify a file containing the DLV key.</div>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="macOS_NOTICE"><a class="permalink" href="#macOS_NOTICE">macOS
