<p class="Pp">See also <b>git-add</b>(1) for a more user-friendly way to do some
    of the most common operations on the index.</p>
<p class="Pp">The way <i>git update-index</i> handles files it is told about can
    be modified using the various options:</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">--add</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If a specified file isn&#x2019;t in the index already
  then it&#x2019;s added. Default behaviour is to ignore new files.</div>
<p class="Pp">--remove</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If a specified file is in the index but is missing then
  it&#x2019;s removed. Default behavior is to ignore removed file.</div>
<p class="Pp">--refresh</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Looks at the current index and checks to see if merges or
  updates are needed by checking stat() information.</div>
<p class="Pp">-q</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Quiet. If --refresh finds that the index needs an update,
  the default behavior is to error out. This option makes <i>git
  update-index</i> continue anyway.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-submodules</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not try to update submodules. This option is only
  respected when passed before --refresh.</div>
<p class="Pp">--unmerged</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If --refresh finds unmerged changes in the index, the
  default behavior is to error out. This option makes <i>git update-index</i>
  continue anyway.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-missing</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignores missing files during a --refresh</div>
<p class="Pp">--cacheinfo &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;object&gt;,&lt;path&gt;, --cacheinfo
    &lt;mode&gt; &lt;object&gt; &lt;path&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Directly insert the specified info into the index. For
  backward compatibility, you can also give these three arguments as three
  separate parameters, but new users are encouraged to use a single-parameter
  form.</div>
<p class="Pp">--index-info</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Read index information from stdin.</div>
<p class="Pp">--chmod=(+|-)x</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the execute permissions on the updated files.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]assume-unchanged</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When this flag is specified, the object names recorded
  for the paths are not updated. Instead, this option sets/unsets the
  &quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit for the paths. When the &quot;assume
  unchanged&quot; bit is on, the user promises not to change the file and allows
  Git to assume that the working tree file matches what is recorded in the
  index. If you want to change the working tree file, you need to unset the bit
  to tell Git. This is sometimes helpful when working with a big project on a
  filesystem that has very slow lstat(2) system call (e.g. cifs).
<p class="Pp">Git will fail (gracefully) in case it needs to modify this file in
    the index e.g. when merging in a commit; thus, in case the assumed-untracked
    file is changed upstream, you will need to handle the situation
  manually.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--really-refresh</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Like <b>--refresh</b>, but checks stat information
  unconditionally, without regard to the &quot;assume unchanged&quot;
  setting.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]skip-worktree</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When one of these flags is specified, the object name
  recorded for the paths are not updated. Instead, these options set and unset
  the &quot;skip-worktree&quot; bit for the paths. See section
  &quot;Skip-worktree bit&quot; below for more information.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]ignore-skip-worktree-entries</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not remove skip-worktree (AKA &quot;index-only&quot;)
  entries even when the <b>--remove</b> option was specified.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]fsmonitor-valid</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When one of these flags is specified, the object name
  recorded for the paths are not updated. Instead, these options set and unset
  the &quot;fsmonitor valid&quot; bit for the paths. See section &quot;File
  System Monitor&quot; below for more information.</div>
<p class="Pp">-g, --again</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Runs <i>git update-index</i> itself on the paths whose
  index entries are different from those from the <b>HEAD</b> commit.</div>
<p class="Pp">--unresolve</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Restores the <i>unmerged</i> or <i>needs updating</i>
  state of a file during a merge if it was cleared by accident.</div>
<p class="Pp">--info-only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not create objects in the object database for all
  &lt;file&gt; arguments that follow this flag; just insert their object IDs
  into the index.</div>
<p class="Pp">--force-remove</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Remove the file from the index even when the working
  directory still has such a file. (Implies --remove.)</div>
<p class="Pp">--replace</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, when a file <b>path</b> exists in the index,
  <i>git update-index</i> refuses an attempt to add <b>path/file</b>. Similarly
  if a file <b>path/file</b> exists, a file <b>path</b> cannot be added. With
  --replace flag, existing entries that conflict with the entry being added are
  automatically removed with warning messages.</div>
<p class="Pp">--stdin</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of taking list of paths from the command line,
  read list of paths from the standard input. Paths are separated by LF (i.e.
  one path per line) by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">--verbose</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Report what is being added and removed from index.</div>
<p class="Pp">--index-version &lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Write the resulting index out in the named on-disk format
  version. Supported versions are 2, 3 and 4. The current default version is 2
  or 3, depending on whether extra features are used, such as <b>git add -N</b>.
<p class="Pp">Version 4 performs a simple pathname compression that reduces
    index size by 30%-50% on large repositories, which results in faster load
    time. Version 4 is relatively young (first released in 1.8.0 in October
    2012). Other Git implementations such as JGit and libgit2 may not support it
    yet.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-z</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only meaningful with <b>--stdin</b> or
  <b>--index-info</b>; paths are separated with NUL character instead of
  LF.</div>
<p class="Pp">--split-index, --no-split-index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable or disable split index mode. If split-index mode
  is already enabled and <b>--split-index</b> is given again, all changes in
  $GIT_DIR/index are pushed back to the shared index file.
<p class="Pp">These options take effect whatever the value of the
    <b>core.splitIndex</b> configuration variable (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).
    But a warning is emitted when the change goes against the configured value,
    as the configured value will take effect next time the index is read and
    this will remove the intended effect of the option.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--untracked-cache, --no-untracked-cache</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable or disable untracked cache feature. Please use
  <b>--test-untracked-cache</b> before enabling it.
<p class="Pp">These options take effect whatever the value of the
    <b>core.untrackedCache</b> configuration variable (see
    <b>git-config</b>(1)). But a warning is emitted when the change goes against
    the configured value, as the configured value will take effect next time the
    index is read and this will remove the intended effect of the option.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--test-untracked-cache</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only perform tests on the working directory to make sure
  untracked cache can be used. You have to manually enable untracked cache using
  <b>--untracked-cache</b> or <b>--force-untracked-cache</b> or the
  <b>core.untrackedCache</b> configuration variable afterwards if you really
  want to use it. If a test fails the exit code is 1 and a message explains what
  is not working as needed, otherwise the exit code is 0 and OK is
  printed.</div>
<p class="Pp">--force-untracked-cache</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Same as <b>--untracked-cache</b>. Provided for backwards
  compatibility with older versions of Git where <b>--untracked-cache</b> used
  to imply <b>--test-untracked-cache</b> but this option would enable the
  extension unconditionally.</div>
<p class="Pp">--fsmonitor, --no-fsmonitor</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable or disable files system monitor feature. These
  options take effect whatever the value of the <b>core.fsmonitor</b>
  configuration variable (see <b>git-config</b>(1)). But a warning is emitted
  when the change goes against the configured value, as the configured value
  will take effect next time the index is read and this will remove the intended
  effect of the option.</div>
<p class="Pp">--</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not interpret any more arguments as options.</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Files to act on. Note that files beginning with <i>.</i>
  are discarded. This includes <b>./file</b> and <b>dir/./file</b>. If you
  don&#x2019;t want this, then use cleaner names. The same applies to
  directories ending <i>/</i> and paths with <i>//</i></div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh">USING --REFRESH</h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>--refresh</b> does not calculate a new sha1 file or bring the
    index up to date for mode/content changes. But what it <b>does</b> do is to
    &quot;re-match&quot; the stat information of a file with the index, so that
    you can refresh the index for a file that hasn&#x2019;t been changed but
    where the stat entry is out of date.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, you&#x2019;d want to do this after doing a <i>git
    read-tree</i>, to link up the stat index details with the proper files.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh">USING --CACHEINFO OR --INFO-ONLY</h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>--cacheinfo</b> is used to register a file that is not in the
    current working directory. This is useful for minimum-checkout merging.</p>
<p class="Pp">To pretend you have a file at path with mode and sha1, say:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git update-index --add --cacheinfo &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;sha1&gt;,&lt;path&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp"><b>--info-only</b> is used to register files without placing them
    in the object database. This is useful for status-only repositories.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both <b>--cacheinfo</b> and <b>--info-only</b> behave similarly:
    the index is updated but the object database isn&#x2019;t.
    <b>--cacheinfo</b> is useful when the object is in the database but the file
    isn&#x2019;t available locally. <b>--info-only</b> is useful when the file
    is available, but you do not wish to update the object database.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh">USING --INDEX-INFO</h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>--index-info</b> is a more powerful mechanism that lets you
    feed multiple entry definitions from the standard input, and designed
    specifically for scripts. It can take inputs of three formats:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.mode SP type SP sha1 TAB path
<p class="Pp">This format is to stuff <b>git ls-tree</b> output into the
  index.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.mode SP sha1 SP stage TAB path
<p class="Pp">This format is to put higher order stages into the index file and
    matches <i>git ls-files --stage</i> output.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.mode SP sha1 TAB path
<p class="Pp">This format is no longer produced by any Git command, but is and
    will continue to be supported by <b>update-index --index-info</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">To place a higher stage entry to the index, the path should first
    be removed by feeding a mode=0 entry for the path, and then feeding
    necessary input lines in the third format.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, starting with this index:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git ls-files -s
100644 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 0       frotz
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">you can feed the following input to <b>--index-info</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git update-index --index-info
0 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000      frotz
100644 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 1       frotz
100755 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 2       frotz
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The first line of the input feeds 0 as the mode to remove the
    path; the SHA-1 does not matter as long as it is well formatted. Then the
    second and third line feeds stage 1 and stage 2 entries for that path. After
    the above, we would end up with this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git ls-files -s
100644 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 1       frotz
100755 8a1218a1024a212bb3db30becd860315f9f3ac52 2       frotz
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh">USING &#x201C;ASSUME UNCHANGED&#x201D; BIT</h1>
<p class="Pp">Many operations in Git depend on your filesystem to have an
    efficient <b>lstat(2)</b> implementation, so that <b>st_mtime</b>
    information for working tree files can be cheaply checked to see if the file
    contents have changed from the version recorded in the index file.
    Unfortunately, some filesystems have inefficient <b>lstat(2)</b>. If your
    filesystem is one of them, you can set &quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit to
    paths you have not changed to cause Git not to do this check. Note that
    setting this bit on a path does not mean Git will check the contents of the
    file to see if it has changed &#x2014; it makes Git to omit any checking and
    assume it has <b>not</b> changed. When you make changes to working tree
    files, you have to explicitly tell Git about it by dropping &quot;assume
    unchanged&quot; bit, either before or after you modify them.</p>
<p class="Pp">In order to set &quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit, use
    <b>--assume-unchanged</b> option. To unset, use
    <b>--no-assume-unchanged</b>. To see which files have the &quot;assume
    unchanged&quot; bit set, use <b>git ls-files -v</b> (see
    <b>git-ls-files</b>(1)).</p>
<p class="Pp">The command looks at <b>core.ignorestat</b> configuration
    variable. When this is true, paths updated with <b>git update-index
    paths...</b> and paths updated with other Git commands that update both
    index and working tree (e.g. <i>git apply --index</i>, <i>git checkout-index
    -u</i>, and <i>git read-tree -u</i>) are automatically marked as
    &quot;assume unchanged&quot;. Note that &quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit is
    <b>not</b> set if <b>git update-index --refresh</b> finds the working tree
    file matches the index (use <b>git update-index --really-refresh</b> if you
    want to mark them as &quot;assume unchanged&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes users confuse the assume-unchanged bit with the
    skip-worktree bit. See the final paragraph in the &quot;Skip-worktree
    bit&quot; section below for an explanation of the differences.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SKIP"><a class="permalink" href="#SKIP">SKIP-WORKTREE
  BIT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Skip-worktree bit can be defined in one (long) sentence: Tell git
    to avoid writing the file to the working directory when reasonably possible,
    and treat the file as unchanged when it is not present in the working
    directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that not all git commands will pay attention to this bit, and
    some only partially support it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The update-index flags and the read-tree capabilities relating to
    the skip-worktree bit predated the introduction of the
    <b>git-sparse-checkout</b>(1) command, which provides a much easier way to
    configure and handle the skip-worktree bits. If you want to reduce your
    working tree to only deal with a subset of the files in the repository, we
    strongly encourage the use of <b>git-sparse-checkout</b>(1) in preference to
    the low-level update-index and read-tree primitives.</p>
<p class="Pp">The primary purpose of the skip-worktree bit is to enable sparse
    checkouts, i.e. to have working directories with only a subset of paths
    present. When the skip-worktree bit is set, Git commands (such as
    <b>switch</b>, <b>pull</b>, <b>merge</b>) will avoid writing these files.
    However, these commands will sometimes write these files anyway in important
    cases such as conflicts during a merge or rebase. Git commands will also
    avoid treating the lack of such files as an intentional deletion; for
    example <b>git add -u</b> will not not stage a deletion for these files and
    <b>git commit -a</b> will not make a commit deleting them either.</p>
<p class="Pp">Although this bit looks similar to assume-unchanged bit, its goal
    is different. The assume-unchanged bit is for leaving the file in the
    working tree but having Git omit checking it for changes and presuming that
    the file has not been changed (though if it can determine without
    stat&#x2019;ing the file that it has changed, it is free to record the
    changes). skip-worktree tells Git to ignore the absence of the file, avoid
    updating it when possible with commands that normally update much of the
    working directory (e.g. <b>checkout</b>, <b>switch</b>, <b>pull</b>, etc.),
    and not have its absence be recorded in commits. Note that in sparse
    checkouts (setup by <b>git sparse-checkout</b> or by configuring
    core.sparseCheckout to true), if a file is marked as skip-worktree in the
    index but is found in the working tree, Git will clear the skip-worktree bit
    for that file.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SPLIT_INDEX"><a class="permalink" href="#SPLIT_INDEX">SPLIT
  INDEX</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This mode is designed for repositories with very large indexes,
    and aims at reducing the time it takes to repeatedly write these
  indexes.</p>
<p class="Pp">In this mode, the index is split into two files, $GIT_DIR/index
    and $GIT_DIR/sharedindex.&lt;SHA-1&gt;. Changes are accumulated in
    $GIT_DIR/index, the split index, while the shared index file contains all
    index entries and stays unchanged.</p>
<p class="Pp">All changes in the split index are pushed back to the shared index
    file when the number of entries in the split index reaches a level specified
    by the splitIndex.maxPercentChange config variable (see
    <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>
<p class="Pp">Each time a new shared index file is created, the old shared index
    files are deleted if their modification time is older than what is specified
    by the splitIndex.sharedIndexExpire config variable (see
    <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>
<p class="Pp">To avoid deleting a shared index file that is still used, its
    modification time is updated to the current time every time a new split
    index based on the shared index file is either created or read from.</p>

<p class="Pp">This cache is meant to speed up commands that involve determining

<p class="Pp">This feature works by recording the mtime of the working tree
    directories and then omitting reading directories and stat calls against
    files in those directories whose mtime hasn&#x2019;t changed. For this to
    work the underlying operating system and file system must change the
    <b>st_mtime</b> field of directories if files in the directory are added,
    modified or deleted.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can test whether the filesystem supports that with the
    <b>--test-untracked-cache</b> option. The <b>--untracked-cache</b> option
    used to implicitly perform that test in older versions of Git, but
    that&#x2019;s no longer the case.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to enable (or disable) this feature, it is easier to
    use the <b>core.untrackedCache</b> configuration variable (see
    <b>git-config</b>(1)) than using the <b>--untracked-cache</b> option to
    <b>git update-index</b> in each repository, especially if you want to do so
    across all repositories you use, because you can set the configuration
    variable to <b>true</b> (or <b>false</b>) in your <b>$HOME/.gitconfig</b>
    just once and have it affect all repositories you touch.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>core.untrackedCache</b> configuration variable is
    changed, the untracked cache is added to or removed from the index the next
    time a command reads the index; while when
    <b>--[no-|force-]untracked-cache</b> are used, the untracked cache is
    immediately added to or removed from the index.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before 2.17, the untracked cache had a bug where replacing a
    directory with a symlink to another directory could cause it to incorrectly
    show files tracked by git as untracked. See the &quot;status: add a failing
    test showing a core.untrackedCache bug&quot; commit to git.git. A workaround
    for that is (and this might work for other undiscovered bugs in the
  future):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git -c core.untrackedCache=false status
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This bug has also been shown to affect non-symlink cases of
    replacing a directory with a file when it comes to the internal structures
    of the untracked cache, but no case has been reported where this resulted in
    wrong &quot;git status&quot; output.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are also cases where existing indexes written by git
    versions before 2.17 will reference directories that don&#x2019;t exist
    anymore, potentially causing many &quot;could not open directory&quot;
    warnings to be printed on &quot;git status&quot;. These are new warnings for
    existing issues that were previously silently discarded.</p>
<p class="Pp">As with the bug described above the solution is to one-off do a
    &quot;git status&quot; run with <b>core.untrackedCache=false</b> to flush
    out the leftover bad data.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="FILE_SYSTEM_MONITOR"><a class="permalink" href="#FILE_SYSTEM_MONITOR">FILE
  SYSTEM MONITOR</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This feature is intended to speed up git operations for repos that
    have large working directories.</p>
<p class="Pp">It enables git to work together with a file system monitor (see
    <b>git-fsmonitor--daemon</b>(1) and the &quot;fsmonitor-watchman&quot;
    section of <b>githooks</b>(5)) that can inform it as to what files have been
    modified. This enables git to avoid having to lstat() every file to find
    modified files.</p>
<p class="Pp">When used in conjunction with the untracked cache, it can further
    improve performance by avoiding the cost of scanning the entire working
    directory looking for new files.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you want to enable (or disable) this feature, it is easier to
    use the <b>core.fsmonitor</b> configuration variable (see
    <b>git-config</b>(1)) than using the <b>--fsmonitor</b> option to <b>git
    update-index</b> in each repository, especially if you want to do so across
    all repositories you use, because you can set the configuration variable in
    your <b>$HOME/.gitconfig</b> just once and have it affect all repositories
    you touch.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>core.fsmonitor</b> configuration variable is changed,
    the file system monitor is added to or removed from the index the next time
    a command reads the index. When <b>--[no-]fsmonitor</b> are used, the file
    system monitor is immediately added to or removed from the index.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The command honors <b>core.filemode</b> configuration variable. If
    your repository is on a filesystem whose executable bits are unreliable,
    this should be set to <i>false</i> (see <b>git-config</b>(1)). This causes
    the command to ignore differences in file modes recorded in the index and
    the file mode on the filesystem if they differ only on executable bit. On
    such an unfortunate filesystem, you may need to use <i>git update-index
    --chmod=</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Quite similarly, if <b>core.symlinks</b> configuration variable is
    set to <i>false</i> (see <b>git-config</b>(1)), symbolic links are checked
    out as plain files, and this command does not modify a recorded file mode
    from symbolic link to regular file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command looks at <b>core.ignorestat</b> configuration
    variable. See <i>Using &quot;assume unchanged&quot; bit</i> section
  above.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command also looks at <b>core.trustctime</b> configuration
    variable. It can be useful when the inode change time is regularly modified
    by something outside Git (file system crawlers and backup systems use ctime
    for marking files processed) (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>
<p class="Pp">The untracked cache extension can be enabled by the
    <b>core.untrackedCache</b> configuration variable (see
    <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Users often try to use the assume-unchanged and skip-worktree bits
    to tell Git to ignore changes to files that are tracked. This does not work
    as expected, since Git may still check working tree files against the index
    when performing certain operations. In general, Git does not provide a way
    to ignore changes to tracked files, so alternate solutions are
  recommended.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, if the file you want to change is some sort of config
    file, the repository can include a sample config file that can then be
    copied into the ignored name and modified. The repository can even include a
    script to treat the sample file as a template, modifying and copying it
    automatically.</p>
