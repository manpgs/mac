<p class="Pp">This section of the FAQ answers very general, high-level questions
    about Perl.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is_Perl?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is_Perl?">What
  is Perl?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl is a high-level programming language with an eclectic
    heritage written by Larry Wall and a cast of thousands.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl's process, file, and text manipulation facilities make it
    particularly well-suited for tasks involving quick prototyping, system
    utilities, software tools, system management tasks, database access,
    graphical programming, networking, and web programming.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl derives from the ubiquitous C programming language and to a
    lesser extent from sed, awk, the Unix shell, and many other tools and
    languages.</p>
<p class="Pp">These strengths make it especially popular with web developers and
    system administrators. Mathematicians, geneticists, journalists, managers
    and many other people also use Perl.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Who_supports_Perl?_Who_develops_it?_Why_is_it_free?"><a class="permalink" href="#Who_supports_Perl?_Who_develops_it?_Why_is_it_free?">Who
  supports Perl? Who develops it? Why is it free?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The original culture of the pre-populist Internet and the
    deeply-held beliefs of Perl's author, Larry Wall, gave rise to the free and
    open distribution policy of Perl. Perl is supported by its users. The core,
    the standard Perl library, the optional modules, and the documentation
    you're reading now were all written by volunteers.</p>
<p class="Pp">The core development team (known as the Perl Porters) are a group
    of highly altruistic individuals committed to producing better software for
    free than you could hope to purchase for money. You may snoop on pending
    developments via the archives
    &lt;http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/&gt; or you can
    subscribe to the mailing list by sending perl5-porters-subscribe@perl.org a
    subscription request (an empty message with no subject is fine).</p>
<p class="Pp">While the GNU project includes Perl in its distributions, there's
    no such thing as &quot;GNU Perl&quot;. Perl is not produced nor maintained
    by the Free Software Foundation. Perl's licensing terms are also more open
    than GNU software's tend to be.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can get commercial support of Perl if you wish, although for
    most users the informal support will more than suffice. See the answer to
    &quot;Where can I buy a commercial version of Perl?&quot; for more
    information.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Which_version_of_Perl_should_I_use?"><a class="permalink" href="#Which_version_of_Perl_should_I_use?">Which
  version of Perl should I use?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">(contributed by brian d foy with updates from others)</p>
<p class="Pp">There is often a matter of opinion and taste, and there isn't any
    one answer that fits everyone. In general, you want to use either the
    current stable release, or the stable release immediately prior to that
  one.</p>
<p class="Pp">Beyond that, you have to consider several things and decide which
    is best for you.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>If things aren't broken, upgrading perl may break them (or at least issue
      new warnings).</li>
  <li>The latest versions of perl have more bug fixes.</li>
  <li>The latest versions of perl may contain performance improvements and
      features not present in older versions. There have been many changes in
      perl since perl5 was first introduced.</li>
  <li>The Perl community is geared toward supporting the most recent releases,
      so you'll have an easier time finding help for those.</li>
  <li>Older versions of perl may have security vulnerabilities, some of which
      are serious (see perlsec and search CVEs
      &lt;https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=Perl&gt; for more
      information).</li>
  <li>The latest versions are probably the least deployed and widely tested, so
      you may want to wait a few months after their release and see what
      problems others have if you are risk averse.</li>
  <li>The immediate, in addition to the current stable release, the previous
      stable release is maintained. See &quot;MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT&quot; in
      perlpolicy for more information.</li>
  <li>There are really two tracks of perl development: a maintenance version and
      an experimental version. The maintenance versions are stable, and have an
      even number as the minor release (i.e. perl5.24.x, where 24 is the minor
      release). The experimental versions may include features that don't make
      it into the stable versions, and have an odd number as the minor release
      (i.e. perl5.25.x, where 25 is the minor release).</li>
  <li>You can consult releases &lt;http://dev.perl.org/perl5&gt; to determine
      the current stable release of Perl.</li>

<h2 class="Ss" id="What_are_Perl_4,_Perl_5,_or_Raku_(Perl_6)?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_are_Perl_4,_Perl_5,_or_Raku_(Perl_6)?">What
  are Perl 4, Perl 5, or Raku (Perl 6)?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In short, Perl 4 is the parent to both Perl 5 and Raku (formerly
    known as Perl 6). Perl 5 is the older sibling, and though they are different
    languages, someone who knows one will spot many similarities in the
  other.</p>
<p class="Pp">The number after Perl (i.e. the 5 after Perl 5) is the major
    release of the perl interpreter as well as the version of the language. Each
    major version has significant differences that earlier versions cannot
    support.</p>
<p class="Pp">The current major release of Perl is Perl 5, first released in
    1994. It can run scripts from the previous major release, Perl 4 (March
    1991), but has significant differences.</p>
<p class="Pp">Raku is a reinvention of Perl, a language in the same lineage but
    not compatible. The two are complementary, not mutually exclusive. Raku is
    not meant to replace Perl, and vice versa. See &quot;What is Raku (Perl
    6)?&quot; below to find out more.</p>
<p class="Pp">See perlhist for a history of Perl revisions.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is_Raku_(Perl_6)?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is_Raku_(Perl_6)?">What
  is Raku (Perl 6)?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Raku (formerly known as Perl 6) was <i>originally</i> described as
    the community's rewrite of Perl, however as the language evolved, it became
    clear that it is a separate language, but in the same language family as
    Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">Raku is not intended primarily as a replacement for Perl, but as
    its own thing - and libraries exist to allow you to call Perl code from Raku
    programs and vice versa.</p>
<p class="Pp">Contrary to popular belief, Raku and Perl peacefully coexist with
    one another. Raku has proven to be a fascinating source of ideas for those
    using Perl (the Moose object system is a well-known example). There is
    overlap in the communities, and this overlap fosters the tradition of
    sharing and borrowing that have been instrumental to Perl's success.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more about Raku see &lt;https://www.raku.org/&gt;.</p>

    reinventing.&quot; --Larry Wall</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_stable_is_Perl?"><a class="permalink" href="#How_stable_is_Perl?">How
  stable is Perl?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Production releases, which incorporate bug fixes and new
    functionality, are widely tested before release. Since the 5.000 release, we
    have averaged about one production release per year.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Perl development team occasionally make changes to the
    internal core of the language, but all possible efforts are made toward
    backward compatibility.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="How_often_are_new_versions_of_Perl_released?"><a class="permalink" href="#How_often_are_new_versions_of_Perl_released?">How
  often are new versions of Perl released?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Recently, the plan has been to release a new version of Perl
    roughly every April, but getting the release right is more important than
    sticking rigidly to a calendar date, so the release date is somewhat
    flexible. The historical release dates can be viewed at
    &lt;http://www.cpan.org/src/README.html&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Even numbered minor versions (5.14, 5.16, 5.18) are production
    versions, and odd numbered minor versions (5.15, 5.17, 5.19) are development
    versions. Unless you want to try out an experimental feature, you probably
    never want to install a development version of Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Perl development team are called Perl 5 Porters, and their
    organization is described at
    &lt;http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpolicy.html&gt;. The organizational rules
    really just boil down to one: Larry is always right, even when he was
  wrong.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Is_Perl_difficult_to_learn?"><a class="permalink" href="#Is_Perl_difficult_to_learn?">Is
  Perl difficult to learn?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">No, Perl is easy to start learning &lt;http://learn.perl.org/&gt;
    --and easy to keep learning. It looks like most programming languages you're
    likely to have experience with, so if you've ever written a C program, an
    awk script, a shell script, or even a BASIC program, you're already partway
    there.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most tasks only require a small subset of the Perl language. One
    of the guiding mottos for Perl development is &quot;there's more than one
    way to do it&quot; (TMTOWTDI, sometimes pronounced &quot;tim toady&quot;).
    Perl's learning curve is therefore shallow (easy to learn) and long (there's
    a whole lot you can do if you really want).</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, because Perl is frequently (but not always, and certainly
    not by definition) an interpreted language, you can write your programs and
    test them without an intermediate compilation step, allowing you to
    experiment and test/debug quickly and easily. This ease of experimentation
    flattens the learning curve even more.</p>
<p class="Pp">Things that make Perl easier to learn: Unix experience, almost any
    kind of programming experience, an understanding of regular expressions, and
    the ability to understand other people's code. If there's something you need
    to do, then it's probably already been done, and a working example is
    usually available for free. Don't forget Perl modules, either. They're
    discussed in Part 3 of this FAQ, along with CPAN
    &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;, which is discussed in Part 2.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_does_Perl_compare_with_other_languages_like_Java,_Python,_"><a class="permalink" href="#How_does_Perl_compare_with_other_languages_like_Java,_Python,_">How
  does Perl compare with other languages like Java, Python, REXX, Scheme, or
  Tcl?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl can be used for almost any coding problem, even ones which
    require integrating specialist C code for extra speed. As with any tool it
    can be used well or badly. Perl has many strengths, and a few weaknesses,
    precisely which areas are good and bad is often a personal choice.</p>
<p class="Pp">When choosing a language you should also be influenced by the
    resources &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt;, testing culture
    &lt;http://www.cpantesters.org/&gt; and community
    &lt;http://www.perl.org/community.html&gt; which surrounds it.</p>
<p class="Pp">For comparisons to a specific language it is often best to create
    a small project in both languages and compare the results, make sure to use
    all the resources &lt;http://www.cpan.org/&gt; of each language, as a
    language is far more than just it's syntax.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Can_I_do__task__in_Perl?"><a class="permalink" href="#Can_I_do__task__in_Perl?">Can
  I do [task] in Perl?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl is flexible and extensible enough for you to use on virtually
    any task, from one-line file-processing tasks to large, elaborate
  systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">For many people, Perl serves as a great replacement for shell
    scripting. For others, it serves as a convenient, high-level replacement for
    most of what they'd program in low-level languages like C or C++. It's
    ultimately up to you (and possibly your management) which tasks you'll use
    Perl for and which you won't.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you have a library that provides an API, you can make any
    component of it available as just another Perl function or variable using a
    Perl extension written in C or C++ and dynamically linked into your main
    perl interpreter. You can also go the other direction, and write your main
    program in C or C++, and then link in some Perl code on the fly, to create a
    powerful application. See perlembed.</p>
<p class="Pp">That said, there will always be small, focused, special-purpose
    languages dedicated to a specific problem domain that are simply more
    convenient for certain kinds of problems. Perl tries to be all things to all
    people, but nothing special to anyone. Examples of specialized languages
    that come to mind include prolog and matlab.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="When_shouldn't_I_program_in_Perl?"><a class="permalink" href="#When_shouldn't_I_program_in_Perl?">When
  shouldn't I program in Perl?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">One good reason is when you already have an existing application
    written in another language that's all done (and done well), or you have an
    application language specifically designed for a certain task (e.g. prolog,
    make).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you find that you need to speed up a specific part of a Perl
    application (not something you often need) you may want to use C, but you
    can access this from your Perl code with perlxs.</p>

  the difference between &quot;perl&quot; and &quot;Perl&quot;?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">&quot;Perl&quot; is the name of the language. Only the
    &quot;P&quot; is capitalized. The name of the interpreter (the program which
    runs the Perl script) is &quot;perl&quot; with a lowercase
  &quot;p&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may or may not choose to follow this usage. But never write
    &quot;PERL&quot;, because perl is not an acronym.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="What_is_a_"><a class="permalink" href="#What_is_a_">What is a
  JAPH?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">(contributed by brian d foy)</p>
<p class="Pp">JAPH stands for &quot;Just another Perl hacker,&quot;, which
    Randal Schwartz used to sign email and usenet messages starting in the late
    1980s. He previously used the phrase with many subjects (&quot;Just another
    x hacker,&quot;), so to distinguish his JAPH, he started to write them as
    Perl programs:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print &quot;Just another Perl hacker,&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Other people picked up on this and started to write clever or
    obfuscated programs to produce the same output, spinning things quickly out
    of control while still providing hours of amusement for their creators and
    readers.</p>
<p class="Pp">CPAN has several JAPH programs at
    &lt;http://www.cpan.org/misc/japh&gt;.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="How_can_I_convince_others_to_use_Perl?"><a class="permalink" href="#How_can_I_convince_others_to_use_Perl?">How
  can I convince others to use Perl?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">(contributed by brian d foy)</p>
<p class="Pp">Appeal to their self interest! If Perl is new (and thus scary) to
    them, find something that Perl can do to solve one of their problems. That
    might mean that Perl either saves them something (time, headaches, money) or
    gives them something (flexibility, power, testability).</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, the benefit of a language is closely related to the
    skill of the people using that language. If you or your team can be faster,
    better, and stronger through Perl, you'll deliver more value. Remember,
    people often respond better to what they get out of it. If you run into
    resistance, figure out what those people get out of the other choice and how
    Perl might satisfy that requirement.</p>
<p class="Pp">You don't have to worry about finding or paying for Perl; it's
    freely available and several popular operating systems come with Perl.
    Community support in places such as Perlmonks (
    &lt;http://www.perlmonks.com&gt; ) and the various Perl mailing lists (
    &lt;http://lists.perl.org&gt; ) means that you can usually get quick answers
    to your problems.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, keep in mind that Perl might not be the right tool for
    every job. You're a much better advocate if your claims are reasonable and
    grounded in reality. Dogmatically advocating anything tends to make people
    discount your message. Be honest about possible disadvantages to your choice
    of Perl since any choice has trade-offs.</p>
