<p class="Pp">This command shows the differences between two versions of a patch
    series, or more generally, two commit ranges (ignoring merge commits).</p>
<p class="Pp">In the presence of <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> arguments, these commit
    ranges are limited accordingly.</p>
<p class="Pp">To that end, it first finds pairs of commits from both commit
    ranges that correspond with each other. Two commits are said to correspond
    when the diff between their patches (i.e. the author information, the commit
    message and the commit diff) is reasonably small compared to the patches'
    size. See ``Algorithm`` below for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, the list of matching commits is shown in the order of the
    second commit range, with unmatched commits being inserted just after all of
    their ancestors have been shown.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are three ways to specify the commit ranges:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>&lt;range1&gt; &lt;range2&gt;</b>: Either
  commit range can be of the form <b>&lt;base&gt;..&lt;rev&gt;</b>,
  <b>&lt;rev&gt;^!</b> or <b>&lt;rev&gt;^-&lt;n&gt;</b>. See <b>SPECIFYING
  RANGES</b> in <b>gitrevisions</b>(7) for more details.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>&lt;rev1&gt;...&lt;rev2&gt;</b>. This is
  equivalent to <b>&lt;rev2&gt;..&lt;rev1&gt;
  &lt;rev1&gt;..&lt;rev2&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>&lt;base&gt; &lt;rev1&gt; &lt;rev2&gt;</b>:
  This is equivalent to <b>&lt;base&gt;..&lt;rev1&gt;
  &lt;base&gt;..&lt;rev2&gt;</b>.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">--no-dual-color</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When the commit diffs differ, &#x2018;git range-diff`
  recreates the original diffs&#x2019; coloring, and adds outer -/+ diff markers
  with the <b>background</b> being red/green to make it easier to see e.g. when
  there was a change in what exact lines were added.
<p class="Pp">Additionally, the commit diff lines that are only present in the
    first commit range are shown &quot;dimmed&quot; (this can be overridden
    using the <b>color.diff.&lt;slot&gt;</b> config setting where
    <b>&lt;slot&gt;</b> is one of <b>contextDimmed</b>, <b>oldDimmed</b> and
    <b>newDimmed</b>), and the commit diff lines that are only present in the
    second commit range are shown in bold (which can be overridden using the
    config settings <b>color.diff.&lt;slot&gt;</b> with <b>&lt;slot&gt;</b>
    being one of <b>contextBold</b>, <b>oldBold</b> or <b>newBold</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">This is known to <b>range-diff</b> as &quot;dual coloring&quot;.
    Use <b>--no-dual-color</b> to revert to color all lines according to the
    outer diff markers (and completely ignore the inner diff when it comes to
    color).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--creation-factor=&lt;percent&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the creation/deletion cost fudge factor to
  <b>&lt;percent&gt;</b>. Defaults to 60. Try a larger value if <b>git
  range-diff</b> erroneously considers a large change a total rewrite (deletion
  of one commit and addition of another), and a smaller one in the reverse case.
  See the ``Algorithm`` section below for an explanation why this is
  needed.</div>
<p class="Pp">--left-only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Suppress commits that are missing from the first
  specified range (or the &quot;left range&quot; when using the
  <b>&lt;rev1&gt;...&lt;rev2&gt;</b> format).</div>
<p class="Pp">--right-only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Suppress commits that are missing from the second
  specified range (or the &quot;right range&quot; when using the
  <b>&lt;rev1&gt;...&lt;rev2&gt;</b> format).</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]notes[=&lt;ref&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This flag is passed to the <b>git log</b> program (see
  <b>git-log</b>(1)) that generates the patches.</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;range1&gt; &lt;range2&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compare the commits specified by the two ranges, where
  <b>&lt;range1&gt;</b> is considered an older version of
  <b>&lt;range2&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;rev1&gt;...&lt;rev2&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Equivalent to passing <b>&lt;rev2&gt;..&lt;rev1&gt;</b>
  and <b>&lt;rev1&gt;..&lt;rev2&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;base&gt; &lt;rev1&gt; &lt;rev2&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Equivalent to passing <b>&lt;base&gt;..&lt;rev1&gt;</b>
  and <b>&lt;base&gt;..&lt;rev2&gt;</b>. Note that <b>&lt;base&gt;</b> does not
  need to be the exact branch point of the branches. Example: after rebasing a
  branch <b>my-topic</b>, <b>git range-diff my-topic@{u} my-topic@{1}
  my-topic</b> would show the differences introduced by the rebase.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git range-diff</b> also accepts the regular diff options (see
    <b>git-diff</b>(1)), most notably the <b>--color=[&lt;when&gt;]</b> and
    <b>--no-color</b> options. These options are used when generating the
    &quot;diff between patches&quot;, i.e. to compare the author, commit message
    and diff of corresponding old/new commits. There is currently no means to
    tweak most of the diff options passed to <b>git log</b> when generating
    those patches.</p>

  STABILITY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The output of the <b>range-diff</b> command is subject to change.
    It is intended to be human-readable porcelain output, not something that can
    be used across versions of Git to get a textually stable <b>range-diff</b>
    (as opposed to something like the <b>--stable</b> option to
    <b>git-patch-id</b>(1)). There&#x2019;s also no equivalent of
    <b>git-apply</b>(1) for <b>range-diff</b>, the output is not intended to be
    machine-readable.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is particularly true when passing in diff options. Currently
    some options like <b>--stat</b> can, as an emergent effect, produce output
    that&#x2019;s quite useless in the context of <b>range-diff</b>. Future
    versions of <b>range-diff</b> may learn to interpret such options in a
    manner specific to <b>range-diff</b> (e.g. for <b>--stat</b> producing
    human-readable output which summarizes how the diffstat changed).</p>

<p class="Pp">This command uses the <b>diff.color.*</b> and

<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">In this example, there are 3 old and 3 new commits, where the
    developer removed the 3rd, added a new one before the first two, and
    modified the commit message of the 2nd commit as well its diff.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the output goes to a terminal, it is color-coded by default,
    just like regular <b>git diff</b>'s output. In addition, the first line
    (adding a commit) is green, the last line (deleting a commit) is red, the
    second line (with a perfect match) is yellow like the commit header of
    <b>git show</b>'s output, and the third line colors the old commit red, the
    new one green and the rest like <b>git show</b>'s commit header.</p>
<p class="Pp">A naive color-coded diff of diffs is actually a bit hard to read,
    though, as it colors the entire lines red or green. The line that added
    &quot;What is unexpected&quot; in the old commit, for example, is completely
    red, even if the intent of the old commit was to add something.</p>
<p class="Pp">To help with that, <b>range</b> uses the <b>--dual-color</b> mode
    by default. In this mode, the diff of diffs will retain the original diff
    colors, and prefix the lines with -/+ markers that have their
    <b>background</b> red or green, to make it more obvious that they describe
    how the diff itself changed.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ALGORITHM"><a class="permalink" href="#ALGORITHM">ALGORITHM</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The general idea is this: we generate a cost matrix between the
    commits in both commit ranges, then solve the least-cost assignment.</p>
<p class="Pp">The cost matrix is populated thusly: for each pair of commits,
    both diffs are generated and the &quot;diff of diffs&quot; is generated,
    with 3 context lines, then the number of lines in that diff is used as
  cost.</p>
<p class="Pp">To avoid false positives (e.g. when a patch has been removed, and
    an unrelated patch has been added between two iterations of the same patch
    series), the cost matrix is extended to allow for that, by adding fixed-cost
    entries for wholesale deletes/adds.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example: Let commits <b>1--2</b> be the first iteration of a patch
    series and <b>A--C</b> the second iteration. Let&#x2019;s assume that
    <b>A</b> is a cherry-pick of <b>2,</b> and <b>C</b> is a cherry-pick of
    <b>1</b> but with a small modification (say, a fixed typo). Visualize the
    commits as a bipartite graph:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
    1            A
    2            B
                 C</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">We are looking for a &quot;best&quot; explanation of the new
    series in terms of the old one. We can represent an &quot;explanation&quot;
    as an edge in the graph:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
    1            A
               /
    2 --------'  B
                 C</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This explanation comes for &quot;free&quot; because there was no
    change. Similarly <b>C</b> could be explained using <b>1</b>, but that comes
    at some cost c&gt;0 because of the modification:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
    1 ----.      A
          |    /
    2 ----+---'  B
          |
          `----- C
          c&gt;0</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">In mathematical terms, what we are looking for is some sort of a
    minimum cost bipartite matching; &#x2018;1` is matched to <b>C</b> at some
    cost, etc. The underlying graph is in fact a complete bipartite graph; the
    cost we associate with every edge is the size of the diff between the two
    commits&#x2019; patches. To explain also new commits, we introduce dummy
    nodes on both sides:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
    1 ----.      A
          |    /
    2 ----+---'  B
          |
    o     `----- C
          c&gt;0
    o            o
    o            o</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The cost of an edge <b>o--C</b> is the size of <b>C</b>'s diff,
    modified by a fudge factor that should be smaller than 100%. The cost of an
    edge <b>o--o</b> is free. The fudge factor is necessary because even if
    <b>1</b> and <b>C</b> have nothing in common, they may still share a few
    empty lines and such, possibly making the assignment <b>1--C</b>,
    <b>o--o</b> slightly cheaper than <b>1--o</b>, <b>o--C</b> even if <b>1</b>
    and <b>C</b> have nothing in common. With the fudge factor we require a much
    larger common part to consider patches as corresponding.</p>
<p class="Pp">The overall time needed to compute this algorithm is the time
    needed to compute n+m commit diffs and then n*m diffs of patches, plus the
    time needed to compute the least-cost assignment between n and m diffs. Git
    uses an implementation of the Jonker-Volgenant algorithm to solve the
    assignment problem, which has cubic runtime complexity. The matching found
    in this case will look like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
    1 ----.      A
          |    /
    2 ----+---'  B
       .--+-----'
    o -'  `----- C
          c&gt;0
    o ---------- o
    o ---------- o</pre>
