</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This describes the set of shell functions supplied with the source
    distribution as an interface to the <b>zftp</b> builtin command, allowing
    you to perform FTP operations from the shell command line or within
    functions or scripts. The interface is similar to a traditional FTP client
    (e.g. the <b>ftp</b> command itself, see <i>ftp</i>(1)), but as it is
    entirely done within the shell all the familiar completion, editing and
    globbing features, and so on, are present, and macros are particularly
    simple to write as they are just ordinary shell functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">The prerequisite is that the <b>zftp</b> command, as described in
    <i>zshmodules</i>(1) , must be available in the version of <b>zsh</b>
    installed at your site. If the shell is configured to load new commands at
    run time, it probably is: typing `<b>zmodload zsh/zftp</b>' will make sure
    (if that runs silently, it has worked). If this is not the case, it is
    possible <b>zftp</b> was linked into the shell anyway: to test this, type
    `<b>which zftp</b>' and if <b>zftp</b> is available you will get the message
    `<b>zftp: shell built-in command</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">Commands given directly with <b>zftp</b> builtin may be
    interspersed between the functions in this suite; in a few cases, using
    <b>zftp</b> directly may cause some of the status information stored in
    shell parameters to become invalid. Note in particular the description of
    the variables <b>$ZFTP_TMOUT</b>, <b>$ZFTP_PREFS</b> and
    <b>$ZFTP_VERBOSE</b> for <b>zftp</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INSTALLATION"><a class="permalink" href="#INSTALLATION">INSTALLATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">You should make sure all the functions from the
    <b>Functions/Zftp</b> directory of the source distribution are available;
    they all begin with the two letters `<b>zf</b>'. They may already have been
    installed on your system; otherwise, you will need to find them and copy
    them. The directory should appear as one of the elements of the
    <b>$fpath</b> array (this should already be the case if they were
    installed), and at least the function <b>zfinit</b> should be autoloaded; it
    will autoload the rest. Finally, to initialize the use of the system you
    need to call the <b>zfinit</b> function. The following code in your
    <b>.zshrc</b> will arrange for this; assume the functions are stored in the
    directory <b>~/myfns</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre><b>fpath=(~/myfns $fpath)</b>
<b>autoload -U zfinit</b>
<b>zfinit</b></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that <b>zfinit</b> assumes you are using the <b>zmodload</b>
    method to load the <b>zftp</b> command. If it is already built into the
    shell, change <b>zfinit</b> to <b>zfinit -n</b>. It is helpful (though not
    essential) if the call to <b>zfinit</b> appears after any code to initialize
    the new completion system, else unnecessary <b>compctl</b> commands will be
    given.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FUNCTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The sequence of operations in performing a file transfer is
    essentially the same as that in a standard FTP client. Note that, due to a
    quirk of the shell's <b>getopts</b> builtin, for those functions that handle
    options you must use `<b>-</b><b>-</b>' rather than `<b>-</b>' to ensure the
    remaining arguments are treated literally (a single `<b>-</b>' is treated as
    an argument).</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If the command was successful, and the terminal is compatible with
    <b>xterm</b> or is <b>sun-cmd</b>, a summary will appear in the title bar,
    giving the local <b>host:directory</b> and the remote <b>host:directory</b>;
    this is handled by the function <b>zftp_chpwd</b>, described below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Normally, the <i>host</i>, <i>user</i> and <i>password</i> are
    internally recorded for later re-opening, either by a <b>zfopen</b> with no
    arguments, or automatically (see below). With the option `<b>-1</b>', no
    information is stored. Also, if an open command with arguments failed, the
    parameters will not be retained (and any previous parameters will also be
    deleted). A <b>zfopen</b> on its own, or a <b>zfopen -1</b>, never alters
    the stored parameters.</p>
<p class="Pp">Both <b>zfopen</b> and <b>zfanon</b> (but not <b>zfparams</b>)
    understand URLs of the form <b>ftp://</b><i>host</i>/<i>path...</i> as
    meaning to connect to the <i>host</i>, then change directory to <i>path</i>
    (which must be a directory, not a file). The `<b>ftp://</b>' can be omitted;
    the trailing `<b>/</b>' is enough to trigger recognition of the <i>path</i>.
    Note prefixes other than `<b>ftp:</b>' are not recognized, and that all

</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">In the first form with <i>dir</i> present, change to the directory
    <i>dir</i>. The command `<b>zfcd ..</b>' is treated specially, so is
    guaranteed to work on non-UNIX servers (note this is handled internally by
    <b>zftp</b>). If <i>dir</i> is omitted, has the effect of `<b>zfcd
  ~</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second form changes to the directory previously current.</p>
<p class="Pp">The third form attempts to change the current directory by
    replacing the first occurrence of the string <i>old</i> with the string
    <i>new</i> in the current directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that in this command, and indeed anywhere a remote filename
    is expected, the string which on the local host corresponds to `<b>~</b>' is
    converted back to a `<b>~</b>' before being passed to the remote machine.
    This is convenient because of the way expansion is performed on the command
    line before <b>zfcd</b> receives a string. For example, suppose the command
    is `<b>zfcd ~/foo</b>'. The shell will expand this to a full path such as
    `<b>zfcd /home/user2/pws/foo</b>'. At this stage, <b>zfcd</b> recognises the
    initial path as corresponding to `<b>~</b>' and will send the directory to
    the remote host as <b>~/foo</b>, so that the `<b>~</b>' will be expanded by
    the server to the correct remote host directory. Other named directories of

      <i>dir</i> are passed directly to the server and their effect is
      implementation dependent, but specifying a particular remote directory
      <i>dir</i> is usually possible. The output is passed through a pager given
      by the environment variable <b>$PAGER</b>, or `<b>more</b>' if that is not
      set.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The directory is usually cached for re-use. In fact, two caches
    are maintained. One is for use when there is no <i>dir-options</i> or
    <i>dir</i>, i.e. a full listing of the current remote directory; it is
    flushed when the current remote directory changes. The other is kept for
    repeated use of <b>zfdir</b> with the same arguments; for example, repeated
    use of `<b>zfdir /pub/gnu</b>' will only require the directory to be
    retrieved on the first call. Alternatively, this cache can be re-viewed with
    the <b>-r</b> option. As relative directories will confuse <b>zfdir</b>, the
    <b>-f</b> option can be used to force the cache to be flushed before the
    directory is listed. The option <b>-d</b> will delete both caches without
    showing a directory listing; it will also delete the cache of file names in
    the current remote directory, if any.</p>

      will usually be queried. With the option <b>-s</b>, the command runs

      The <b>-n</b> option should be used if the zftp command is already built
      into the shell.</dd>
  <dt id="zfautocheck"><a class="permalink" href="#zfautocheck"><b>zfautocheck</b>
    [ <b>-dn</b> ]</a></dt>
  <dd>This function is called to implement automatic reopening behaviour, as
      described in more detail below. The options must appear in the first
      argument; <b>-n</b> prevents the command from changing to the old
      directory, while <b>-d</b> prevents it from setting the variable
      <b>do_close</b>, which it otherwise does as a flag for automatically
      closing the connection after a transfer. The host and directory for the
      last session are stored in the variable <b>$zflastsession</b>, but the
      internal host/user/password parameters must also be correctly set.</dd>
  <dt id="zfcd_match"><a class="permalink" href="#zfcd_match"><b>zfcd_match
    </b><i>prefix</i><b> </b><i>suffix</i><b></b><i></i></a></dt>
  <dd>This performs matching for completion of remote directory names. If the
      remote server is UNIX, it will attempt to persuade the server to list the
      remote directory with subdirectories marked, which usually works but is
      not guaranteed. On other hosts it simply calls <b>zfget_match</b> and
      hence completes all files, not just directories. On some systems,
      directories may not even look like filenames.</dd>
  <dt id="zfget_match"><a class="permalink" href="#zfget_match"><b>zfget_match
    </b><i>prefix</i><b> </b><i>suffix</i><b></b><i></i></a></dt>
  <dd>This performs matching for completion of remote filenames. It caches files
      for the current directory (only) in the shell parameter
      <b>$zftp_fcache</b>. It is in the form to be called by the <b>-K</b>
      option of <b>compctl</b>, but also works when called from a widget-style
      completion function with <i>prefix</i> and <i>suffix</i> set
      appropriately.</dd>
  <dt id="zfrglob"><a class="permalink" href="#zfrglob"><b>zfrglob
    </b><i>varname</i><b></b><i></i></a></dt>
  <dd>Perform remote globbing, as describes in more detail below. <i>varname</i>
      is the name of a variable containing the pattern to be expanded; if there
      were any matches, the same variable will be set to the expanded set of
      filenames on return.</dd>
  <dt id="zfrtime"><a class="permalink" href="#zfrtime"><b>zfrtime</b>
    <i>lfile</i> <i>rfile</i> [ <i>time</i> ]</a></dt>
  <dd>Set the local file <i>lfile</i> to have the same modification time as the
      remote file <i>rfile</i>, or the explicit time <i>time</i> in FTP format
      <b>CCYYMMDDhhmmSS</b> for the GMT timezone. This uses the shell's
      <b>zsh/datetime</b> module to perform the conversion from GMT to local
      time.</dd>
  <dt id="zftp_chpwd"><a class="permalink" href="#zftp_chpwd"><b>zftp_chpwd</b></a></dt>
  <dd>This function is called every time a connection is opened, or closed, or
      the remote directory changes. This version alters the title bar of an
      <b>xterm</b>-compatible or <b>sun-cmd</b> terminal emulator to reflect the
      local and remote hostnames and current directories. It works best when
      combined with the function <b>chpwd</b>. In particular, a function of the
      form</dd>

  <dd>This function shows the status of the transfer. It will not write anything
      unless the output is going to a terminal; however, if you transfer files
      in the background, you should turn off progress reports by hand using
      `<b>zstyle ':zftp:*' progress none</b>'. Note also that if you alter it,
      any output <i>must</i> be to standard error, as standard output may be a
      file being received. The form of the progress meter, or whether it is used
      at all, can be configured without altering the function, as described in
      the next section.</dd>

<p class="Pp">Various styles are available using the standard shell style
    mechanism, described in <i>zshmodules</i>(1). Briefly, the command
    `<b>zstyle ':zftp:*'</b> <i>style</i> <i>value</i> ...'. defines the
    <i>style</i> to have value <i>value</i>; more than one value may be given,
    although that is not useful in the cases described here. These values will
    then be used throughout the zftp function system. For more precise control,
    the first argument, which gives a pattern that matches <i>contexts</i> in
    which the style applies, can be modified to include a particular function,
    as for example `<b>:zftp:zfget</b>': the style will then have the given
    value only in the <b>zfget</b> function, and will override styles set under
    `<b>:zftp:*</b>'. Note that only the top level function name, as called by
    the user, is used; calling of lower level functions is transparent to the
    user. Hence modifications to the title bar in <b>zftp_chpwd</b> use the
    contexts <b>:zftp:zfopen</b>, <b>:zftp:zfcd</b>, etc., depending where it
    was called from. The following styles are understood:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>progress</b></dt>
  <dd>Controls the way that <b>zftp_progress</b> reports on the progress of a
      transfer. If empty, unset, or `<b>none</b>', no progress report is made;
      if `<b>bar</b>' a growing bar of inverse video is shown; if
      `<b>percent</b>' (or any other string, though this may change in future),
      the percentage of the file transferred is shown. The bar meter requires
      that the width of the terminal be available via the <b>$COLUMNS</b>
      parameter (normally this is set automatically). If the size of the file
      being transferred is not available, <b>bar</b> and <b>percent</b> meters
      will simply show the number of bytes transferred so far.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">

<h2 class="Ss" id="Remote_globbing"><a class="permalink" href="#Remote_globbing">Remote
  globbing</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The commands for retrieving files usually perform filename
    generation (globbing) on their arguments; this can be turned off by passing
    the option <b>-G</b> to each of the commands. Normally this operates by
    retrieving a complete list of files for the directory in question, then
    matching these locally against the pattern supplied. This has the advantage
    that the full range of zsh patterns (respecting the setting of the option
    <b>EXTENDED_GLOB</b>) can be used. However, it means that the directory part
    of a filename will not be expanded and must be given exactly. If the remote
    server does not support the UNIX directory semantics, directory handling is
    problematic and it is recommended that globbing only be used within the
    current directory. The list of files in the current directory, if retrieved,
    will be cached, so that subsequent globs in the same directory without an
    intervening <b>zfcd</b> are much faster.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>remote-glob</b> style (see above) is set, globbing is
    instead performed on the remote host: the server is asked for a list of
    matching files. This is highly dependent on how the server is implemented,
    though typically UNIX servers will provide support for basic glob patterns.
    This may in some cases be faster, as it avoids retrieving the entire list of
    directory contents.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Automatic_and_temporary_reopening"><a class="permalink" href="#Automatic_and_temporary_reopening">Automatic
  and temporary reopening</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As described for the <b>zfopen</b> command, a subsequent
    <b>zfopen</b> with no parameters will reopen the connection to the last host
    (this includes connections made with the <b>zfanon</b> command). Opened in
    this fashion, the connection starts in the default remote directory and will
    remain open until explicitly closed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Automatic re-opening is also available. If a connection is not
    currently open and a command requiring a connection is given, the last
    connection is implicitly reopened. In this case the directory which was
    current when the connection was closed again becomes the current directory
    (unless, of course, the command given changes it). Automatic reopening will
    also take place if the connection was close by the remote server for
    whatever reason (e.g. a timeout). It is not available if the <b>-1</b>
    option to <b>zfopen</b> or <b>zfanon</b> was used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, if the command issued is a file transfer, the
    connection will be closed after the transfer is finished, hence providing a
    one-shot mode for transfers. This does not apply to directory changing or
    listing commands; for example a <b>zfdir</b> may reopen a connection but
    will leave it open. Also, automatic closure will only ever happen in the
    same command as automatic opening, i.e a <b>zfdir</b> directly followed by a
    <b>zfget</b> will never close the connection automatically.</p>
<p class="Pp">Information about the previous connection is given by the
    <b>zfstat</b> function. So, for example, if that reports:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre><b>Session:        default</b>
<b>Not connected.</b>
<b>Last session:   ftp.bar.com:/pub/textfiles</b></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">then the command <b>zfget file.txt</b> will attempt to reopen a
    connection to <b>ftp.bar.com</b>, retrieve the file
    <b>/pub/textfiles/file.txt</b>, and immediately close the connection again.
    On the other hand, <b>zfcd ..</b> will open the connection in the directory
    <b>/pub</b> and leave it open.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that all the above is local to each session; if you return to
    a previous session, the connection for that session is the one which will be
    reopened.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Completion"><a class="permalink" href="#Completion">Completion</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Completion of local and remote files, directories, sessions and
    bookmarks is supported. The older, <b>compctl</b>-style completion is
    defined when <b>zfinit</b> is called; support for the new widget-based
    completion system is provided in the function
    <b>Completion/Zsh/Command/_zftp</b>, which should be installed with the
    other functions of the completion system and hence should automatically be
    available.</p>
