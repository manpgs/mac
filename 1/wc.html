<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">wc</code> utility displays the number of
    lines, words, and bytes contained in each input <var class="Ar">file</var>,
    or standard input (if no file is specified) to the standard output. A line
    is defined as a string of characters delimited by a &#x27E8;newline&#x27E9;
    character. Characters beyond the final &#x27E8;newline&#x27E9; character
    will not be included in the line count.</p>
<p class="Pp">A word is defined as a string of characters delimited by white
    space characters. White space characters are the set of characters for which
    the <a class="Xr" href="../3/iswspace">iswspace(3)</a> function returns
    true. If more than one input file is specified, a line of cumulative counts
    for all the files is displayed on a separate line after the output for the
    last file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following options are available:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="c"><a class="permalink" href="#c"><code class="Fl">-c</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The number of bytes in each input file is written to the standard output.
      This will cancel out any prior usage of the <code class="Fl">-m</code>
      option.</dd>
  <dt id="l"><a class="permalink" href="#l"><code class="Fl">-l</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The number of lines in each input file is written to the standard
    output.</dd>
  <dt id="m"><a class="permalink" href="#m"><code class="Fl">-m</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The number of characters in each input file is written to the standard
      output. If the current locale does not support multibyte characters, this
      is equivalent to the <code class="Fl">-c</code> option. This will cancel
      out any prior usage of the <code class="Fl">-c</code> option.</dd>
  <dt id="w"><a class="permalink" href="#w"><code class="Fl">-w</code></a></dt>
  <dd>The number of words in each input file is written to the standard
    output.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When an option is specified, <code class="Nm">wc</code> only
    reports the information requested by that option. The order of output always
    takes the form of line, word, byte, and file name. The default action is
    equivalent to specifying the <code class="Fl">-c</code>,
    <code class="Fl">-l</code> and <code class="Fl">-w</code> options.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no files are specified, the standard input is used and no file
    name is displayed. The prompt will accept input until receiving EOF, or [^D]
    in most environments.</p>

<p class="Pp">Historically, the <code class="Nm">wc</code> utility was
    documented to define a word as a ``maximal string of characters delimited by
    &lt;space&gt;, &lt;tab&gt; or &lt;newline&gt; characters''. The
    implementation, however, did not handle non-printing characters correctly so
    that &#x201C;<code class="Li"> ^D^E </code>&#x201D; counted as 6 spaces,
    while &#x201C;<code class="Li">foo^D^Ebar</code>&#x201D; counted as 8
    characters. <span class="Ux">4BSD</span> systems after
    <span class="Ux">4.3BSD</span> modified the implementation to be consistent
    with the documentation. This implementation defines a ``word'' in terms of
    the <a class="Xr" href="../3/iswspace">iswspace(3)</a> function, as required
    by <span class="St">IEEE Std 1003.2 (&#x201C;POSIX.2&#x201D;)</span>.</p>
