<p class="Pp"><i>unzipsfx</i> is a modified version of <i>unzip</i>(1L) designed
    to be prepended to existing ZIP archives in order to form self-extracting
    archives. Instead of taking its first non-flag argument to be the zipfile(s)
    to be extracted, <i>unzipsfx</i> seeks itself under the name by which it was
    invoked and tests or extracts the contents of the appended archive. Because
    the executable stub adds bulk to the archive (the whole purpose of which is
    to be as small as possible), a number of the less-vital capabilities in
    regular <i>unzip</i> have been removed. Among these are the usage (or help)
    screen, the listing and diagnostic functions (<b>-l</b> and <b>-v</b>), the
    ability to decompress older compression formats (the ``reduce,'' ``shrink''
    and ``implode'' methods). The ability to extract to a directory other than
    the current one can be selected as a compile-time option, which is now
    enabled by default since UnZipSFX version 5.5. Similarly, decryption is
    supported as a compile-time option but should be avoided unless the attached
    archive contains encrypted files. Starting with release 5.5, another
    compile-time option adds a simple ``run command after extraction'' feature.
    This feature is currently incompatible with the ``extract to different
    directory'' feature and remains disabled by default.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Note that</b> <b>self-extracting archives made with</b>
    <i>unzipsfx</i> <b>are no more (or less)</b> <b>portable across different
    operating systems than is</b> <b>the</b> <i>unzip</i> <b>executable
    itself.</b> In general a self-extracting archive made on a particular Unix
    system, for example, will only self-extract under the same flavor of Unix.
    Regular <i>unzip</i> may still be used to extract the embedded archive as
    with any normal zipfile, although it will generate a harmless warning about
    extra bytes at the beginning of the zipfile. <i>Despite this</i>, however,
    the self-extracting archive is technically <i>not</i> a valid ZIP archive,
    and PKUNZIP may be unable to test or extract it. This limitation is due to
    the simplistic manner in which the archive is created; the internal
    directory structure is not updated to reflect the extra bytes prepended to
    the original zipfile.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ARGUMENTS"><a class="permalink" href="#ARGUMENTS">ARGUMENTS</a></h1>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[<i>file(s)</i>]</dt>
  <dd>An optional list of archive members to be processed. Regular expressions
      (wildcards) similar to those in Unix <i>egrep</i>(1) may be used to match
      multiple members. These wildcards may contain:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>*</dt>
  <dd>matches a sequence of 0 or more characters</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>?</dt>
  <dd>matches exactly 1 character</dd>
  <dt>[...]</dt>
  <dd>matches any single character found inside the brackets; ranges are
      specified by a beginning character, a hyphen, and an ending character. If
      an exclamation point or a caret (`!' or `^') follows the left bracket,
      then the range of characters within the brackets is complemented (that is,
      anything <i>except</i> the characters inside the brackets is considered a
      match).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>(Be sure to quote any character that might otherwise be interpreted or
      modified by the operating system, particularly under Unix and VMS.)</dd>
  <dt>[<b>-x</b>&#x00A0;<i>xfile(s)</i>]</dt>
  <dd>An optional list of archive members to be excluded from processing. Since
      wildcard characters match directory separators (`/'), this option may be
      used to exclude any files that are in subdirectories. For example,
      ``foosfx *.[ch] -x */*'' would extract all C source files in the main
      directory, but none in any subdirectories. Without the <b>-x</b> option,
      all C source files in all directories within the zipfile would be
      extracted.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If <i>unzipsfx</i> is compiled with SFX_EXDIR defined, the
    following option is also enabled:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[<b>-d</b>&#x00A0;<i>exdir</i>]</dt>
  <dd>An optional directory to which to extract files. By default, all files and
      subdirectories are recreated in the current directory; the <b>-d</b>
      option allows extraction in an arbitrary directory (always assuming one
      has permission to write to the directory). The option and directory may be
      concatenated without any white space between them, but note that this may
      cause normal shell behavior to be suppressed. In particular,
      ``-d&#x00A0;~'' (tilde) is expanded by Unix C shells into the name of the
      user's home directory, but ``-d~'' is treated as a literal subdirectory
      ``<b>~</b>'' of the current directory.</dd>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>unzipsfx</i> supports the following <i>unzip</i>(1L) options:
    <b>-c</b> and <b>-p</b> (extract to standard output/screen), <b>-f</b> and
    <b>-u</b> (freshen and update existing files upon extraction), <b>-t</b>
    (test archive) and <b>-z</b> (print archive comment). All normal listing
    options (<b>-l</b>, <b>-v</b> and <b>-Z</b>) have been removed, but the
    testing option (<b>-t</b>) may be used as a ``poor man's'' listing.
    Alternatively, those creating self-extracting archives may wish to include a
    short listing in the zipfile comment.</p>
<p class="Pp">See <i>unzip</i>(1L) for a more complete description of these
    options.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="MODIFIERS"><a class="permalink" href="#MODIFIERS">MODIFIERS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>unzipsfx</i> currently supports all <i>unzip</i>(1L) modifiers:
    <b>-a</b> (convert text files), <b>-n</b> (never overwrite), <b>-o</b>
    (overwrite without prompting), <b>-q</b> (operate quietly), <b>-C</b> (match
    names case-insensitively), <b>-L</b> (convert uppercase-OS names to
    lowercase), <b>-j</b> (junk paths) and <b>-V</b> (retain version numbers);
    plus the following operating-system specific options: <b>-X</b> (restore VMS
    owner/protection info), <b>-s</b> (convert spaces in filenames to
    underscores [DOS, OS/2, NT]) and <b>-$</b> (restore volume label [DOS, OS/2,
    NT, Amiga]).</p>
<p class="Pp">(Support for regular ASCII text-conversion may be removed in
    future versions, since it is simple enough for the archive's creator to
    ensure that text files have the appropriate format for the local OS. EBCDIC
    conversion will of course continue to be supported since the zipfile format
    implies ASCII storage of text files.)</p>
<p class="Pp">See <i>unzip</i>(1L) for a more complete description of these
    modifiers.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT_OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#ENVIRONMENT_OPTIONS">ENVIRONMENT
  OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><i>unzipsfx</i> uses the same environment variables as
    <i>unzip</i>(1L) does, although this is likely to be an issue only for the
    person creating and testing the self-extracting archive. See
    <i>unzip</i>(1L) for details.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DECRYPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DECRYPTION">DECRYPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Decryption is supported exactly as in <i>unzip</i>(1L); that is,
    interactively with a non-echoing prompt for the password(s). See
    <i>unzip</i>(1L) for details. Once again, note that if the archive has no
    encrypted files there is no reason to use a version of <i>unzipsfx</i> with
    decryption support; that only adds to the size of the archive.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="AUTORUN_COMMAND"><a class="permalink" href="#AUTORUN_COMMAND">AUTORUN
  COMMAND</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When <i>unzipsfx</i> was compiled with CHEAP_SFX_AUTORUN defined,
    a simple ``command autorun'' feature is supported. You may enter a command
    into the Zip archive comment, using the following format:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
$AUTORUN$&gt;[command line string]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When <i>unzipsfx</i> recognizes the ``$AUTORUN$&gt;'' token at the
    beginning of the Zip archive comment, the remainder of the first line of the
    comment (until the first newline character) is passed as a shell command to
    the operating system using the C rtl ``system'' function. Before executing
    the command, <i>unzipsfx</i> displays the command on the console and prompts
    the user for confirmation. When the user has switched off prompting by
    specifying the <b>-q</b> option, autorun commands are never executed.</p>
<p class="Pp">In case the archive comment contains additional lines of text, the
    remainder of the archive comment following the first line is displayed
    normally, unless quiet operation was requested by supplying a <b>-q</b>
    option.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">To create a self-extracting archive <i>letters</i> from a regular
    zipfile <i>letters.zip</i> and change the new archive's permissions to be
    world-executable under Unix:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
cat unzipsfx letters.zip &gt; letters
chmod 755 letters
zip -A letters
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To create the same archive under MS-DOS, OS/2 or NT (note the use
    of the <b>/b</b> [binary] option to the <i>copy</i> command):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
copy /b unzipsfx.exe+letters.zip letters.exe
zip -A letters.exe
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Under VMS:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
copy unzipsfx.exe,letters.zip letters.exe
letters == &quot;$currentdisk:[currentdir]letters.exe&quot;
zip -A letters.exe
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(The VMS <i>append</i> command may also be used. The second
    command installs the new program as a ``foreign command'' capable of taking
    arguments. The third line assumes that Zip is already installed as a foreign
    command.) Under AmigaDOS:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
MakeSFX letters letters.zip UnZipSFX
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(MakeSFX is included with the UnZip source distribution and with
    Amiga binary distributions. ``zip -A'' doesn't work on Amiga self-extracting
    archives.) To test (or list) the newly created self-extracting archive:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
letters -t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To test <i>letters</i> quietly, printing only a summary message
    indicating whether the archive is OK or not:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
letters -tqq
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To extract the complete contents into the current directory,
    recreating all files and subdirectories as necessary:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
letters
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To extract all *.txt files (in Unix quote the `*'):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
letters *.txt
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To extract everything <i>except</i> the *.txt files:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
letters -x *.txt
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To extract only the README file to standard output (the
  screen):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
letters -c README
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To print only the zipfile comment:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
letters -z

<h1 class="Sh" id="LIMITATIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The principle and fundamental limitation of <i>unzipsfx</i> is
    that it is not portable across architectures or operating systems, and
    therefore neither are the resulting archives. For some architectures there
    is limited portability, however (e.g., between some flavors of Intel-based
    Unix).</p>
<p class="Pp">Another problem with the current implementation is that any
    archive with ``junk'' prepended to the beginning technically is no longer a
    zipfile (unless <i>zip</i>(1) is used to adjust the zipfile offsets
    appropriately, as noted above). <i>unzip</i>(1) takes note of the prepended
    bytes and ignores them since some file-transfer protocols, notably
    MacBinary, are also known to prepend junk. But PKWARE's archiver suite may
    not be able to deal with the modified archive unless its offsets have been
    adjusted.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>unzipsfx</i> has no knowledge of the user's PATH, so in general
    an archive must either be in the current directory when it is invoked, or
    else a full or relative path must be given. If a user attempts to extract
    the archive from a directory in the PATH other than the current one,
    <i>unzipsfx</i> will print a warning to the effect, ``can't find myself.''
    This is always true under Unix and may be true in some cases under MS-DOS,
    depending on the compiler used (Microsoft C fully qualifies the program
    name, but other compilers may not). Under OS/2 and NT there are
    operating-system calls available that provide the full path name, so the
    archive may be invoked from anywhere in the user's path. The situation is
    not known for AmigaDOS, Atari TOS, MacOS, etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">As noted above, a number of the normal <i>unzip</i>(1L) functions
    have been removed in order to make <i>unzipsfx</i> smaller: usage and
    diagnostic info, listing functions and extraction to other directories.
    Also, only stored and deflated files are supported. The latter limitation is
    mainly relevant to those who create SFX archives, however.</p>
<p class="Pp">VMS users must know how to set up self-extracting archives as
    foreign commands in order to use any of <i>unzipsfx</i>'s options. This is
    not necessary for simple extraction, but the command to do so then becomes,
    e.g., ``run letters'' (to continue the examples given above).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>unzipsfx</i> on the Amiga requires the use of a special
    program, MakeSFX, in order to create working self-extracting archives;
    simple concatenation does not work. (For technically oriented users, the
    attached archive is defined as a ``debug hunk.'') There may be compatibility
    problems between the ROM levels of older Amigas and newer ones.</p>
<p class="Pp">All current bugs in <i>unzip</i>(1L) exist in <i>unzipsfx</i> as
    well.</p>
