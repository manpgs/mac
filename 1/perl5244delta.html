<p class="Pp">Perl 5.24.4 represents approximately 7 months of development since
    Perl 5.24.3 and contains approximately 2,400 lines of changes across 49
    files from 12 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 1,300 lines of changes to 12 .pm, .t, .c and .h
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.24.4:</p>
<p class="Pp">Abigail, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, John SJ Anderson, Karen
    Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Renee Baecker, Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Todd
    Rinaldo, Tony Cook, Yves Orton, Zefram.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
    please see the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<p class="Pp">If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
    recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
    database at &lt;https://rt.perl.org/&gt; . There may also be information at

<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then see
