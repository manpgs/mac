<p class="Pp">Before release 5 of Perl it was difficult to represent complex
    data structures, because all references had to be symbolic--and even then it
    was difficult to refer to a variable instead of a symbol table entry. Perl
    now not only makes it easier to use symbolic references to variables, but
    also lets you have &quot;hard&quot; references to any piece of data or code.
    Any scalar may hold a hard reference. Because arrays and hashes contain
    scalars, you can now easily build arrays of arrays, arrays of hashes, hashes
    of arrays, arrays of hashes of functions, and so on.</p>
<p class="Pp">Hard references are smart--they keep track of reference counts for
    you, automatically freeing the thing referred to when its reference count
    goes to zero. (Reference counts for values in self-referential or cyclic
    data structures may not go to zero without a little help; see &quot;Circular
    References&quot; for a detailed explanation.) If that thing happens to be an
    object, the object is destructed. See perlobj for more about objects. (In a
    sense, everything in Perl is an object, but we usually reserve the word for
    references to objects that have been officially &quot;blessed&quot; into a
    class package.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Symbolic references are names of variables or other objects, just
    as a symbolic link in a Unix filesystem contains merely the name of a file.
    The <span class="Li">*glob</span> notation is something of a symbolic
    reference. (Symbolic references are sometimes called &quot;soft
    references&quot;, but please don't call them that; references are confusing
    enough without useless synonyms.)</p>
<p class="Pp">In contrast, hard references are more like hard links in a Unix
    file system: They are used to access an underlying object without concern
    for what its (other) name is. When the word &quot;reference&quot; is used
    without an adjective, as in the following paragraph, it is usually talking
    about a hard reference.</p>
<p class="Pp">References are easy to use in Perl. There is just one overriding
    principle: in general, Perl does no implicit referencing or dereferencing.
    When a scalar is holding a reference, it always behaves as a simple scalar.
    It doesn't magically start being an array or hash or subroutine; you have to
    tell it explicitly to do so, by dereferencing it.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Making_References"><a class="permalink" href="#Making_References">Making
  References</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">References can be created in several ways.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Backslash Operator</i></p>
<p class="Pp">By using the backslash operator on a variable, subroutine, or
    value. (This works much like the &amp; (address-of) operator in C.) This
    typically creates <i>another</i> reference to a variable, because there's
    already a reference to the variable in the symbol table. But the symbol
    table reference might go away, and you'll still have the reference that the
    backslash returned. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $scalarref = \$foo;
    $arrayref  = \@ARGV;
    $hashref   = \%ENV;
    $coderef   = \&amp;handler;
    $globref   = \*foo;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It isn't possible to create a true reference to an IO handle
    (filehandle or dirhandle) using the backslash operator. The most you can get
    is a reference to a typeglob, which is actually a complete symbol table
    entry. But see the explanation of the <span class="Li">*foo{THING}</span>
    syntax below. However, you can still use type globs and globrefs as though
    they were IO handles.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Square Brackets</i></p>
<p class="Pp">A reference to an anonymous array can be created using square
    brackets:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $arrayref = [1, 2, ['a', 'b', 'c']];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here we've created a reference to an anonymous array of three
    elements whose final element is itself a reference to another anonymous
    array of three elements. (The multidimensional syntax described later can be
    used to access this. For example, after the above,
    <span class="Li">&quot;$arrayref-&gt;[2][1]&quot;</span> would have the
    value &quot;b&quot;.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Taking a reference to an enumerated list is not the same as using
    square brackets--instead it's the same as creating a list of references!</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    @list = (\$a, \@b, \%c);
    @list = \($a, @b, %c);      # same thing!
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As a special case, <span class="Li">&quot;\(@foo)&quot;</span>
    returns a list of references to the contents of
    <span class="Li">@foo</span>, not a reference to
    <span class="Li">@foo</span> itself. Likewise for
    <span class="Li">%foo</span>, except that the key references are to copies
    (since the keys are just strings rather than full-fledged scalars).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Curly Brackets</i></p>
<p class="Pp">A reference to an anonymous hash can be created using curly
    brackets:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $hashref = {
        'Adam'  =&gt; 'Eve',
        'Clyde' =&gt; 'Bonnie',
    };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Anonymous hash and array composers like these can be intermixed
    freely to produce as complicated a structure as you want. The
    multidimensional syntax described below works for these too. The values
    above are literals, but variables and expressions would work just as well,
    because assignment operators in Perl (even within <b>local()</b> or
    <b>my()</b>) are executable statements, not compile-time declarations.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because curly brackets (braces) are used for several other things
    including BLOCKs, you may occasionally have to disambiguate braces at the
    beginning of a statement by putting a <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span>
    or a <span class="Li">&quot;return&quot;</span> in front so that Perl
    realizes the opening brace isn't starting a BLOCK. The economy and mnemonic
    value of using curlies is deemed worth this occasional extra hassle.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, if you wanted a function to make a new hash and
    return a reference to it, you have these options:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    sub hashem {        { @_ } }   # silently wrong
    sub hashem {       +{ @_ } }   # ok
    sub hashem { return { @_ } }   # ok
</pre>
<p class="Pp">On the other hand, if you want the other meaning, you can do
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    sub showem {        { @_ } }   # ambiguous (currently ok,
                                   # but may change)
    sub showem {       {; @_ } }   # ok
    sub showem { { return @_ } }   # ok
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The leading <span class="Li">&quot;+{&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;{;&quot;</span> always serve to disambiguate the
    expression to mean either the HASH reference, or the BLOCK.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Anonymous Subroutines</i></p>
<p class="Pp">A reference to an anonymous subroutine can be created by using
    <span class="Li">&quot;sub&quot;</span> without a subname:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $coderef = sub { print &quot;Boink!\n&quot; };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note the semicolon. Except for the code inside not being
    immediately executed, a <span class="Li">&quot;sub {}&quot;</span> is not so
    much a declaration as it is an operator, like
    <span class="Li">&quot;do{}&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval{}&quot;</span>. (However, no matter how many
    times you execute that particular line (unless you're in an
    <span class="Li">&quot;eval(&quot;...&quot;)&quot;</span>),
    <span class="Li">$coderef</span> will still have a reference to the
    <i>same</i> anonymous subroutine.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Anonymous subroutines act as closures with respect to <b>my()</b>
    variables, that is, variables lexically visible within the current scope.
    Closure is a notion out of the Lisp world that says if you define an
    anonymous function in a particular lexical context, it pretends to run in
    that context even when it's called outside the context.</p>
<p class="Pp">In human terms, it's a funny way of passing arguments to a
    subroutine when you define it as well as when you call it. It's useful for
    setting up little bits of code to run later, such as callbacks. You can even
    do object-oriented stuff with it, though Perl already provides a different
    mechanism to do that--see perlobj.</p>
<p class="Pp">You might also think of closure as a way to write a subroutine
    template without using <b>eval()</b>. Here's a small example of how closures
    work:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    sub newprint {
        my $x = shift;
        return sub { my $y = shift; print &quot;$x, $y!\n&quot;; };
    }
    $h = newprint(&quot;Howdy&quot;);
    $g = newprint(&quot;Greetings&quot;);
    # Time passes...
    &amp;$h(&quot;world&quot;);
    &amp;$g(&quot;earthlings&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This prints</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    Howdy, world!
    Greetings, earthlings!
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note particularly that <span class="Li">$x</span> continues to
    refer to the value passed into <b>newprint()</b> <i>despite</i> &quot;my
    <span class="Li">$x</span>&quot; having gone out of scope by the time the
    anonymous subroutine runs. That's what a closure is all about.</p>
<p class="Pp">This applies only to lexical variables, by the way. Dynamic
    variables continue to work as they have always worked. Closure is not
    something that most Perl programmers need trouble themselves about to begin
    with.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Constructors</i></p>
<p class="Pp">References are often returned by special subroutines called
    constructors. Perl objects are just references to a special type of object
    that happens to know which package it's associated with. Constructors are
    just special subroutines that know how to create that association. They do
    so by starting with an ordinary reference, and it remains an ordinary
    reference even while it's also being an object. Constructors are often named
    <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span>. You <i>can</i> call them
    indirectly:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $objref = new Doggie( Tail =&gt; 'short', Ears =&gt; 'long' );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But that can produce ambiguous syntax in certain cases, so it's
    often better to use the direct method invocation approach:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $objref   = Doggie-&gt;new(Tail =&gt; 'short', Ears =&gt; 'long');
    use Term::Cap;
    $terminal = Term::Cap-&gt;Tgetent( { OSPEED =&gt; 9600 });
    use Tk;
    $main    = MainWindow-&gt;new();
    $menubar = $main-&gt;Frame(-relief              =&gt; &quot;raised&quot;,
                            -borderwidth         =&gt; 2)
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Autovivification</i></p>
<p class="Pp">References of the appropriate type can spring into existence if
    you dereference them in a context that assumes they exist. Because we
    haven't talked about dereferencing yet, we can't show you any examples
  yet.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Typeglob Slots</i></p>
<p class="Pp">A reference can be created by using a special syntax, lovingly
    known as the *foo{THING} syntax. *foo{THING} returns a reference to the
    THING slot in *foo (which is the symbol table entry which holds everything
    known as foo).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $scalarref = *foo{SCALAR};
    $arrayref  = *ARGV{ARRAY};
    $hashref   = *ENV{HASH};
    $coderef   = *handler{CODE};
    $ioref     = *STDIN{IO};
    $globref   = *foo{GLOB};
    $formatref = *foo{FORMAT};
    $globname  = *foo{NAME};    # &quot;foo&quot;
    $pkgname   = *foo{PACKAGE}; # &quot;main&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Most of these are self-explanatory, but
    <span class="Li">*foo{IO}</span> deserves special attention. It returns the
    IO handle, used for file handles (&quot;open&quot; in perlfunc), sockets
    (&quot;socket&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;socketpair&quot; in perlfunc), and
    directory handles (&quot;opendir&quot; in perlfunc). For compatibility with
    previous versions of Perl, <span class="Li">*foo{FILEHANDLE}</span> is a
    synonym for <span class="Li">*foo{IO}</span>, though it is discouraged, to
    encourage a consistent use of one name: IO. On perls between v5.8 and v5.22,
    it will issue a deprecation warning, but this deprecation has since been
    rescinded.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">*foo{THING}</span> returns undef if that
    particular THING hasn't been used yet, except in the case of scalars.
    <span class="Li">*foo{SCALAR}</span> returns a reference to an anonymous
    scalar if <span class="Li">$foo</span> hasn't been used yet. This might
    change in a future release.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">*foo{NAME}</span> and
    <span class="Li">*foo{PACKAGE}</span> are the exception, in that they return
    strings, rather than references. These return the package and name of the
    typeglob itself, rather than one that has been assigned to it. So, after
    <span class="Li">&quot;*foo=*Foo::bar&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">*foo</span> will become &quot;*Foo::bar&quot; when used as
    a string, but <span class="Li">*foo{PACKAGE}</span> and
    <span class="Li">*foo{NAME}</span> will continue to produce &quot;main&quot;
    and &quot;foo&quot;, respectively.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">*foo{IO}</span> is an alternative to the
    <span class="Li">*HANDLE</span> mechanism given in &quot;Typeglobs and
    Filehandles&quot; in perldata for passing filehandles into or out of
    subroutines, or storing into larger data structures. Its disadvantage is
    that it won't create a new filehandle for you. Its advantage is that you
    have less risk of clobbering more than you want to with a typeglob
    assignment. (It still conflates file and directory handles, though.)
    However, if you assign the incoming value to a scalar instead of a typeglob
    as we do in the examples below, there's no risk of that happening.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    splutter(*STDOUT);          # pass the whole glob
    splutter(*STDOUT{IO});      # pass both file and dir handles
    sub splutter {
        my $fh = shift;
        print $fh &quot;her um well a hmmm\n&quot;;
    }
    $rec = get_rec(*STDIN);     # pass the whole glob
    $rec = get_rec(*STDIN{IO}); # pass both file and dir handles
    sub get_rec {
        my $fh = shift;
        return scalar &lt;$fh&gt;;
    }
</pre>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Using_References"><a class="permalink" href="#Using_References">Using
  References</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">That's it for creating references. By now you're probably dying to
    know how to use references to get back to your long-lost data. There are
    several basic methods.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Simple Scalar</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Anywhere you'd put an identifier (or chain of identifiers) as part
    of a variable or subroutine name, you can replace the identifier with a
    simple scalar variable containing a reference of the correct type:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $bar = $$scalarref;
    push(@$arrayref, $filename);
    $$arrayref[0] = &quot;January&quot;;
    $$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;
    &amp;$coderef(1,2,3);
    print $globref &quot;output\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It's important to understand that we are specifically <i>not</i>
    dereferencing <span class="Li">$arrayref[0]</span> or
    <span class="Li">$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;}</span> there. The dereference of
    the scalar variable happens <i>before</i> it does any key lookups. Anything
    more complicated than a simple scalar variable must use methods 2 or 3
    below. However, a &quot;simple scalar&quot; includes an identifier that
    itself uses method 1 recursively. Therefore, the following prints
    &quot;howdy&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $refrefref = \\\&quot;howdy&quot;;
    print $$$$refrefref;
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><i>Block</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Anywhere you'd put an identifier (or chain of identifiers) as part
    of a variable or subroutine name, you can replace the identifier with a
    BLOCK returning a reference of the correct type. In other words, the
    previous examples could be written like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $bar = ${$scalarref};
    push(@{$arrayref}, $filename);
    ${$arrayref}[0] = &quot;January&quot;;
    ${$hashref}{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;
    &amp;{$coderef}(1,2,3);
    $globref-&gt;print(&quot;output\n&quot;);  # iff IO::Handle is loaded
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Admittedly, it's a little silly to use the curlies in this case,
    but the BLOCK can contain any arbitrary expression, in particular,
    subscripted expressions:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    &amp;{ $dispatch{$index} }(1,2,3);      # call correct routine
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Because of being able to omit the curlies for the simple case of
    <span class="Li">$$x</span>, people often make the mistake of viewing the
    dereferencing symbols as proper operators, and wonder about their
    precedence. If they were, though, you could use parentheses instead of
    braces. That's not the case. Consider the difference below; case 0 is a
    short-hand version of case 1, <i>not</i> case 2:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;}   = &quot;VALUE&quot;;       # CASE 0
    ${$hashref}{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;       # CASE 1
    ${$hashref{&quot;KEY&quot;}} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;       # CASE 2
    ${$hashref-&gt;{&quot;KEY&quot;}} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;     # CASE 3
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Case 2 is also deceptive in that you're accessing a variable
    called <span class="Li">%hashref</span>, not dereferencing through
    <span class="Li">$hashref</span> to the hash it's presumably referencing.
    That would be case 3.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Arrow Notation</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Subroutine calls and lookups of individual array elements arise
    often enough that it gets cumbersome to use method 2. As a form of syntactic
    sugar, the examples for method 2 may be written:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $arrayref-&gt;[0] = &quot;January&quot;;   # Array element
    $hashref-&gt;{&quot;KEY&quot;} = &quot;VALUE&quot;;  # Hash element
    $coderef-&gt;(1,2,3);            # Subroutine call
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The left side of the arrow can be any expression returning a
    reference, including a previous dereference. Note that
    <span class="Li">$array[$x]</span> is <i>not</i> the same thing as
    <span class="Li">&quot;$array-&gt;[$x]&quot;</span> here:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $array[$x]-&gt;{&quot;foo&quot;}-&gt;[0] = &quot;January&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is one of the cases we mentioned earlier in which references
    could spring into existence when in an lvalue context. Before this
    statement, <span class="Li">$array[$x]</span> may have been undefined. If
    so, it's automatically defined with a hash reference so that we can look up
    <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;foo&quot;}&quot;</span> in it. Likewise
    <span class="Li">&quot;$array[$x]-&gt;{&quot;foo&quot;}&quot;</span> will
    automatically get defined with an array reference so that we can look up
    <span class="Li">&quot;[0]&quot;</span> in it. This process is called
    <i>autovivification</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">One more thing here. The arrow is optional <i>between</i> brackets
    subscripts, so you can shrink the above down to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $array[$x]{&quot;foo&quot;}[0] = &quot;January&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Which, in the degenerate case of using only ordinary arrays, gives
    you multidimensional arrays just like C's:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $score[$x][$y][$z] += 42;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Well, okay, not entirely like C's arrays, actually. C doesn't know
    how to grow its arrays on demand. Perl does.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Objects</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If a reference happens to be a reference to an object, then there
    are probably methods to access the things referred to, and you should
    probably stick to those methods unless you're in the class package that
    defines the object's methods. In other words, be nice, and don't violate the
    object's encapsulation without a very good reason. Perl does not enforce
    encapsulation. We are not totalitarians here. We do expect some basic
    civility though.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Miscellaneous Usage</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Using a string or number as a reference produces a symbolic
    reference, as explained above. Using a reference as a number produces an
    integer representing its storage location in memory. The only useful thing
    to be done with this is to compare two references numerically to see whether
    they refer to the same location.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    if ($ref1 == $ref2) {  # cheap numeric compare of references
        print &quot;refs 1 and 2 refer to the same thing\n&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Using a reference as a string produces both its referent's type,
    including any package blessing as described in perlobj, as well as the
    numeric address expressed in hex. The <b>ref()</b> operator returns just the
    type of thing the reference is pointing to, without the address. See
    &quot;ref&quot; in perlfunc for details and examples of its use.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>bless()</b> operator may be used to associate the object a
    reference points to with a package functioning as an object class. See
    perlobj.</p>
<p class="Pp">A typeglob may be dereferenced the same way a reference can,
    because the dereference syntax always indicates the type of reference
    desired. So <span class="Li">&quot;${*foo}&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;${\$foo}&quot;</span> both indicate the same scalar
    variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's a trick for interpolating a subroutine call into a
  string:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print &quot;My sub returned @{[mysub(1,2,3)]} that time.\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The way it works is that when the
    <span class="Li">&quot;@{...}&quot;</span> is seen in the double-quoted
    string, it's evaluated as a block. The block creates a reference to an
    anonymous array containing the results of the call to
    <span class="Li">&quot;mysub(1,2,3)&quot;</span>. So the whole block returns
    a reference to an array, which is then dereferenced by
    <span class="Li">&quot;@{...}&quot;</span> and stuck into the double-quoted
    string. This chicanery is also useful for arbitrary expressions:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print &quot;That yields @{[$n + 5]} widgets\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, an expression that returns a reference to a scalar can
    be dereferenced via <span class="Li">&quot;${...}&quot;</span>. Thus, the
    above expression may be written as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print &quot;That yields ${\($n + 5)} widgets\n&quot;;

<h2 class="Ss" id="Circular_References"><a class="permalink" href="#Circular_References">Circular
  References</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">It is possible to create a &quot;circular reference&quot; in Perl,
    which can lead to memory leaks. A circular reference occurs when two
    references contain a reference to each other, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $foo = {};
    my $bar = { foo =&gt; $foo };
    $foo-&gt;{bar} = $bar;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can also create a circular reference with a single
  variable:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    my $foo;
    $foo = \$foo;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In this case, the reference count for the variables will never
    reach 0, and the references will never be garbage-collected. This can lead
    to memory leaks.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because objects in Perl are implemented as references, it's
    possible to have circular references with objects as well. Imagine a
    TreeNode class where each node references its parent and child nodes. Any
    node with a parent will be part of a circular reference.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can break circular references by creating a &quot;weak
    reference&quot;. A weak reference does not increment the reference count for
    a variable, which means that the object can go out of scope and be
    destroyed. You can weaken a reference with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;weaken&quot;</span> function exported by the
    Scalar::Util module.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here's how we can make the first example safer:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use Scalar::Util 'weaken';
    my $foo = {};
    my $bar = { foo =&gt; $foo };
    $foo-&gt;{bar} = $bar;
    weaken $foo-&gt;{bar};
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The reference from <span class="Li">$foo</span> to
    <span class="Li">$bar</span> has been weakened. When the
    <span class="Li">$bar</span> variable goes out of scope, it will be
    garbage-collected. The next time you look at the value of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;$foo-&gt;{bar}&quot;</span> key, it will be
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">This action at a distance can be confusing, so you should be
    careful with your use of weaken. You should weaken the reference in the
    variable that will go out of scope <i>first</i>. That way, the longer-lived
    variable will contain the expected reference until it goes out of scope.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Symbolic_references"><a class="permalink" href="#Symbolic_references">Symbolic
  references</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">We said that references spring into existence as necessary if they
    are undefined, but we didn't say what happens if a value used as a reference
    is already defined, but <i>isn't</i> a hard reference. If you use it as a
    reference, it'll be treated as a symbolic reference. That is, the value of
    the scalar is taken to be the <i>name</i> of a variable, rather than a
    direct link to a (possibly) anonymous value.</p>
<p class="Pp">People frequently expect it to work like this. So it does.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $name = &quot;foo&quot;;
    $$name = 1;                 # Sets $foo
    ${$name} = 2;               # Sets $foo
    ${$name x 2} = 3;           # Sets $foofoo
    $name-&gt;[0] = 4;             # Sets $foo[0]
    @$name = ();                # Clears @foo
    &amp;$name();                   # Calls &amp;foo()
    $pack = &quot;THAT&quot;;
    ${&quot;${pack}::$name&quot;} = 5;    # Sets $THAT::foo without eval
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is powerful, and slightly dangerous, in that it's possible to
    intend (with the utmost sincerity) to use a hard reference, and accidentally
    use a symbolic reference instead. To protect against that, you can say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use strict 'refs';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and then only hard references will be allowed for the rest of the
    enclosing block. An inner block may countermand that with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    no strict 'refs';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Only package variables (globals, even if localized) are visible to
    symbolic references. Lexical variables (declared with <b>my()</b>) aren't in
    a symbol table, and thus are invisible to this mechanism. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    local $value = 10;
    $ref = &quot;value&quot;;
    {
        my $value = 20;
        print $$ref;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will still print 10, not 20. Remember that <b>local()</b>
    affects package variables, which are all &quot;global&quot; to the
  package.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Not-so-symbolic_references"><a class="permalink" href="#Not-so-symbolic_references">Not-so-symbolic
  references</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Brackets around a symbolic reference can simply serve to isolate
    an identifier or variable name from the rest of an expression, just as they
    always have within a string. For example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $push = &quot;pop on &quot;;
    print &quot;${push}over&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">has always meant to print &quot;pop on over&quot;, even though
    push is a reserved word. This is generalized to work the same without the
    enclosing double quotes, so that</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print ${push} . &quot;over&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and even</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print ${ push } . &quot;over&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will have the same effect. This construct is <i>not</i> considered
    to be a symbolic reference when you're using strict refs:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    use strict 'refs';
    ${ bareword };      # Okay, means $bareword.
    ${ &quot;bareword&quot; };    # Error, symbolic reference.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, because of all the subscripting that is done using
    single words, the same rule applies to any bareword that is used for
    subscripting a hash. So now, instead of writing</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $hash{ &quot;aaa&quot; }{ &quot;bbb&quot; }{ &quot;ccc&quot; }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">you can write just</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $hash{ aaa }{ bbb }{ ccc }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and not worry about whether the subscripts are reserved words. In
    the rare event that you do wish to do something like</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $hash{ shift }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">you can force interpretation as a reserved word by adding anything
    that makes it more than a bareword:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $hash{ shift() }
    $hash{ +shift }
    $hash{ shift @_ }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;use warnings&quot;</span> pragma or the
    <b>-w</b> switch will warn you if it interprets a reserved word as a string.
    But it will no longer warn you about using lowercase words, because the
    string is effectively quoted.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Function_Templates"><a class="permalink" href="#Function_Templates">Function
  Templates</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As explained above, an anonymous function with access to the
    lexical variables visible when that function was compiled, creates a
    closure. It retains access to those variables even though it doesn't get run
    until later, such as in a signal handler or a Tk callback.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using a closure as a function template allows us to generate many
    functions that act similarly. Suppose you wanted functions named after the
    colors that generated HTML font changes for the various colors:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    print &quot;Be &quot;, red(&quot;careful&quot;), &quot;with that &quot;, green(&quot;light&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <b>red()</b> and <b>green()</b> functions would be similar. To
    create these, we'll assign a closure to a typeglob of the name of the
    function we're trying to build.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    @colors = qw(red blue green yellow orange purple violet);
    for my $name (@colors) {
        no strict 'refs';       # allow symbol table manipulation
        *$name = *{uc $name} = sub { &quot;&lt;FONT COLOR='$name'&gt;@_&lt;/FONT&gt;&quot; };
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now all those different functions appear to exist independently.
    You can call <b>red()</b>, <b>RED()</b>, <b>blue()</b>, <b>BLUE()</b>,
    <b>green()</b>, etc. This technique saves on both compile time and memory
    use, and is less error-prone as well, since syntax checks happen at compile
    time. It's critical that any variables in the anonymous subroutine be
    lexicals in order to create a proper closure. That's the reasons for the
    <span class="Li">&quot;my&quot;</span> on the loop iteration variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is one of the only places where giving a prototype to a
    closure makes much sense. If you wanted to impose scalar context on the
    arguments of these functions (probably not a wise idea for this particular
    example), you could have written it this way instead:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    *$name = sub ($) { &quot;&lt;FONT COLOR='$name'&gt;$_[0]&lt;/FONT&gt;&quot; };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, since prototype checking happens at compile time, the
    assignment above happens too late to be of much use. You could address this
    by putting the whole loop of assignments within a BEGIN block, forcing it to
    occur during compilation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Access to lexicals that change over time--like those in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;for&quot;</span> loop above, basically aliases to
    elements from the surrounding lexical scopes-- only works with anonymous
    subs, not with named subroutines. Generally said, named subroutines do not
    nest properly and should only be declared in the main package scope.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is because named subroutines are created at compile time so
    their lexical variables get assigned to the parent lexicals from the first
    execution of the parent block. If a parent scope is entered a second time,
    its lexicals are created again, while the nested subs still reference the
    old ones.</p>
<p class="Pp">Anonymous subroutines get to capture each time you execute the
    <span class="Li">&quot;sub&quot;</span> operator, as they are created on the
    fly. If you are accustomed to using nested subroutines in other programming
    languages with their own private variables, you'll have to work at it a bit
    in Perl. The intuitive coding of this type of thing incurs mysterious
    warnings about &quot;will not stay shared&quot; due to the reasons explained
    above. For example, this won't work:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    sub outer {
        my $x = $_[0] + 35;
        sub inner { return $x * 19 }   # WRONG
        return $x + inner();
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A work-around is the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    sub outer {
        my $x = $_[0] + 35;
        local *inner = sub { return $x * 19 };
        return $x + inner();
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now <b>inner()</b> can only be called from within <b>outer()</b>,
    because of the temporary assignments of the anonymous subroutine. But when
    it does, it has normal access to the lexical variable
    <span class="Li">$x</span> from the scope of <b>outer()</b> at the time
    outer is invoked.</p>
<p class="Pp">This has the interesting effect of creating a function local to
    another function, something not normally supported in Perl.</p>

  Dereference Syntax</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Beginning in v5.20.0, a postfix syntax for using references is
    available. It behaves as described in &quot;Using References&quot;, but
    instead of a prefixed sigil, a postfixed sigil-and-star is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $r = \@a;
    @b = $r-&gt;@*; # equivalent to @$r or @{ $r }
    $r = [ 1, [ 2, 3 ], 4 ];
    $r-&gt;[1]-&gt;@*;  # equivalent to @{ $r-&gt;[1] }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In Perl 5.20 and 5.22, this syntax must be enabled with
    <span class="Li">&quot;use feature</span>
    <span class="Li">'postderef'&quot;</span>. As of Perl 5.24, no feature
    declarations are required to make it available.</p>
<p class="Pp">Postfix dereference should work in all circumstances where block
    (circumfix) dereference worked, and should be entirely equivalent. This
    syntax allows dereferencing to be written and read entirely left-to-right.
    The following equivalencies are defined:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $sref-&gt;$*;  # same as  ${ $sref }
  $aref-&gt;@*;  # same as  @{ $aref }
  $aref-&gt;$#*; # same as $#{ $aref }
  $href-&gt;%*;  # same as  %{ $href }
  $cref-&gt;&amp;*;  # same as  &amp;{ $cref }
  $gref-&gt;**;  # same as  *{ $gref }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note especially that
    <span class="Li">&quot;$cref-&gt;&amp;*&quot;</span> is <i>not</i>
    equivalent to <span class="Li">&quot;$cref-&gt;()&quot;</span>, and can
    serve different purposes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Glob elements can be extracted through the postfix dereferencing
    feature:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  $gref-&gt;*{SCALAR}; # same as *{ $gref }{SCALAR}
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Postfix array and scalar dereferencing <i>can</i> be used in
    interpolating strings (double quotes or the
    <span class="Li">&quot;qq&quot;</span> operator), but only if the
    <span class="Li">&quot;postderef_qq&quot;</span> feature is enabled.</p>
