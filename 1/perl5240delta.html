<p class="Pp">Using the <span class="Li">&quot;postderef&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;postderef_qq&quot;</span> features no longer emits a
    warning. Existing code that disables the

    that they previously used will continue to work. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;postderef&quot;</span> feature has no effect; all
    Perl code can use postfix dereferencing, regardless of what feature
    declarations are in scope. The <span class="Li">5.24</span> feature bundle

<p class="Pp">Until now, failure to close the output file for an in-place edit

  &quot;\b{lb}&quot; boundary in regular expressions</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;lb&quot;</span> stands for Line Break. It
    is a Unicode property that determines where a line of text is suitable to
    break (typically so that it can be output without overflowing the available
    horizontal space). This capability has long been furnished by the
    Unicode::LineBreak module, but now a light-weight, non-customizable version
    that is suitable for many purposes is in core Perl.</p>

<p class="Pp">Extended Bracketed Character Classes now will successfully compile
    when <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;locale&quot;</span> is in effect. The
    compiled pattern will use standard Unicode rules. If the runtime locale is
    not a UTF-8 one, a warning is raised and standard Unicode rules are used
    anyway. No tainting is done since the outcome does not actually depend on
    the locale.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Integer_shift_(_____and_____)_now_more_explicitly_defined"><a class="permalink" href="#Integer_shift_(_____and_____)_now_more_explicitly_defined">Integer
  shift (&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;) now more explicitly
  defined</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Negative shifts are reverse shifts: left shift becomes right
    shift, and right shift becomes left shift.</p>
<p class="Pp">Shifting by the number of bits in a native integer (or more) is
    zero, except when the &quot;overshift&quot; is right shifting a negative
    value under <span class="Li">&quot;use integer&quot;</span>, in which case
    the result is -1 (arithmetic shift).</p>
<p class="Pp">Until now negative shifting and overshifting have been undefined
    because they have relied on whatever the C implementation happens to do. For
    example, for the overshift a common C behavior is &quot;modulo
  shift&quot;:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  1 &gt;&gt; 64 == 1 &gt;&gt; (64 % 64) == 1 &gt;&gt; 0 == 1  # Common C behavior.

  # And the same for &lt;&lt;, while Perl now produces 0 for both.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now these behaviors are well-defined under Perl, regardless of
    what the underlying C implementation does. Note, however, that you are still
    constrained by the native integer width: you need to know how far left you
    can go. You can use for example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  use Config;
  my $wordbits = $Config{uvsize} * 8;  # Or $Config{uvsize} &lt;&lt; 3.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you need a more bits on the left shift, you can use for example
    the <span class="Li">&quot;bigint&quot;</span> pragma, or the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Bit::Vector&quot;</span> module from CPAN.</p>

    extends the existing reordering mechanism (which allows reordering for

    a hashbang path unless the path contains &quot;perl&quot; (see perlrun). To
    improve compatibility with Perl 6 this behavior has been extended to also
    redirect if &quot;perl&quot; is followed by &quot;6&quot;.</p>

<p class="Pp">In 5.22 perl started setting umask to 0600 before calling
    <span class="Li">mkstemp(3)</span> and restoring it afterwards. This
    wrongfully tells <span class="Li">open(2)</span> to strip the owner read and

    negation of leaving only those bits in place.</p>
<p class="Pp">Systems that use mode 0666 in <span class="Li">mkstemp(3)</span>
    (like old versions of glibc) create a file with permissions 0066, leaving

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;my $_&quot;</span> was introduced in Perl
    5.10, and subsequently caused much confusion with no obvious solution. In
    Perl 5.18.0, it was made experimental on the theory that it would either be

<p class="Pp">Almost all Unicode properties using the
    <span class="Li">&quot;\p{}&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\P{}&quot;</span> regular expression pattern
    constructs are now checked for validity at pattern compilation time, and
    invalid ones will cause the program to not compile. In earlier releases,
    this check was often deferred until run time. Whenever an error check is
    moved from run- to compile time, erroneous code is caught 100% of the time,
    whereas before it would only get caught if and when the offending portion
    actually gets executed, which for unreachable code might be never.</p>

<p class="Pp">This regular expression character class was deprecated in v5.20.0
    and has produced a deprecation warning since v5.22.0. It is now a
    compile-time error. If you need to examine the individual bytes that make up
    a UTF8-encoded character, then use

<h2 class="Ss">ASCII characters in variable names must now be all visible</h2>
<p class="Pp">It was legal until now on ASCII platforms for variable names to
    contain non-graphical ASCII control characters (ordinals 0 through 31, and
    127, which are the C0 controls and
    <span class="Li">&quot;DELETE&quot;</span>). This usage has been deprecated
    since v5.20, and as of now causes a syntax error. The variables these names
    referred to are special, reserved by Perl for whatever use it may choose,
    now, or in the future. Each such variable has an alternative way of spelling
    it. Instead of the single non-graphic control character, a two character
    sequence beginning with a caret is used, like <span class="Li">$^]</span>
    and <span class="Li">&quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot;</span>. Details are at
    perlvar. It remains legal, though unwise and deprecated (raising a
    deprecation warning), to use certain non-graphic non-ASCII characters in
    variables names when not under
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;utf8&quot;</span>. No code should do this,
    as all such variables are reserved by Perl, and Perl doesn't currently
    define any of them (but could at any time, without notice).</p>

<p class="Pp">Unicode defines code points in the range
    <span class="Li">&quot;0..0x10FFFF&quot;</span>. Some standards at one time
    defined them up to 2**31 - 1, but Perl has allowed them to be as high as

    those above the platform's <span class="Li">&quot;IV_MAX&quot;</span> is
    broken in some constructs, notably
    <span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span>, regular expression patterns
    involving quantifiers, and in some arithmetic and comparison operations,
    such as being the upper limit of a loop. Now the use of such code points
    raises a deprecation warning, unless that warning category is turned off.
    <span class="Li">&quot;IV_MAX&quot;</span> is typically 2**31 -1 on 32-bit

<p class="Pp">Both <span class="Li">&quot;sysread()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;recv()&quot;</span> currently use only the
    <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> flag for the stream, ignoring the
    actual layers. Since <span class="Li">&quot;sysread()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;recv()&quot;</span> do no UTF-8 validation they can
    end up creating invalidly encoded scalars.</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, <span class="Li">&quot;syswrite()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;send()&quot;</span> use only the
    <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> flag, otherwise ignoring any
    layers. If the flag is set, both write the value UTF-8 encoded, even if the
    layer is some different encoding, such as the example above.</p>
<p class="Pp">Ideally, all of these operators would completely ignore the
    <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> state, working only with bytes,
    but this would result in silently breaking existing code. To avoid this a

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;/fixed-substr/&quot;</span> has been made much
      faster.
    <p class="Pp">On platforms with a libc
        <span class="Li">&quot;memchr()&quot;</span> implementation which makes
        good use of underlying hardware support, patterns which include fixed
        substrings will now often be much faster; for example with glibc on a
        recent x86_64 CPU, this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    $s = &quot;a&quot; x 1000 . &quot;wxyz&quot;;
    $s =~ /wxyz/ for 1..30000
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is now about 7 times faster. On systems with slow
        <span class="Li">&quot;memchr()&quot;</span>, e.g. 32-bit ARM Raspberry
        Pi, there will be a small or little speedup. Conversely, some
        pathological cases, such as <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;ab&quot; x 1000
        =~ /aa/&quot;</span> will be slower now; up to 3 times slower on the
        rPi, 1.5x slower on x86_64.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Faster addition, subtraction and multiplication.
    <p class="Pp">Since 5.8.0, arithmetic became slower due to the need to
        support 64-bit integers. To deal with 64-bit integers, a lot more corner
        cases need to be checked, which adds time. We now detect common cases
        where there is no need to check for those corner cases, and special-case
        them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Preincrement, predecrement, postincrement, and postdecrement have been
      made faster by internally splitting the functions which handled multiple
      cases into different functions.</li>
  <li>Creating Perl debugger data structures (see &quot;Debugger Internals&quot;
      in perldebguts) for XSUBs and const subs has been removed. This removed
      one glob/scalar combo for each unique
      <span class="Li">&quot;.c&quot;</span> file that XSUBs and const subs came
      from. On startup (<span class="Li">&quot;perl
      -e&quot;0&quot;&quot;</span>) about half a dozen glob/scalar debugger
      combos were created. Loading XS modules created more glob/scalar combos.
      These things were being created regardless of whether the perl debugger
      was being used, and despite the fact that it can't debug C code
    anyway</li>
  <li>On Win32, <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span>ing or
      <span class="Li">&quot;-X&quot;</span>ing a path, if the file or directory
      does not exist, is now 3.5x faster than before.</li>
  <li>Single arguments in list assign are now slightly faster:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  ($x) = (...);
  (...) = ($x);
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Less peak memory is now used when compiling regular expression
    patterns.</li>

  <dd>UTF-EBCDIC is like UTF-8, but for EBCDIC platforms. It now has been
      extended so that it can represent code points up to 2 ** 64 - 1 on
      platforms with 64-bit words. This brings it into parity with UTF-8. This
      enhancement requires an incompatible change to the representation of code
      points in the range 2 ** 30 to 2 ** 31 -1 (the latter was the previous
      maximum representable code point). This means that a file that contains
      one of these code points, written out with previous versions of perl
      cannot be read in, without conversion, by a perl containing this change.
      We do not believe any such files are in existence, but if you do have one,
      submit a ticket at perlbug@perl.org &lt;mailto:perlbug@perl.org&gt;, and

      capture the current OS X version and specify that as the explicit build
      target in both compiler and linker flags, thus preserving binary
      compatibility for extensions built later regardless of changes in OS X,
      SDK, or compiler and linker versions. To override the default value used

  <li>Perl now implements its own <span class="Li">&quot;killpg&quot;</span> by

      exactly the same thing as a Unix process group, but allows us to send a
      signal to a parent (or master) process and all of its sub-processes. At
      the perl level, this means we can now send a negative pid like so:
    <p class="Pp"></p>

  <li>For those <span class="Li">%ENV</span> elements based on the CRTL environ

  <li>A new build option <span class="Li">&quot;USE_NO_REGISTRY&quot;</span> has
      been added to the makefiles. This option is off by default, meaning the
      default is to do Windows registry lookups. This option stops Perl from
      looking inside the registry for anything. For what values are looked up in
      the registry see perlwin32. Internally, in C, the name of this option is

      lookup certain values, including <span class="Li">%ENV</span> vars
      starting with <span class="Li">&quot;PERL&quot;</span> has changed.
      Previously, the 2 keys were checked for entries at all times through the
      perl process's life time even if they did not exist. For performance
      reasons, now, if the root key (i.e.
      <span class="Li">&quot;HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Perl&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Perl&quot;</span>) does
      not exist at process start time, it will not be checked again for
      <span class="Li">%ENV</span> override entries for the remainder of the
      perl process's life. This more closely matches Unix behavior in that the
      environment is copied or inherited on startup and changing the variable in
      the parent process or another process or editing <i>.bashrc</i> will not
      change the environmental variable in other existing, running,
    processes.</li>
  <li>One glob fetch was removed for each <span class="Li">&quot;-X&quot;</span>
      or <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span> call whether done from Perl
      code or internally from Perl's C code. The glob being looked up was
      <span class="Li">&quot;${^WIN32_SLOPPY_STAT}&quot;</span> which is a
      special variable. This makes <span class="Li">&quot;-X&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;stat&quot;</span> slightly faster.</li>
  <li>During miniperl's process startup, during the build process, 4 to 8 IO
      calls related to the process starting <i>.pl</i> and the
      <i>buildcustomize.pl</i> file were removed from the code opening and
      executing the first 1 or 2 <i>.pl</i> files.</li>
  <li>Builds using Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 and earlier no longer produce an
      &quot;INTERNAL COMPILER ERROR&quot; message. [perl #126045]</li>
  <li>Visual C++ 2013 builds will now execute on XP and higher. Previously they
      would only execute on Vista and higher.</li>
  <li>You can now build perl with GNU Make and GCC. [perl #123440]</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;truncate($filename, $size)&quot;</span> now works
      for files over 4GB in size. [perl #125347]</li>
  <li>Parallel building has been added to the dmake
      <span class="Li">&quot;makefile.mk&quot;</span> makefile. All Win32
      compilers are supported.</li>
  <li>Building a 64-bit perl with a 64-bit GCC but a 32-bit gmake would result
      in an invalid <span class="Li">$Config{archname}</span> for the resulting
      perl. [perl #127584]</li>
  <li>Errors set by Winsock functions are now put directly into
      <span class="Li">$^E</span>, and the relevant
      <span class="Li">&quot;WSAE*&quot;</span> error codes are now exported
      from the Errno and POSIX modules for testing this against.
    <p class="Pp">The previous behavior of putting the errors (converted to
        POSIX-style <span class="Li">&quot;E*&quot;</span> error codes since
        Perl 5.20.0) into <span class="Li">$!</span> was buggy due to the
        non-equivalence of like-named Winsock and POSIX error constants, a
        relationship between which has unfortunately been established in one way
        or another since Perl 5.8.0.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The new behavior provides a much more robust solution for
        checking Winsock errors in portable software without accidentally
        matching POSIX tests that were intended for other OSes and may have
        different meanings for Winsock.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The old behavior is currently retained, warts and all, for
        backwards compatibility, but users are encouraged to change any code
        that tests <span class="Li">$!</span> against
        <span class="Li">&quot;E*&quot;</span> constants for Winsock errors to
        instead test <span class="Li">$^E</span> against
        <span class="Li">&quot;WSAE*&quot;</span> constants. After a suitable
        deprecation period, the old behavior may be removed, leaving

      details may need to be fixed. The main changes are:</dd>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;PUSHBLOCK()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;POPSUB()&quot;</span> etc. macros have been
      replaced with static inline functions such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;cx_pushblock()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;cx_popsub()&quot;</span> etc. These use function
      args rather than implicitly relying on local vars such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;gimme&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;newsp&quot;</span> being available. Also their
      functionality has changed: in particular,
      <span class="Li">&quot;cx_popblock()&quot;</span> no longer decrements
      <span class="Li">&quot;cxstack_ix&quot;</span>. The ordering of the steps
      in the <span class="Li">&quot;pp_leave*&quot;</span> functions involving
      <span class="Li">&quot;cx_popblock()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;cx_popsub()&quot;</span> etc. has changed. See the
      new documentation, &quot;Dynamic Scope and the Context Stack&quot; in
      perlguts, for details on how to use them.</li>
  <li>Various macros, which now consistently have a CX_ prefix, have been added:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  CX_CUR(), CX_LEAVE_SCOPE(), CX_POP()
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or renamed:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>

  CX_POP_SAVEARRAY(), CX_DEBUG(), CX_PUSHSUBST(), CX_POPSUBST()

  <li><span class="Li">&quot;cx_pushblock()&quot;</span> now saves
      <span class="Li">&quot;PL_savestack_ix&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;PL_tmps_floor&quot;</span>, so
      <span class="Li">&quot;pp_enter*&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;pp_leave*&quot;</span> no longer do
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  ENTER; SAVETMPS; ....; LEAVE
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;cx_popblock()&quot;</span> now also restores
      <span class="Li">&quot;PL_curpm&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>In <span class="Li">&quot;dounwind()&quot;</span> for every context type,
      the current savestack frame is now processed before each context is
      popped; formerly this was only done for sub-like context frames. This
      action has been removed from
      <span class="Li">&quot;cx_popsub()&quot;</span> and placed into its own
      macro, <span class="Li">&quot;CX_LEAVE_SCOPE(cx)&quot;</span>, which must
      be called before <span class="Li">&quot;cx_popsub()&quot;</span> etc.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;dounwind()&quot;</span> now also does a
        <span class="Li">&quot;cx_popblock()&quot;</span> on the last popped
        frame (formerly it only did the
        <span class="Li">&quot;cx_popsub()&quot;</span> etc. actions on each
        frame).</p>
  </li>
  <li>The temps stack is now freed on scope exit; previously, temps created
      during the last statement of a block wouldn't be freed until the next
      <span class="Li">&quot;nextstate&quot;</span> following the block (apart
      from an existing hack that did this for recursive subs in scalar context);
      and in something like <span class="Li">&quot;f(g())&quot;</span>, the
      temps created by the last statement in
      <span class="Li">&quot;g()&quot;</span> would formerly not be freed until
      the statement following the return from
      <span class="Li">&quot;f()&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>Most values that were saved on the savestack on scope entry are now saved
      in suitable new fields in the context struct, and saved and restored
      directly by <span class="Li">&quot;cx_pushfoo()&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;cx_popfoo()&quot;</span>, which is much
    faster.</li>
  <li>Various context struct fields have been added, removed or modified.</li>
  <li>The handling of <span class="Li">@_</span> in
      <span class="Li">&quot;cx_pushsub()&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;cx_popsub()&quot;</span> has been considerably
      tidied up, including removing the
      <span class="Li">&quot;argarray&quot;</span> field from the context
      struct, and extracting out some common (but rarely used) code into a
      separate function, <span class="Li">&quot;clear_defarray()&quot;</span>.
      Also, useful subsets of <span class="Li">&quot;cx_popsub()&quot;</span>
      which had been unrolled in places like
      <span class="Li">&quot;pp_goto&quot;</span> have been gathered into the
      new functions <span class="Li">&quot;cx_popsub_args()&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;cx_popsub_common()&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;pp_leavesub&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;pp_leavesublv&quot;</span> now use the same
      function as the rest of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;pp_leave*&quot;</span>'s to process return
    args.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;CXp_FOR_PAD&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;CXp_FOR_GV&quot;</span> flags have been added, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;CXt_LOOP_FOR&quot;</span> has been split into

  <li>Some variables formerly declared by
      <span class="Li">&quot;dMULTICALL&quot;</span> (but not documented) have
      been removed.</li>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The obscure <span class="Li">&quot;PL_timesbuf&quot;</span> variable,
      effectively a vestige of Perl 1, has been removed. It was documented as
      deprecated in Perl 5.20, with a statement that it would be removed early
      in the 5.21.x series; that has now finally happened. [perl #121351]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=121351&gt;</li>
  <li>An unwarranted assertion in
      <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_newATTRSUB_x()&quot;</span> has been removed.
      If a stub subroutine definition with a prototype has been seen, then any
      subsequent stub (or definition) of the same subroutine with an attribute
      was causing an assertion failure because of a null pointer. [perl #126845]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126845&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span> has been replaced by
      <span class="Li">&quot;__&quot;</span> in
      <span class="Li">&quot;ExtUtils::ParseXS&quot;</span>, like it's done for
      parameters/return values. This is more consistent, and simplifies writing
      XS code wrapping C++ classes into a nested Perl namespace (it requires
      only a typedef for <span class="Li">&quot;Foo__Bar&quot;</span> rather
      than two, one for <span class="Li">&quot;Foo_Bar&quot;</span> and the
      other for <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::Bar&quot;</span>).</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;to_utf8_case()&quot;</span> function is now
      deprecated. Instead use <span class="Li">&quot;toUPPER_utf8&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;toTITLE_utf8&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;toLOWER_utf8&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;toFOLD_utf8&quot;</span>. (See
      &lt;http://nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/233287&gt;.)</li>
  <li>Perl core code and the threads extension have been annotated so that, if
      Perl is configured to use threads, then during compile-time clang (3.6 or
      later) will warn about suspicious uses of mutexes. See
      &lt;http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html&gt; for more
      information.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;signbit()&quot;</span> emulation has been
      enhanced. This will help older and/or more exotic platforms or
      configurations.</li>
  <li>Most EBCDIC-specific code in the core has been unified with non-EBCDIC
      code, to avoid repetition and make maintenance easier.</li>
  <li>MSWin32 code for <span class="Li">$^X</span> has been moved out of the
      <i>win32</i> directory to <i>caretx.c</i>, where other operating systems
      set that variable.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;sv_ref()&quot;</span> is now part of the API.</li>
  <li>&quot;sv_backoff&quot; in perlapi had its return type changed from
      <span class="Li">&quot;int&quot;</span> to
      <span class="Li">&quot;void&quot;</span>. It previously has always
      returned <span class="Li">0</span> since Perl 5.000 stable but that was
      undocumented. Although <span class="Li">&quot;sv_backoff&quot;</span> is
      marked as public API, XS code is not expected to be impacted since the
      proper API call would be through public API
      <span class="Li">&quot;sv_setsv(sv, &amp;PL_sv_undef)&quot;</span>, or
      quasi-public <span class="Li">&quot;SvOOK_off&quot;</span>, or non-public
      <span class="Li">&quot;SvOK_off&quot;</span> calls, and the return value
      of <span class="Li">&quot;sv_backoff&quot;</span> was previously a
      meaningless constant that can be rewritten as
      <span class="Li">&quot;(sv_backoff(sv),0)&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;EXTEND&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;MEXTEND&quot;</span> macros have been improved to
      avoid various issues with integer truncation and wrapping. In particular,
      some casts formerly used within the macros have been removed. This means
      for example that passing an unsigned
      <span class="Li">&quot;nitems&quot;</span> argument is likely to raise a
      compiler warning now (it's always been documented to require a signed
      value; formerly int, lately SSize_t).</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;PL_sawalias&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;GPf_ALIASED_SV&quot;</span> have been removed.</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;GvASSIGN_GENERATION&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;GvASSIGN_GENERATION_set&quot;</span> have been
      removed.</li>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>It now works properly to specify a user-defined property, such as
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
 qr/\p{mypkg1::IsMyProperty}/i
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">with <span class="Li">&quot;/i&quot;</span> caseless matching,
        an explicit package name, and <i>IsMyProperty</i> not defined at the
        time of the pattern compilation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Perl's <span class="Li">&quot;memcpy()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;memmove()&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;memset()&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;memcmp()&quot;</span> fallbacks are now more
      compatible with the originals. [perl #127619]</li>
  <li>Fixed the issue where a <span class="Li">&quot;s///r&quot;</span>) with
      <b>-DPERL_NO_COW</b> attempts to modify the source SV, resulting in the
      program dying. [perl #127635]</li>
  <li>Fixed an EBCDIC-platform-only case where a pattern could fail to match.
      This occurred when matching characters from the set of C1 controls when
      the target matched string was in UTF-8.</li>
  <li>Narrow the filename check in <i>strict.pm</i> and <i>warnings.pm</i>.
      Previously, it assumed that if the filename (without the <i>.pmc?</i>
      extension) differed from the package name, if was a misspelled use
      statement (i.e. <span class="Li">&quot;use Strict&quot;</span> instead of
      <span class="Li">&quot;use strict&quot;</span>). We now check whether
      there's really a miscapitalization happening, and not some other
    issue.</li>
  <li>Turn an assertion into a more user friendly failure when parsing regexes.
      [perl #127599]</li>
  <li>Correctly raise an error when trying to compile patterns with unterminated
      character classes while there are trailing backslashes. [perl
    #126141].</li>
  <li>Line numbers larger than 2**31-1 but less than 2**32 are no longer
      returned by <span class="Li">&quot;caller()&quot;</span> as negative
      numbers. [perl #126991]</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;unless ( </span><i>assignment</i><span class="Li">
      )&quot;</span> now properly warns when syntax warnings are enabled. [perl
      #127122]</li>
  <li>Setting an <span class="Li">&quot;ISA&quot;</span> glob to an array
      reference now properly adds <span class="Li">&quot;isaelem&quot;</span>
      magic to any existing elements. Previously modifying such an element would
      not update the ISA cache, so method calls would call the wrong function.
      Perl would also crash if the <span class="Li">&quot;ISA&quot;</span> glob
      was destroyed, since new code added in 5.23.7 would try to release the
      <span class="Li">&quot;isaelem&quot;</span> magic from the elements. [perl
      #127351]</li>
  <li>If a here-doc was found while parsing another operator, the parser had
      already read end of file, and the here-doc was not terminated, perl could
      produce an assertion or a segmentation fault. This now reliably complains
      about the unterminated here-doc. [perl #125540]</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;untie()&quot;</span> would sometimes return the
      last value returned by the <span class="Li">&quot;UNTIE()&quot;</span>
      handler as well as it's normal value, messing up the stack. [perl
    #126621]</li>
  <li>Fixed an operator precedence problem when <span class="Li">&quot;
      castflags &amp; 2&quot;</span> is true. [perl #127474]</li>
  <li>Caching of DESTROY methods could result in a non-pointer or a non-STASH
      stored in the <span class="Li">&quot;SvSTASH()&quot;</span> slot of a
      stash, breaking the B <span class="Li">&quot;STASH()&quot;</span> method.
      The DESTROY method is now cached in the MRO metadata for the stash. [perl
      #126410]</li>
  <li>The AUTOLOAD method is now called when searching for a DESTROY method, and
      correctly sets <span class="Li">$AUTOLOAD</span> too. [perl #124387] [perl
      #127494]</li>
  <li>Avoid parsing beyond the end of the buffer when processing a
      <span class="Li">&quot;#line&quot;</span> directive with no filename.
      [perl #127334]</li>
  <li>Perl now raises a warning when a regular expression pattern looks like it
      was supposed to contain a POSIX class, like
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr/[[:alpha:]]/&quot;</span>, but there was some
      slight defect in its specification which causes it to instead be treated
      as a regular bracketed character class. An example would be missing the
      second colon in the above like this:
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr/[[:alpha]]/&quot;</span>. This compiles to match
      a sequence of two characters. The second is
      <span class="Li">&quot;]&quot;</span>, and the first is any of:
      <span class="Li">&quot;[&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;:&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;a&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;h&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;l&quot;</span>, or
      <span class="Li">&quot;p&quot;</span>. This is unlikely to be the intended
      meaning, and now a warning is raised. No warning is raised unless the
      specification is very close to one of the 14 legal POSIX classes. (See
      &quot;POSIX Character Classes&quot; in perlrecharclass.) [perl #8904]</li>
  <li>Certain regex patterns involving a complemented POSIX class in an inverted
      bracketed character class, and matching something else optionally would
      improperly fail to match. An example of one that could fail is
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr/_?[^\Wbar]\x{100}/&quot;</span>. This has been
      fixed. [perl #127537]</li>
  <li>Perl 5.22 added support to the C99 hexadecimal floating point notation,
      but sometimes misparses hex floats. This has been fixed. [perl
    #127183]</li>
  <li>A regression that allowed undeclared barewords in hash keys to work
      despite strictures has been fixed. [perl #126981]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126981&gt;</li>
  <li>Calls to the placeholder <span class="Li">&amp;PL_sv_yes</span> used
      internally when an <span class="Li">&quot;import()&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;unimport()&quot;</span> method isn't found now
      correctly handle scalar context. [perl #126042]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126042&gt;</li>
  <li>Report more context when we see an array where we expect to see an
      operator and avoid an assertion failure. [perl #123737]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123737&gt;</li>
  <li>Modifying an array that was previously a package
      <span class="Li">@ISA</span> no longer causes assertion failures or
      crashes. [perl #123788]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=123788&gt;</li>
  <li>Retain binary compatibility across plain and DEBUGGING perl builds. [perl
      #127212] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=127212&gt;</li>
  <li>Avoid leaking memory when setting <span class="Li">$ENV{foo}</span> on
      darwin. [perl #126240]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126240&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;/...\G/&quot;</span> no longer crashes on utf8
      strings. When <span class="Li">&quot;\G&quot;</span> is a fixed number of
      characters from the start of the regex, perl needs to count back that many
      characters from the current <span class="Li">&quot;pos()&quot;</span>
      position and start matching from there. However, it was counting back
      bytes rather than characters, which could lead to panics on utf8
    strings.</li>
  <li>In some cases operators that return integers would return negative
      integers as large positive integers. [perl #126635]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126635&gt;</li>
  <li>The <span class="Li">&quot;pipe()&quot;</span> operator would assert for
      DEBUGGING builds instead of producing the correct error message. The
      condition asserted on is detected and reported on correctly without the
      assertions, so the assertions were removed. [perl #126480]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126480&gt;</li>
  <li>In some cases, failing to parse a here-doc would attempt to use freed
      memory. This was caused by a pointer not being restored correctly. [perl
      #126443] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126443&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;@x = sort { *a = 0; $a &lt;=&gt; $b } 0 ..
      1&quot;</span> no longer frees the GP for *a before restoring its SV slot.
      [perl #124097]
    &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=124097&gt;</li>
  <li>Multiple problems with the new hexadecimal floating point printf format
      <span class="Li">%a</span> were fixed: [perl #126582]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126582&gt;, [perl #126586]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126586&gt;, [perl #126822]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126822&gt;</li>
  <li>Calling <span class="Li">&quot;mg_set()&quot;</span> in
      <span class="Li">&quot;leave_scope()&quot;</span> no longer leaks.</li>
  <li>A regression from Perl v5.20 was fixed in which debugging output of
      regular expression compilation was wrong. (The pattern was correctly
      compiled, but what got displayed for it was wrong.)</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;\b{sb}&quot;</span> works much better. In Perl
      v5.22.0, this new construct didn't seem to give the expected results, yet
      passed all the tests in the extensive suite furnished by Unicode. It turns
      out that it was because these were short input strings, and the failures
      had to do with longer inputs.</li>
  <li>Certain syntax errors in &quot;Extended Bracketed Character Classes&quot;
      in perlrecharclass caused panics instead of the proper error message. This
      has now been fixed. [perl #126481]</li>
  <li>Perl 5.20 added a message when a quantifier in a regular expression was
      useless, but then caused the parser to skip it; this caused the surplus
      quantifier to be silently ignored, instead of throwing an error. This is
      now fixed. [perl #126253]</li>
  <li>The switch to building non-XS modules last in win32/makefile.mk
      (introduced by design as part of the changes to enable parallel building)
      caused the build of POSIX to break due to problems with the version
      module. This is now fixed.</li>
  <li>Improved parsing of hex float constants.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue with <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span> where
      <span class="Li">&quot;pack &quot;H&quot;&quot;</span> (and
      <span class="Li">&quot;pack &quot;h&quot;&quot;</span>) could read past
      the source when given a non-utf8 source, and a utf8 target. [perl
    #126325]</li>
  <li>Fixed several cases where perl would abort due to a segmentation fault, or
      a C-level assert. [perl #126615], [perl #126602], [perl #126193].</li>
  <li>There were places in regular expression patterns where comments
      (<span class="Li">&quot;(?#...)&quot;</span>) weren't allowed, but should
      have been. This is now fixed. [perl #116639]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=116639&gt;</li>
  <li>Some regressions from Perl 5.20 have been fixed, in which some syntax
      errors in <span class="Li">&quot;(?[...])&quot;</span> constructs within
      regular expression patterns could cause a segfault instead of a proper
      error message. [perl #126180]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126180&gt; [perl #126404]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126404&gt;</li>
  <li>Another problem with <span class="Li">&quot;(?[...])&quot;</span>
      constructs has been fixed wherein things like
      <span class="Li">&quot;\c]&quot;</span> could cause panics. [perl #126181]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126181&gt;</li>
  <li>Some problems with attempting to extend the perl stack to around 2G or 4G
      entries have been fixed. This was particularly an issue on 32-bit perls
      built to use 64-bit integers, and was easily noticeable with the list
      repetition operator, e.g.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    @a = (1) x $big_number
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Formerly perl may have crashed, depending on the exact value
        of <span class="Li">$big_number</span>; now it will typically raise an
        exception. [perl #125937]
        &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125937&gt;</p>
  </li>
  <li>In a regex conditional expression
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?(condition)yes-pattern|no-pattern)&quot;</span>,
      if the condition is <span class="Li">&quot;(?!)&quot;</span> then perl
      failed the match outright instead of matching the no-pattern. This has
      been fixed. [perl #126222]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126222&gt;</li>
  <li>The special backtracking control verbs
      <span class="Li">&quot;(*VERB:ARG)&quot;</span> now all allow an optional
      argument and set
      <span class="Li">&quot;REGERROR&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;REGMARK&quot;</span>
      appropriately as well. [perl #126186]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126186&gt;</li>
  <li>Several bugs, including a segmentation fault, have been fixed with the
      boundary checking constructs (introduced in Perl 5.22)
      <span class="Li">&quot;\b{gcb}&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\b{sb}&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\b{wb}&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\B{gcb}&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\B{sb}&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;\B{wb}&quot;</span>. All the
      <span class="Li">&quot;\B{}&quot;</span> ones now match an empty string;
      none of the <span class="Li">&quot;\b{}&quot;</span> ones do. [perl
      #126319] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=126319&gt;</li>
  <li>Duplicating a closed file handle for write no longer creates a filename of
      the form <i>GLOB(0xXXXXXXXX)</i>. [perl #125115]</li>
  <li>Warning fatality is now ignored when rewinding the stack. This prevents
      infinite recursion when the now fatal error also causes rewinding of the
      stack. [perl #123398]</li>
  <li>In perl v5.22.0, the logic changed when parsing a numeric parameter to the
      -C option, such that the successfully parsed number was not saved as the
      option value if it parsed to the end of the argument. [perl #125381]</li>
  <li>The PadlistNAMES macro is an lvalue again.</li>
  <li>Zero -DPERL_TRACE_OPS memory for sub-threads.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;perl_clone_using()&quot;</span> was
        missing Zero init of PL_op_exec_cnt[]. This caused sub-threads in
        threaded -DPERL_TRACE_OPS builds to spew exceedingly large op-counts at
        destruct. These counts would print <span class="Li">%x</span> as
        &quot;ABABABAB&quot;, clearly a mem-poison value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>A leak in the XS typemap caused one scalar to be leaked each time a
      <span class="Li">&quot;FILE *&quot;</span> or a
      <span class="Li">&quot;PerlIO *&quot;</span> was
      <span class="Li">&quot;OUTPUT:&quot;</span>ed or imported to Perl, since
      perl 5.000. These particular typemap entries are thought to be extremely
      rarely used by XS modules. [perl #124181]</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;alarm()&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;sleep()&quot;</span> will now warn if the argument
      is a negative number and return undef. Previously they would pass the
      negative value to the underlying C function which may have set up a timer
      with a surprising value.</li>
  <li>Perl can again be compiled with any Unicode version. This used to (mostly)
      work, but was lost in v5.18 through v5.20. The property
      <span class="Li">&quot;Name_Alias&quot;</span> did not exist prior to
      Unicode 5.0. Unicode::UCD incorrectly said it did. This has been
    fixed.</li>
  <li>Very large code-points (beyond Unicode) in regular expressions no longer
      cause a buffer overflow in some cases when converted to UTF-8. [perl
      #125826] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125826&gt;</li>
  <li>The integer overflow check for the range operator (...) in list context
      now correctly handles the case where the size of the range is larger than
      the address space. This could happen on 32-bits with -Duse64bitint. [perl
      #125781] &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125781&gt;</li>
  <li>A crash with <span class="Li">&quot;%::=();
      J-&gt;${\&quot;::&quot;}&quot;</span> has been fixed. [perl #125541]
      &lt;https://rt.perl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=125541&gt;</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;qr/(?[ () ])/&quot;</span> no longer segfaults,
      giving a syntax error message instead. [perl #125805]</li>
  <li>Regular expression possessive quantifier v5.20 regression now fixed.
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr/&quot;</span><i>PAT</i><span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span><i>min</i>,<i>max</i><span class="Li">&quot;}+&quot;</span><span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span>
      is supposed to behave identically to
      <span class="Li">&quot;qr/(?&gt;&quot;</span><i>PAT</i><span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span><i>min</i>,<i>max</i><span class="Li">&quot;})/&quot;</span>.
      Since v5.20, this didn't work if <i>min</i> and <i>max</i> were equal.
      [perl #125825]</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN &lt;&gt;&quot;</span> no longer segfaults and
      properly produces an error message. [perl #125341]</li>
  <li>In <span class="Li">&quot;tr///&quot;</span> an illegal backwards range
      like <span class="Li">&quot;tr/\x{101}-\x{100}//&quot;</span> was not
      always detected, giving incorrect results. This is now fixed.</li>
