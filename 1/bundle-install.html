<p class="Pp">Install the gems specified in your Gemfile(5). If this is the

    install all needed gems.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a <b>Gemfile.lock</b> does exist, and you have not updated your
    Gemfile(5), Bundler will fetch all remote sources, but use the dependencies
    specified in the <b>Gemfile.lock</b> instead of resolving dependencies.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a <b>Gemfile.lock</b> does exist, and you have updated your
    Gemfile(5), Bundler will use the dependencies in the <b>Gemfile.lock</b> for
    all gems that you did not update, but will re-resolve the dependencies of
    gems that you did update. You can find more information about this update
    process below under <i>CONSERVATIVE UPDATING</i>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SUDO_USAGE"><a class="permalink" href="#SUDO_USAGE">SUDO
  USAGE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">By default, Bundler installs gems to the same location as <b>gem
    install</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In some cases, that location may not be writable by your Unix
    user. In that case, Bundler will stage everything in a temporary directory,
    then ask you for your <b>sudo</b> password in order to copy the gems into
    their system location.</p>
<p class="Pp">From your perspective, this is identical to installing the gems
    directly into the system.</p>
<p class="Pp">You should never use <b>sudo bundle install</b>. This is because
    several other steps in <b>bundle install</b> must be performed as the
    current user:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Updating your <b>Gemfile.lock</b></li>
  <li>Updating your <b>vendor/cache</b>, if necessary</li>
  <li>Checking out private git repositories using your user&#x00B4;s SSH
    keys</li>
</ul>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Of these three, the first two could theoretically be performed by
    <b>chown</b>ing the resulting files to <b>$SUDO_USER</b>. The third,
    however, can only be performed by invoking the <b>git</b> command as the
    current user. Therefore, git gems are downloaded and installed into
    <b>~/.bundle</b> rather than $GEM_HOME or $BUNDLE_PATH.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a result, you should run <b>bundle install</b> as the current
    user, and Bundler will ask for your password if it is needed to put the gems
    into their final location.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="INSTALLING_GROUPS"><a class="permalink" href="#INSTALLING_GROUPS">INSTALLING
  GROUPS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">By default, <b>bundle install</b> will install all gems in all
    groups in your Gemfile(5), except those declared for a different
  platform.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, you can explicitly tell Bundler to skip installing
    certain groups with the <b>--without</b> option. This option takes a
    space-separated list of groups.</p>
<p class="Pp">While the <b>--without</b> option will skip <i>installing</i> the
    gems in the specified groups, it will still <i>download</i> those gems and
    use them to resolve the dependencies of every gem in your Gemfile(5).</p>
<p class="Pp">This is so that installing a different set of groups on another
    machine (such as a production server) will not change the gems and versions
    that you have already developed and tested against.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Bundler offers a rock-solid guarantee that the third-party code
    you are running in development and testing is also the third-party code you
    are running in production. You can choose to exclude some of that code in
    different environments, but you will never be caught flat-footed by
    different versions of third-party code being used in different
    environments.</b></p>
<p class="Pp">For a simple illustration, consider the following Gemfile(5):</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
source &#x00B4;https://rubygems.org&#x00B4;
gem &#x00B4;sinatra&#x00B4;
group :production do
  gem &#x00B4;rack-perftools-profiler&#x00B4;
end</pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In this case, <b>sinatra</b> depends on any version of Rack
    (<b>&gt;= 1.0</b>), while <b>rack-perftools-profiler</b> depends on 1.x
    (<b>~&gt; 1.0</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">When you run <b>bundle install --without production</b> in
    development, we look at the dependencies of <b>rack-perftools-profiler</b>
    as well. That way, you do not spend all your time developing against Rack
    2.0, using new APIs unavailable in Rack 1.x, only to have Bundler switch to
    Rack 1.2 when the <b>production</b> group <i>is</i> used.</p>
<p class="Pp">This should not cause any problems in practice, because we do not
    attempt to <b>install</b> the gems in the excluded groups, and only evaluate
    as part of the dependency resolution process.</p>
<p class="Pp">This also means that you cannot include different versions of the
    same gem in different groups, because doing so would result in different
    sets of dependencies used in development and production. Because of the
    vagaries of the dependency resolution process, this usually affects more
    than the gems you list in your Gemfile(5), and can (surprisingly) radically
    change the gems you are using.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="THE_GEMFILE"><a class="permalink" href="#THE_GEMFILE">THE
  GEMFILE.LOCK</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When you run <b>bundle install</b>, Bundler will persist the full
    names and versions of all gems that you used (including dependencies of the
    gems specified in the Gemfile(5)) into a file called
  <b>Gemfile.lock</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Bundler uses this file in all subsequent calls to <b>bundle
    install</b>, which guarantees that you always use the same exact code, even
    as your application moves across machines.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because of the way dependency resolution works, even a seemingly
    small change (for instance, an update to a point-release of a dependency of
    a gem in your Gemfile(5)) can result in radically different gems being
    needed to satisfy all dependencies.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a result, you <b>SHOULD</b> check your <b>Gemfile.lock</b> into
    version control, in both applications and gems. If you do not, every machine
    that checks out your repository (including your production server) will
    resolve all dependencies again, which will result in different versions of
    third-party code being used if <b>any</b> of the gems in the Gemfile(5) or
    any of their dependencies have been updated.</p>
<p class="Pp">When Bundler first shipped, the <b>Gemfile.lock</b> was included
    in the <b>.gitignore</b> file included with generated gems. Over time,
    however, it became clear that this practice forces the pain of broken
    dependencies onto new contributors, while leaving existing contributors
    potentially unaware of the problem. Since <b>bundle install</b> is usually
    the first step towards a contribution, the pain of broken dependencies would
    discourage new contributors from contributing. As a result, we have revised
    our guidance for gem authors to now recommend checking in the lock for
  gems.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONSERVATIVE_UPDATING"><a class="permalink" href="#CONSERVATIVE_UPDATING">CONSERVATIVE
  UPDATING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When you make a change to the Gemfile(5) and then run <b>bundle
    install</b>, Bundler will update only the gems that you modified.</p>
<p class="Pp">In other words, if a gem that you <b>did not modify</b> worked
    before you called <b>bundle install</b>, it will continue to use the exact
    same versions of all dependencies as it used before the update.</p>
<p class="Pp">Let&#x00B4;s take a look at an example. Here&#x00B4;s your
    original Gemfile(5):</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
source &#x00B4;https://rubygems.org&#x00B4;
gem &#x00B4;actionpack&#x00B4;, &#x00B4;2.3.8&#x00B4;
gem &#x00B4;activemerchant&#x00B4;</pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In this case, both <b>actionpack</b> and <b>activemerchant</b>
    depend on <b>activesupport</b>. The <b>actionpack</b> gem depends on
    <b>activesupport 2.3.8</b> and <b>rack ~&gt; 1.1.0</b>, while the
    <b>activemerchant</b> gem depends on <b>activesupport &gt;= 2.3.2</b>,
    <b>braintree &gt;= 2.0.0</b>, and <b>builder &gt;= 2.0.0</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the dependencies are first resolved, Bundler will select
    <b>activesupport 2.3.8</b>, which satisfies the requirements of both gems in
    your Gemfile(5).</p>
<p class="Pp">Next, you modify your Gemfile(5) to:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
source &#x00B4;https://rubygems.org&#x00B4;
gem &#x00B4;actionpack&#x00B4;, &#x00B4;3.0.0.rc&#x00B4;
gem &#x00B4;activemerchant&#x00B4;</pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>
  </dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <b>actionpack 3.0.0.rc</b> gem has a number of new
    dependencies, and updates the <b>activesupport</b> dependency to <b>=
    3.0.0.rc</b> and the <b>rack</b> dependency to <b>~&gt; 1.2.1</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you run <b>bundle install</b>, Bundler notices that you
    changed the <b>actionpack</b> gem, but not the <b>activemerchant</b> gem. It
    evaluates the gems currently being used to satisfy its requirements:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="activesupport"><a class="permalink" href="#activesupport"><b>activesupport
    2.3.8</b></a></dt>
  <dd>also used to satisfy a dependency in <b>activemerchant</b>, which is not
      being updated</dd>
  <dt id="rack"><a class="permalink" href="#rack"><b>rack ~&gt;
    1.1.0</b></a></dt>
  <dd>not currently being used to satisfy another dependency</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Because you did not explicitly ask to update
    <b>activemerchant</b>, you would not expect it to suddenly stop working
    after updating <b>actionpack</b>. However, satisfying the new
    <b>activesupport 3.0.0.rc</b> dependency of actionpack requires updating one
    of its dependencies.</p>
<p class="Pp">Even though <b>activemerchant</b> declares a very loose dependency
    that theoretically matches <b>activesupport 3.0.0.rc</b>, Bundler treats
    gems in your Gemfile(5) that have not changed as an atomic unit together
    with their dependencies. In this case, the <b>activemerchant</b> dependency
    is treated as <b>activemerchant 1.7.1 + activesupport 2.3.8</b>, so
    <b>bundle install</b> will report that it cannot update
  <b>actionpack</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">To explicitly update <b>actionpack</b>, including its dependencies
    which other gems in the Gemfile(5) still depend on, run <b>bundle update
    actionpack</b> (see <b>bundle update(1)</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Summary</b>: In general, after making a change to the
    Gemfile(5) , you should first try to run <b>bundle install</b>, which will
    guarantee that no other gem in the Gemfile(5) is impacted by the change. If
    that does not work, run bundle update(1) <i>bundle-update.1.html</i>.</p>
