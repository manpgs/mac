<p class="Pp">This program dumps the given revisions in a form suitable to be
    piped into <i>git fast-import</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can use it as a human-readable bundle replacement (see
    <b>git-bundle</b>(1)), or as a format that can be edited before being fed to
    <i>git fast-import</i> in order to do history rewrites (an ability relied on
    by tools like <i>git filter-repo</i>).</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">--progress=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Insert <i>progress</i> statements every &lt;n&gt;
  objects, to be shown by <i>git fast-import</i> during import.</div>
<p class="Pp">--signed-tags=(verbatim|warn|warn-strip|strip|abort)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify how to handle signed tags. Since any
  transformation after the export can change the tag names (which can also
  happen when excluding revisions) the signatures will not match.
<p class="Pp">When asking to <i>abort</i> (which is the default), this program
    will die when encountering a signed tag. With <i>strip</i>, the tags will
    silently be made unsigned, with <i>warn-strip</i> they will be made unsigned
    but a warning will be displayed, with <i>verbatim</i>, they will be silently
    exported and with <i>warn</i>, they will be exported, but you will see a
    warning.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--tag-of-filtered-object=(abort|drop|rewrite)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify how to handle tags whose tagged object is
  filtered out. Since revisions and files to export can be limited by path,
  tagged objects may be filtered completely.
<p class="Pp">When asking to <i>abort</i> (which is the default), this program
    will die when encountering such a tag. With <i>drop</i> it will omit such
    tags from the output. With <i>rewrite</i>, if the tagged object is a commit,
    it will rewrite the tag to tag an ancestor commit (via parent rewriting; see
    <b>git-rev-list</b>(1))</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-M, -C</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Perform move and/or copy detection, as described in the
  <b>git-diff</b>(1) manual page, and use it to generate rename and copy
  commands in the output dump.
<p class="Pp">Note that earlier versions of this command did not complain and
    produced incorrect results if you gave these options.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--export-marks=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Dumps the internal marks table to &lt;file&gt; when
  complete. Marks are written one per line as <b>:markid SHA-1</b>. Only marks
  for revisions are dumped; marks for blobs are ignored. Backends can use this
  file to validate imports after they have been completed, or to save the marks
  table across incremental runs. As &lt;file&gt; is only opened and truncated at
  completion, the same path can also be safely given to --import-marks. The file
  will not be written if no new object has been marked/exported.</div>
<p class="Pp">--import-marks=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Before processing any input, load the marks specified in
  &lt;file&gt;. The input file must exist, must be readable, and must use the
  same format as produced by --export-marks.</div>
<p class="Pp">--mark-tags</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to labelling blobs and commits with mark ids,
  also label tags. This is useful in conjunction with <b>--export-marks</b> and
  <b>--import-marks</b>, and is also useful (and necessary) for exporting of
  nested tags. It does not hurt other cases and would be the default, but many
  fast-import frontends are not prepared to accept tags with mark identifiers.
<p class="Pp">Any commits (or tags) that have already been marked will not be
    exported again. If the backend uses a similar --import-marks file, this
    allows for incremental bidirectional exporting of the repository by keeping
    the marks the same across runs.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--fake-missing-tagger</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Some old repositories have tags without a tagger. The
  fast-import protocol was pretty strict about that, and did not allow that. So
  fake a tagger to be able to fast-import the output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--use-done-feature</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Start the stream with a <i>feature done</i> stanza, and
  terminate it with a <i>done</i> command.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-data</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Skip output of blob objects and instead refer to blobs
  via their original SHA-1 hash. This is useful when rewriting the directory
  structure or history of a repository without touching the contents of
  individual files. Note that the resulting stream can only be used by a
  repository which already contains the necessary objects.</div>
<p class="Pp">--full-tree</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option will cause fast-export to issue a
  &quot;deleteall&quot; directive for each commit followed by a full list of all
  files in the commit (as opposed to just listing the files which are different
  from the commit&#x2019;s first parent).</div>
<p class="Pp">--anonymize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Anonymize the contents of the repository while still
  retaining the shape of the history and stored tree. See the section on
  <b>ANONYMIZING</b> below.</div>
<p class="Pp">--anonymize-map=&lt;from&gt;[:&lt;to&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Convert token <b>&lt;from&gt;</b> to <b>&lt;to&gt;</b> in
  the anonymized output. If <b>&lt;to&gt;</b> is omitted, map
  <b>&lt;from&gt;</b> to itself (i.e., do not anonymize it). See the section on
  <b>ANONYMIZING</b> below.</div>
<p class="Pp">--reference-excluded-parents</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, running a command such as <b>git fast-export
  master~5..master</b> will not include the commit master~5 and will make
  master~4 no longer have master~5 as a parent (though both the old master~4 and
  new master~4 will have all the same files). Use --reference-excluded-parents
  to instead have the stream refer to commits in the excluded range of history
  by their sha1sum. Note that the resulting stream can only be used by a
  repository which already contains the necessary parent commits.</div>
<p class="Pp">--show-original-ids</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Add an extra directive to the output for commits and
  blobs, <b>original-oid &lt;SHA1SUM&gt;</b>. While such directives will likely
  be ignored by importers such as git-fast-import, it may be useful for
  intermediary filters (e.g. for rewriting commit messages which refer to older
  commits, or for stripping blobs by id).</div>
<p class="Pp">--reencode=(yes|no|abort)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify how to handle <b>encoding</b> header in commit
  objects. When asking to <i>abort</i> (which is the default), this program will
  die when encountering such a commit object. With <i>yes</i>, the commit
  message will be re-encoded into UTF-8. With <i>no</i>, the original encoding
  will be preserved.</div>
<p class="Pp">--refspec</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Apply the specified refspec to each ref exported.
  Multiple of them can be specified.</div>
<p class="Pp">[&lt;git-rev-list-args&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A list of arguments, acceptable to <i>git rev-parse</i>
  and <i>git rev-list</i>, that specifies the specific objects and references to
  export. For example, <b>master~10..master</b> causes the current master
  reference to be exported along with all objects added since its 10th ancestor
  commit and (unless the --reference-excluded-parents option is specified) all
  files common to master~9 and master~10.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git fast-export --all | (cd /empty/repository &amp;&amp; git fast-import)</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This will export the whole repository and import it into the
    existing empty repository. Except for reencoding commits that are not in
    UTF-8, it would be a one-to-one mirror.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git fast-export master~5..master |
        sed &quot;s|refs/heads/master|refs/heads/other|&quot; |
        git fast-import</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This makes a new branch called <i>other</i> from
    <i>master~5..master</i> (i.e. if <i>master</i> has linear history, it will
    take the last 5 commits).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that this assumes that none of the blobs and commit messages
    referenced by that revision range contains the string
    <i>refs/heads/master</i>.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ANONYMIZING"><a class="permalink" href="#ANONYMIZING">ANONYMIZING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>--anonymize</b> option is given, git will attempt to
    remove all identifying information from the repository while still retaining
    enough of the original tree and history patterns to reproduce some bugs. The
    goal is that a git bug which is found on a private repository will persist
    in the anonymized repository, and the latter can be shared with git
    developers to help solve the bug.</p>
<p class="Pp">With this option, git will replace all refnames, paths, blob
    contents, commit and tag messages, names, and email addresses in the output
    with anonymized data. Two instances of the same string will be replaced
    equivalently (e.g., two commits with the same author will have the same
    anonymized author in the output, but bear no resemblance to the original
    author string). The relationship between commits, branches, and tags is
    retained, as well as the commit timestamps (but the commit messages and
    refnames bear no resemblance to the originals). The relative makeup of the
    tree is retained (e.g., if you have a root tree with 10 files and 3 trees,
    so will the output), but their names and the contents of the files will be
    replaced.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you think you have found a git bug, you can start by exporting
    an anonymized stream of the whole repository:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git fast-export --anonymize --all &gt;anon-stream</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Then confirm that the bug persists in a repository created from
    that stream (many bugs will not, as they really do depend on the exact
    repository contents):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git init anon-repo
$ cd anon-repo
$ git fast-import &lt;../anon-stream
$ ... test your bug ...</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">If the anonymized repository shows the bug, it may be worth
    sharing <b>anon-stream</b> along with a regular bug report. Note that the
    anonymized stream compresses very well, so gzipping it is encouraged. If you
    want to examine the stream to see that it does not contain any private data,
    you can peruse it directly before sending. You may also want to try:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ perl -pe 's/\d+/X/g' &lt;anon-stream | sort -u | less</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">which shows all of the unique lines (with numbers converted to
    &quot;X&quot;, to collapse &quot;User 0&quot;, &quot;User 1&quot;, etc into
    &quot;User X&quot;). This produces a much smaller output, and it is usually
    easy to quickly confirm that there is no private data in the stream.</p>
<p class="Pp">Reproducing some bugs may require referencing particular commits
    or paths, which becomes challenging after refnames and paths have been
    anonymized. You can ask for a particular token to be left as-is or mapped to
    a new value. For example, if you have a bug which reproduces with <b>git
    rev-list sensitive -- secret.c</b>, you can run:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git fast-export --anonymize --all \
      --anonymize-map=sensitive:foo \
      --anonymize-map=secret.c:bar.c \
      &gt;stream</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">After importing the stream, you can then run <b>git rev-list foo
    -- bar.c</b> in the anonymized repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that paths and refnames are split into tokens at slash
    boundaries. The command above would anonymize <b>subdir/secret.c</b> as
    something like <b>path123/bar.c</b>; you could then search for <b>bar.c</b>
    in the anonymized repository to determine the final pathname.</p>
<p class="Pp">To make referencing the final pathname simpler, you can map each
    path component; so if you also anonymize <b>subdir</b> to <b>publicdir</b>,
    then the final pathname would be <b>publicdir/bar.c</b>.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="LIMITATIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#LIMITATIONS">LIMITATIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Since <i>git fast-import</i> cannot tag trees, you will not be
    able to export the linux.git repository completely, as it contains a tag
    referencing a tree instead of a commit.</p>
