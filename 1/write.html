<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">write</code> utility allows you to
    communicate with other users, by copying lines from your terminal to
  theirs.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you run the <code class="Nm">write</code> command, the user
    you are writing to gets a message of the form:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">Message from yourname@yourhost on
  yourtty at hh:mm ...</code></div>
<p class="Pp">Any further lines you enter will be copied to the specified user's
    terminal. If the other user wants to reply, they must run
    <code class="Nm">write</code> as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you are done, type an end-of-file or interrupt character. The
    other user will see the message &#x2018;<code class="Li">EOF</code>&#x2019;
    indicating that the conversation is over.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can prevent people (other than the super-user) from writing to
    you with the <a class="Xr" href="../1/mesg">mesg(1)</a> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the user you want to write to is logged in on more than one
    terminal, you can specify which terminal to write to by specifying the
    terminal name as the second operand to the <code class="Nm">write</code>
    command. Alternatively, you can let <code class="Nm">write</code> select one
    of the terminals - it will pick the one with the shortest idle time. This is
    so that if the user is logged in at work and also dialed up from home, the
    message will go to the right place.</p>
<p class="Pp">The traditional protocol for writing to someone is that the string
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">-o</code>&#x2019;, either at the end of a line or
    on a line by itself, means that it is the other person's turn to talk. The
    string &#x2018;<code class="Li">oo</code>&#x2019; means that the person
    believes the conversation to be over.</p>

<p class="Pp">The sender's <code class="Ev">LC_CTYPE</code> setting is used to

    receiver's (which <code class="Nm">write</code> has no way of knowing).</p>
