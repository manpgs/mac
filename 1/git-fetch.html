<p class="Pp">Fetch branches and/or tags (collectively, &quot;refs&quot;) from
    one or more other repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete
    their histories. Remote-tracking branches are updated (see the description
    of &lt;refspec&gt; below for ways to control this behavior).</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, any tag that points into the histories being fetched
    is also fetched; the effect is to fetch tags that point at branches that you
    are interested in. This default behavior can be changed by using the --tags
    or --no-tags options or by configuring remote.&lt;name&gt;.tagOpt. By using
    a refspec that fetches tags explicitly, you can fetch tags that do not point
    into branches you are interested in as well.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>git fetch</i> can fetch from either a single named repository
    or URL, or from several repositories at once if &lt;group&gt; is given and
    there is a remotes.&lt;group&gt; entry in the configuration file. (See
    <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>
<p class="Pp">When no remote is specified, by default the <b>origin</b> remote
    will be used, unless there&#x2019;s an upstream branch configured for the
    current branch.</p>
<p class="Pp">The names of refs that are fetched, together with the object names
    they point at, are written to <b>.git/FETCH_HEAD</b>. This information may
    be used by scripts or other git commands, such as <b>git-pull</b>(1).</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">--all</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Fetch all remotes.</div>
<p class="Pp">-a, --append</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Append ref names and object names of fetched refs to the
  existing contents of <b>.git/FETCH_HEAD</b>. Without this option old data in
  <b>.git/FETCH_HEAD</b> will be overwritten.</div>
<p class="Pp">--atomic</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use an atomic transaction to update local refs. Either
  all refs are updated, or on error, no refs are updated.</div>
<p class="Pp">--depth=&lt;depth&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit fetching to the specified number of commits from
  the tip of each remote branch history. If fetching to a <i>shallow</i>
  repository created by <b>git clone</b> with <b>--depth=&lt;depth&gt;</b>
  option (see <b>git-clone</b>(1)), deepen or shorten the history to the
  specified number of commits. Tags for the deepened commits are not
  fetched.</div>
<p class="Pp">--deepen=&lt;depth&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Similar to --depth, except it specifies the number of
  commits from the current shallow boundary instead of from the tip of each
  remote branch history.</div>
<p class="Pp">--shallow-since=&lt;date&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to
  include all reachable commits after &lt;date&gt;.</div>
<p class="Pp">--shallow-exclude=&lt;revision&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to
  exclude commits reachable from a specified remote branch or tag. This option
  can be specified multiple times.</div>
<p class="Pp">--unshallow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If the source repository is complete, convert a shallow
  repository to a complete one, removing all the limitations imposed by shallow
  repositories.
<p class="Pp">If the source repository is shallow, fetch as much as possible so
    that the current repository has the same history as the source
  repository.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--update-shallow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default when fetching from a shallow repository,
  <b>git fetch</b> refuses refs that require updating .git/shallow. This option
  updates .git/shallow and accept such refs.</div>
<p class="Pp">--negotiation-tip=&lt;commit|glob&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, Git will report, to the server, commits
  reachable from all local refs to find common commits in an attempt to reduce
  the size of the to-be-received packfile. If specified, Git will only report
  commits reachable from the given tips. This is useful to speed up fetches when
  the user knows which local ref is likely to have commits in common with the
  upstream ref being fetched.
<p class="Pp">This option may be specified more than once; if so, Git will
    report commits reachable from any of the given commits.</p>
<p class="Pp">The argument to this option may be a glob on ref names, a ref, or
    the (possibly abbreviated) SHA-1 of a commit. Specifying a glob is
    equivalent to specifying this option multiple times, one for each matching
    ref name.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also the <b>fetch.negotiationAlgorithm</b> and
    <b>push.negotiate</b> configuration variables documented in
    <b>git-config</b>(1), and the <b>--negotiate-only</b> option below.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--negotiate-only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not fetch anything from the server, and instead print
  the ancestors of the provided <b>--negotiation-tip=*</b> arguments, which we
  have in common with the server.
<p class="Pp">This is incompatible with
    <b>--recurse-submodules=[yes|on-demand]</b>. Internally this is used to
    implement the <b>push.negotiate</b> option, see <b>git-config</b>(1).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--dry-run</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show what would be done, without making any
  changes.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]write-fetch-head</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Write the list of remote refs fetched in the
  <b>FETCH_HEAD</b> file directly under <b>$GIT_DIR</b>. This is the default.
  Passing <b>--no-write-fetch-head</b> from the command line tells Git not to
  write the file. Under <b>--dry-run</b> option, the file is never
  written.</div>
<p class="Pp">-f, --force</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <i>git fetch</i> is used with
  <b>&lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt;</b> refspec it may refuse to update the local
  branch as discussed in the <b>&lt;refspec&gt;</b> part below. This option
  overrides that check.</div>
<p class="Pp">-k, --keep</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Keep downloaded pack.</div>
<p class="Pp">--multiple</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow several &lt;repository&gt; and &lt;group&gt;
  arguments to be specified. No &lt;refspec&gt;s may be specified.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]auto-maintenance, --[no-]auto-gc</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Run <b>git maintenance run --auto</b> at the end to
  perform automatic repository maintenance if needed. (<b>--[no-]auto-gc</b> is
  a synonym.) This is enabled by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]write-commit-graph</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Write a commit-graph after fetching. This overrides the
  config setting <b>fetch.writeCommitGraph</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--prefetch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Modify the configured refspec to place all refs into the
  <b>refs/prefetch/</b> namespace. See the <b>prefetch</b> task in
  <b>git-maintenance</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">-p, --prune</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Before fetching, remove any remote-tracking references
  that no longer exist on the remote. Tags are not subject to pruning if they
  are fetched only because of the default tag auto-following or due to a --tags
  option. However, if tags are fetched due to an explicit refspec (either on the
  command line or in the remote configuration, for example if the remote was
  cloned with the --mirror option), then they are also subject to pruning.
  Supplying <b>--prune-tags</b> is a shorthand for providing the tag refspec.
<p class="Pp">See the PRUNING section below for more details.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-P, --prune-tags</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Before fetching, remove any local tags that no longer
  exist on the remote if <b>--prune</b> is enabled. This option should be used
  more carefully, unlike <b>--prune</b> it will remove any local references
  (local tags) that have been created. This option is a shorthand for providing
  the explicit tag refspec along with <b>--prune</b>, see the discussion about
  that in its documentation.
<p class="Pp">See the PRUNING section below for more details.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-n, --no-tags</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, tags that point at objects that are
  downloaded from the remote repository are fetched and stored locally. This
  option disables this automatic tag following. The default behavior for a
  remote may be specified with the remote.&lt;name&gt;.tagOpt setting. See
  <b>git-config</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--refetch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of negotiating with the server to avoid
  transferring commits and associated objects that are already present locally,
  this option fetches all objects as a fresh clone would. Use this to reapply a
  partial clone filter from configuration or using <b>--filter=</b> when the
  filter definition has changed. Automatic post-fetch maintenance will perform
  object database pack consolidation to remove any duplicate objects.</div>
<p class="Pp">--refmap=&lt;refspec&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When fetching refs listed on the command line, use the
  specified refspec (can be given more than once) to map the refs to
  remote-tracking branches, instead of the values of <b>remote.*.fetch</b>
  configuration variables for the remote repository. Providing an empty
  <b>&lt;refspec&gt;</b> to the <b>--refmap</b> option causes Git to ignore the
  configured refspecs and rely entirely on the refspecs supplied as command-line
  arguments. See section on &quot;Configured Remote-tracking Branches&quot; for
  details.</div>
<p class="Pp">-t, --tags</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Fetch all tags from the remote (i.e., fetch remote tags
  <b>refs/tags/*</b> into local tags with the same name), in addition to
  whatever else would otherwise be fetched. Using this option alone does not
  subject tags to pruning, even if --prune is used (though tags may be pruned
  anyway if they are also the destination of an explicit refspec; see
  <b>--prune</b>).</div>
<p class="Pp">--recurse-submodules[=yes|on-demand|no]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option controls if and under what conditions new
  commits of submodules should be fetched too. When recursing through
  submodules, <b>git fetch</b> always attempts to fetch &quot;changed&quot;
  submodules, that is, a submodule that has commits that are referenced by a
  newly fetched superproject commit but are missing in the local submodule
  clone. A changed submodule can be fetched as long as it is present locally
  e.g. in <b>$GIT_DIR/modules/</b> (see <b>gitsubmodules</b>(7)); if the
  upstream adds a new submodule, that submodule cannot be fetched until it is
  cloned e.g. by <b>git submodule update</b>.
<p class="Pp">When set to <i>on-demand</i>, only changed submodules are fetched.
    When set to <i>yes</i>, all populated submodules are fetched and submodules
    that are both unpopulated and changed are fetched. When set to <i>no</i>,
    submodules are never fetched.</p>
<p class="Pp">When unspecified, this uses the value of
    <b>fetch.recurseSubmodules</b> if it is set (see <b>git-config</b>(1)),
    defaulting to <i>on-demand</i> if unset. When this option is used without
    any value, it defaults to <i>yes</i>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-j, --jobs=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Number of parallel children to be used for all forms of
  fetching.
<p class="Pp">If the <b>--multiple</b> option was specified, the different
    remotes will be fetched in parallel. If multiple submodules are fetched,
    they will be fetched in parallel. To control them independently, use the
    config settings <b>fetch.parallel</b> and <b>submodule.fetchJobs</b> (see
    <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>
<p class="Pp">Typically, parallel recursive and multi-remote fetches will be
    faster. By default fetches are performed sequentially, not in parallel.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-recurse-submodules</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disable recursive fetching of submodules (this has the
  same effect as using the <b>--recurse-submodules=no</b> option).</div>
<p class="Pp">--set-upstream</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If the remote is fetched successfully, add upstream
  (tracking) reference, used by argument-less <b>git-pull</b>(1) and other
  commands. For more information, see <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</b> and
  <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</b> in <b>git-config</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--submodule-prefix=&lt;path&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prepend &lt;path&gt; to paths printed in informative
  messages such as &quot;Fetching submodule foo&quot;. This option is used
  internally when recursing over submodules.</div>
<p class="Pp">--recurse-submodules-default=[yes|on-demand]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is used internally to temporarily provide a
  non-negative default value for the --recurse-submodules option. All other
  methods of configuring fetch&#x2019;s submodule recursion (such as settings in
  <b>gitmodules</b>(5) and <b>git-config</b>(1)) override this option, as does
  specifying --[no-]recurse-submodules directly.</div>
<p class="Pp">-u, --update-head-ok</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default <i>git fetch</i> refuses to update the head
  which corresponds to the current branch. This flag disables the check. This is
  purely for the internal use for <i>git pull</i> to communicate with <i>git
  fetch</i>, and unless you are implementing your own Porcelain you are not
  supposed to use it.</div>
<p class="Pp">--upload-pack &lt;upload-pack&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When given, and the repository to fetch from is handled
  by <i>git fetch-pack</i>, <b>--exec=&lt;upload-pack&gt;</b> is passed to the
  command to specify non-default path for the command run on the other
  end.</div>
<p class="Pp">-q, --quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pass --quiet to git-fetch-pack and silence any other
  internally used git commands. Progress is not reported to the standard error
  stream.</div>
<p class="Pp">-v, --verbose</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Be verbose.</div>
<p class="Pp">--progress</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Progress status is reported on the standard error stream
  by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless -q is specified. This
  flag forces progress status even if the standard error stream is not directed
  to a terminal.</div>
<p class="Pp">-o &lt;option&gt;, --server-option=&lt;option&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Transmit the given string to the server when
  communicating using protocol version 2. The given string must not contain a
  NUL or LF character. The server&#x2019;s handling of server options, including
  unknown ones, is server-specific. When multiple
  <b>--server-option=&lt;option&gt;</b> are given, they are all sent to the
  other side in the order listed on the command line.</div>
<p class="Pp">--show-forced-updates</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, git checks if a branch is force-updated
  during fetch. This can be disabled through fetch.showForcedUpdates, but the
  --show-forced-updates option guarantees this check occurs. See
  <b>git-config</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-show-forced-updates</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, git checks if a branch is force-updated
  during fetch. Pass --no-show-forced-updates or set fetch.showForcedUpdates to
  false to skip this check for performance reasons. If used during
  <i>git-pull</i> the --ff-only option will still check for forced updates
  before attempting a fast-forward update. See <b>git-config</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">-4, --ipv4</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use IPv4 addresses only, ignoring IPv6 addresses.</div>
<p class="Pp">-6, --ipv6</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use IPv6 addresses only, ignoring IPv4 addresses.</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;repository&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The &quot;remote&quot; repository that is the source of a
  fetch or pull operation. This parameter can be either a URL (see the section
  GIT URLS below) or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES below).</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;group&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A name referring to a list of repositories as the value
  of remotes.&lt;group&gt; in the configuration file. (See
  <b>git-config</b>(1)).</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;refspec&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies which refs to fetch and which local refs to
  update. When no &lt;refspec&gt;s appear on the command line, the refs to fetch
  are read from <b>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.fetch</b> variables instead (see
  CONFIGURED REMOTE-TRACKING BRANCHES below).
<p class="Pp">The format of a &lt;refspec&gt; parameter is an optional plus
    <b>+</b>, followed by the source &lt;src&gt;, followed by a colon <b>:</b>,
    followed by the destination ref &lt;dst&gt;. The colon can be omitted when
    &lt;dst&gt; is empty. &lt;src&gt; is typically a ref, but it can also be a
    fully spelled hex object name.</p>
<p class="Pp">A &lt;refspec&gt; may contain a <b>*</b> in its &lt;src&gt; to
    indicate a simple pattern match. Such a refspec functions like a glob that
    matches any ref with the same prefix. A pattern &lt;refspec&gt; must have a
    <b>*</b> in both the &lt;src&gt; and &lt;dst&gt;. It will map refs to the
    destination by replacing the <b>*</b> with the contents matched from the
    source.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a refspec is prefixed by <b>^</b>, it will be interpreted as a
    negative refspec. Rather than specifying which refs to fetch or which local
    refs to update, such a refspec will instead specify refs to exclude. A ref
    will be considered to match if it matches at least one positive refspec, and
    does not match any negative refspec. Negative refspecs can be useful to
    restrict the scope of a pattern refspec so that it will not include specific
    refs. Negative refspecs can themselves be pattern refspecs. However, they
    may only contain a &lt;src&gt; and do not specify a &lt;dst&gt;. Fully
    spelled out hex object names are also not supported.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>tag &lt;tag&gt;</b> means the same as
    <b>refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;:refs/tags/&lt;tag&gt;</b>; it requests fetching
    everything up to the given tag.</p>
<p class="Pp">The remote ref that matches &lt;src&gt; is fetched, and if
    &lt;dst&gt; is not an empty string, an attempt is made to update the local
    ref that matches it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whether that update is allowed without <b>--force</b> depends on
    the ref namespace it&#x2019;s being fetched to, the type of object being
    fetched, and whether the update is considered to be a fast-forward.
    Generally, the same rules apply for fetching as when pushing, see the
    <b>&lt;refspec&gt;...</b> section of <b>git-push</b>(1) for what those are.
    Exceptions to those rules particular to <i>git fetch</i> are noted
  below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Until Git version 2.20, and unlike when pushing with
    <b>git-push</b>(1), any updates to <b>refs/tags/*</b> would be accepted
    without <b>+</b> in the refspec (or <b>--force</b>). When fetching, we
    promiscuously considered all tag updates from a remote to be forced fetches.
    Since Git version 2.20, fetching to update <b>refs/tags/*</b> works the same
    way as when pushing. I.e. any updates will be rejected without <b>+</b> in
    the refspec (or <b>--force</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike when pushing with <b>git-push</b>(1), any updates outside
    of <b>refs/{tags,heads}/*</b> will be accepted without <b>+</b> in the
    refspec (or <b>--force</b>), whether that&#x2019;s swapping e.g. a tree
    object for a blob, or a commit for another commit that&#x2019;s
    doesn&#x2019;t have the previous commit as an ancestor etc.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike when pushing with <b>git-push</b>(1), there is no
    configuration which&#x2019;ll amend these rules, and nothing like a
    <b>pre-fetch</b> hook analogous to the <b>pre-receive</b> hook.</p>
<p class="Pp">As with pushing with <b>git-push</b>(1), all of the rules
    described above about what&#x2019;s not allowed as an update can be
    overridden by adding an the optional leading <b>+</b> to a refspec (or using
    <b>--force</b> command line option). The only exception to this is that no
    amount of forcing will make the <b>refs/heads/*</b> namespace accept a
    non-commit object.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<br/>
<b>Note</b>
<br/>
When the remote branch you want to fetch is known to be rewound and rebased
  regularly, it is expected that its new tip will not be descendant of its
  previous tip (as stored in your remote-tracking branch the last time you
  fetched). You would want to use the <b>+</b> sign to indicate non-fast-forward
  updates will be needed for such branches. There is no way to determine or
  declare that a branch will be made available in a repository with this
  behavior; the pulling user simply must know this is the expected usage pattern
  for a branch.
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--stdin</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Read refspecs, one per line, from stdin in addition to
  those provided as arguments. The &quot;tag &lt;name&gt;&quot; format is not
  supported.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="GIT_URLS"><a class="permalink" href="#GIT_URLS">GIT
  URLS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol,
    the address of the remote server, and the path to the repository. Depending
    on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent.</p>
<p class="Pp">Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition,
    ftp, and ftps can be used for fetching, but this is inefficient and
    deprecated; do not use it).</p>
<p class="Pp">The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and
    should be used with caution on unsecured networks.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following syntaxes may be used with them:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;git://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;http[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;ftp[s]://host.xz[:port]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp">An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh
    protocol:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;[user@]host.xz:path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp">This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the
    first colon. This helps differentiate a local path that contains a colon.
    For example the local path <b>foo:bar</b> could be specified as an absolute
    path or <b>./foo:bar</b> to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh url.</p>
<p class="Pp">The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~username
    expansion:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;ssh://[user@]host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;git://host.xz[:port]/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;[user@]host.xz:/~[user]/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp">For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the
    following syntaxes may be used:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;/path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;file:///path/to/repo.git/</div>
<p class="Pp">These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning,
    when the former implies --local option. See <b>git-clone</b>(1) for
  details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>git clone</i>, <i>git fetch</i> and <i>git pull</i>, but not
    <i>git push</i>, will also accept a suitable bundle file. See
    <b>git-bundle</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">When Git doesn&#x2019;t know how to handle a certain transport
    protocol, it attempts to use the <i>remote-&lt;transport&gt;</i> remote
    helper, if one exists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the following
    syntax may be used:</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURED_REMOTE"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURED_REMOTE">CONFIGURED
  REMOTE-TRACKING BRANCHES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">You often interact with the same remote repository by regularly
    and repeatedly fetching from it. In order to keep track of the progress of
    such a remote repository, <b>git fetch</b> allows you to configure
    <b>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.fetch</b> configuration variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">Typically such a variable may look like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>[remote &quot;origin&quot;]
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This configuration is used in two ways:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;When <b>git fetch</b> is run without specifying
  what branches and/or tags to fetch on the command line, e.g. <b>git fetch
  origin</b> or <b>git fetch</b>, <b>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.fetch</b> values
  are used as the refspecs&#x2014;they specify which refs to fetch and which
  local refs to update. The example above will fetch all branches that exist in
  the <b>origin</b> (i.e. any ref that matches the left-hand side of the value,
  <b>refs/heads/*</b>) and update the corresponding remote-tracking branches in
  the <b>refs/remotes/origin/*</b> hierarchy.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;When <b>git fetch</b> is run with explicit
  branches and/or tags to fetch on the command line, e.g. <b>git fetch origin
  master</b>, the &lt;refspec&gt;s given on the command line determine what are
  to be fetched (e.g. <b>master</b> in the example, which is a short-hand for
  <b>master:</b>, which in turn means &quot;fetch the <i>master</i> branch but I
  do not explicitly say what remote-tracking branch to update with it from the
  command line&quot;), and the example command will fetch <i>only</i> the
  <i>master</i> branch. The <b>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.fetch</b> values
  determine which remote-tracking branch, if any, is updated. When used in this
  way, the <b>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.fetch</b> values do not have any effect
  in deciding <i>what</i> gets fetched (i.e. the values are not used as refspecs
  when the command-line lists refspecs); they are only used to decide
  <i>where</i> the refs that are fetched are stored by acting as a
  mapping.</div>
<p class="Pp">The latter use of the <b>remote.&lt;repository&gt;.fetch</b>
    values can be overridden by giving the <b>--refmap=&lt;refspec&gt;</b>
    parameter(s) on the command line.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PRUNING"><a class="permalink" href="#PRUNING">PRUNING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Git has a default disposition of keeping data unless it&#x2019;s
    explicitly thrown away; this extends to holding onto local references to
    branches on remotes that have themselves deleted those branches.</p>
<p class="Pp">If left to accumulate, these stale references might make
    performance worse on big and busy repos that have a lot of branch churn, and
    e.g. make the output of commands like <b>git branch -a --contains
    &lt;commit&gt;</b> needlessly verbose, as well as impacting anything else
    that&#x2019;ll work with the complete set of known references.</p>
<p class="Pp">These remote-tracking references can be deleted as a one-off with
    either of:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre># While fetching
$ git fetch --prune &lt;name&gt;
# Only prune, don't fetch
$ git remote prune &lt;name&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">To prune references as part of your normal workflow without
    needing to remember to run that, set <b>fetch.prune</b> globally, or
    <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.prune</b> per-remote in the config. See
    <b>git-config</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">Here&#x2019;s where things get tricky and more specific. The
    pruning feature doesn&#x2019;t actually care about branches, instead
    it&#x2019;ll prune local &#x2190;&#x2192; remote-references as a function of
    the refspec of the remote (see <b>&lt;refspec&gt;</b> and CONFIGURED
    REMOTE-TRACKING BRANCHES above).</p>
<p class="Pp">Therefore if the refspec for the remote includes e.g.
    <b>refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*</b>, or you manually run e.g. <b>git fetch
    --prune &lt;name&gt; &quot;refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*&quot;</b> it won&#x2019;t
    be stale remote tracking branches that are deleted, but any local tag that
    doesn&#x2019;t exist on the remote.</p>
<p class="Pp">This might not be what you expect, i.e. you want to prune remote
    <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>, but also explicitly fetch tags from it, so when you
    fetch from it you delete all your local tags, most of which may not have
    come from the <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> remote in the first place.</p>
<p class="Pp">So be careful when using this with a refspec like
    <b>refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*</b>, or any other refspec which might map
    references from multiple remotes to the same local namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since keeping up-to-date with both branches and tags on the remote
    is a common use-case the <b>--prune-tags</b> option can be supplied along
    with <b>--prune</b> to prune local tags that don&#x2019;t exist on the
    remote, and force-update those tags that differ. Tag pruning can also be
    enabled with <b>fetch.pruneTags</b> or <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.pruneTags</b>
    in the config. See <b>git-config</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>--prune-tags</b> option is equivalent to having
    <b>refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*</b> declared in the refspecs of the remote. This
    can lead to some seemingly strange interactions:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre># These both fetch tags
$ git fetch --no-tags origin 'refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*'
$ git fetch --no-tags --prune-tags origin</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The reason it doesn&#x2019;t error out when provided without
    <b>--prune</b> or its config versions is for flexibility of the configured
    versions, and to maintain a 1=1 mapping between what the command line flags
    do, and what the configuration versions do.</p>
<p class="Pp">It&#x2019;s reasonable to e.g. configure
    <b>fetch.pruneTags=true</b> in <b>~/.gitconfig</b> to have tags pruned
    whenever <b>git fetch --prune</b> is run, without making every invocation of
    <b>git fetch</b> without <b>--prune</b> an error.</p>
<p class="Pp">Pruning tags with <b>--prune-tags</b> also works when fetching a
    URL instead of a named remote. These will all prune tags not found on
    origin:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git fetch origin --prune --prune-tags
$ git fetch origin --prune 'refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*'
$ git fetch &lt;url of origin&gt; --prune --prune-tags
$ git fetch &lt;url of origin&gt; --prune 'refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*'</pre>

<p class="Pp">The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side
    from stealing data from the other repository that was not intended to be
    shared. If you have private data that you need to protect from a malicious
    peer, your best option is to store it in another repository. This applies to
    both clients and servers. In particular, namespaces on a server are not
    effective for read access control; you should only grant read access to a
    namespace to clients that you would trust with read access to the entire
    repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">The known attack vectors are as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.The victim sends &quot;have&quot; lines advertising
  the IDs of objects it has that are not explicitly intended to be shared but
  can be used to optimize the transfer if the peer also has them. The attacker
  chooses an object ID X to steal and sends a ref to X, but isn&#x2019;t
  required to send the content of X because the victim already has it. Now the
  victim believes that the attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back to
  the attacker later. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to
  perform on a server, by creating a ref to X in the namespace the client has
  access to and then fetching it. The most likely way for a server to perform it
  on a client is to &quot;merge&quot; X into a public branch and hope that the
  user does additional work on this branch and pushes it back to the server
  without noticing the merge.)</div>

<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to

  attacker.</div>

  option of <b>git-fetch</b>(1) is in effect).
<p class="Pp">A value of 0 will give some reasonable default. If unset, it
    defaults to 1.</p>
<p class="Pp">For submodules, this setting can be overridden using the
    <b>submodule.fetchJobs</b> config setting.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">fetch.writeCommitGraph</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set to true to write a commit-graph after every <b>git
  fetch</b> command that downloads a pack-file from a remote. Using the
  <b>--split</b> option, most executions will create a very small commit-graph
  file on top of the existing commit-graph file(s). Occasionally, these files
  will merge and the write may take longer. Having an updated commit-graph file
  helps performance of many Git commands, including <b>git merge-base</b>,
  <b>git push -f</b>, and <b>git log --graph</b>. Defaults to false.</div>

<section class="Sh">

<p class="Pp">Using --recurse-submodules can only fetch new commits in
    submodules that are present locally e.g. in <b>$GIT_DIR/modules/</b>. If the
    upstream adds a new submodule, that submodule cannot be fetched until it is
    cloned e.g. by <b>git submodule update</b>. This is expected to be fixed in
    a future Git version.</p>
