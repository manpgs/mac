<p class="Pp">In a workflow employing relatively long lived topic branches, the
    developer sometimes needs to resolve the same conflicts over and over again
    until the topic branches are done (either merged to the &quot;release&quot;
    branch, or sent out and accepted upstream).</p>
<p class="Pp">This command assists the developer in this process by recording
    conflicted automerge results and corresponding hand resolve results on the
    initial manual merge, and applying previously recorded hand resolutions to
    their corresponding automerge results.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">You need to set the configuration variable <b>rerere.enabled</b>
    in order to enable this command.</p>

<p class="Pp">Normally, <i>git rerere</i> is run without arguments or
    user-intervention. However, it has several commands that allow it to
    interact with its working state.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>clear</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Reset the metadata used by rerere if a merge resolution
  is to be aborted. Calling <i>git am [--skip|--abort]</i> or <i>git rebase
  [--skip|--abort]</i> will automatically invoke this command.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>forget</i> &lt;pathspec&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Reset the conflict resolutions which rerere has recorded
  for the current conflict in &lt;pathspec&gt;.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>diff</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Display diffs for the current state of the resolution. It
  is useful for tracking what has changed while the user is resolving conflicts.
  Additional arguments are passed directly to the system <i>diff</i> command
  installed in PATH.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>status</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print paths with conflicts whose merge resolution rerere
  will record.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>remaining</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print paths with conflicts that have not been
  autoresolved by rerere. This includes paths whose resolutions cannot be
  tracked by rerere, such as conflicting submodules.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>gc</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prune records of conflicted merges that occurred a long
  time ago. By default, unresolved conflicts older than 15 days and resolved
  conflicts older than 60 days are pruned. These defaults are controlled via the
  <b>gc.rerereUnresolved</b> and <b>gc.rerereResolved</b> configuration
  variables respectively.</div>

<p class="Pp">When your topic branch modifies an overlapping area that your
    master branch (or upstream) touched since your topic branch forked from it,
    you may want to test it with the latest master, even before your topic
    branch is ready to be pushed upstream:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
              o---*---o topic
             /
    o---o---o---*---o---o master</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">For such a test, you need to merge master and topic somehow. One
    way to do it is to pull master into the topic branch:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        $ git switch topic
        $ git merge master
              o---*---o---+ topic
             /           /
    o---o---o---*---o---o master</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The commits marked with <b>*</b> touch the same area in the same
    file; you need to resolve the conflicts when creating the commit marked with
    <b>+</b>. Then you can test the result to make sure your work-in-progress
    still works with what is in the latest master.</p>
<p class="Pp">After this test merge, there are two ways to continue your work on
    the topic. The easiest is to build on top of the test merge commit <b>+</b>,
    and when your work in the topic branch is finally ready, pull the topic
    branch into master, and/or ask the upstream to pull from you. By that time,
    however, the master or the upstream might have been advanced since the test
    merge <b>+</b>, in which case the final commit graph would look like
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        $ git switch topic
        $ git merge master
        $ ... work on both topic and master branches
        $ git switch master
        $ git merge topic
              o---*---o---+---o---o topic
             /           /         \
    o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o---+ master</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">When your topic branch is long-lived, however, your topic branch
    would end up having many such &quot;Merge from master&quot; commits on it,
    which would unnecessarily clutter the development history. Readers of the
    Linux kernel mailing list may remember that Linus complained about such too
    frequent test merges when a subsystem maintainer asked to pull from a branch
    full of &quot;useless merges&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">As an alternative, to keep the topic branch clean of test merges,
    you could blow away the test merge, and keep building on top of the tip
    before the test merge:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        $ git switch topic
        $ git merge master
        $ git reset --hard HEAD^ ;# rewind the test merge
        $ ... work on both topic and master branches
        $ git switch master
        $ git merge topic
              o---*---o-------o---o topic
             /                     \
    o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o---+ master</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">This would leave only one merge commit when your topic branch is
    finally ready and merged into the master branch. This merge would require
    you to resolve the conflict, introduced by the commits marked with <b>*</b>.
    However, this conflict is often the same conflict you resolved when you
    created the test merge you blew away. <i>git rerere</i> helps you resolve
    this final conflicted merge using the information from your earlier hand
    resolve.</p>
<p class="Pp">Running the <i>git rerere</i> command immediately after a
    conflicted automerge records the conflicted working tree files, with the
    usual conflict markers <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</b>, <b>=======</b>,
    and <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</b> in them. Later, after you are done
    resolving the conflicts, running <i>git rerere</i> again will record the
    resolved state of these files. Suppose you did this when you created the
    test merge of master into the topic branch.</p>
<p class="Pp">Next time, after seeing the same conflicted automerge, running
    <i>git rerere</i> will perform a three-way merge between the earlier
    conflicted automerge, the earlier manual resolution, and the current
    conflicted automerge. If this three-way merge resolves cleanly, the result
    is written out to your working tree file, so you do not have to manually
    resolve it. Note that <i>git rerere</i> leaves the index file alone, so you
    still need to do the final sanity checks with <b>git diff</b> (or <b>git
    diff -c</b>) and <i>git add</i> when you are satisfied.</p>
<p class="Pp">As a convenience measure, <i>git merge</i> automatically invokes
    <i>git rerere</i> upon exiting with a failed automerge and <i>git rerere</i>
    records the hand resolve when it is a new conflict, or reuses the earlier
    hand resolve when it is not. <i>git commit</i> also invokes <i>git
    rerere</i> when committing a merge result. What this means is that you do
    not have to do anything special yourself (besides enabling the
    rerere.enabled config variable).</p>
<p class="Pp">In our example, when you do the test merge, the manual resolution
    is recorded, and it will be reused when you do the actual merge later with
    the updated master and topic branch, as long as the recorded resolution is
    still applicable.</p>
<p class="Pp">The information <i>git rerere</i> records is also used when
    running <i>git rebase</i>. After blowing away the test merge and continuing
    development on the topic branch:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
              o---*---o-------o---o topic
             /
    o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o   master
        $ git rebase master topic
                                  o---*---o-------o---o topic
                                 /
    o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o   master</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">you could run <b>git rebase master topic</b>, to bring yourself up
    to date before your topic is ready to be sent upstream. This would result in
    falling back to a three-way merge, and it would conflict the same way as the
    test merge you resolved earlier. <i>git rerere</i> will be run by <i>git
    rebase</i> to help you resolve this conflict.</p>
<p class="Pp">[NOTE] <i>git rerere</i> relies on the conflict markers in the
    file to detect the conflict. If the file already contains lines that look
    the same as lines with conflict markers, <i>git rerere</i> may fail to
    record a conflict resolution. To work around this, the
    <b>conflict-marker-size</b> setting in <b>gitattributes</b>(5) can be
  used.</p>
