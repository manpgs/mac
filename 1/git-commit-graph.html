<div class="Bd-indent">Use given directory for the location of packfiles and
  commit-graph file. This parameter exists to specify the location of an
  alternate that only has the objects directory, not a full <b>.git</b>
  directory. The commit-graph file is expected to be in the
  <b>&lt;dir&gt;/info</b> directory and the packfiles are expected to be in
  <b>&lt;dir&gt;/pack</b>. If the directory could not be made into an absolute
  path, or does not match any known object directory, <b>git commit-graph
  ...</b> will exit with non-zero status.</div>

<p class="Pp"><i>write</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Write a commit-graph file based on the commits found in
  packfiles. If the config option <b>core.commitGraph</b> is disabled, then this
  command will output a warning, then return success without writing a
  commit-graph file.
<p class="Pp">With the <b>--stdin-packs</b> option, generate the new commit
    graph by walking objects only in the specified pack-indexes. (Cannot be
    combined with <b>--stdin-commits</b> or <b>--reachable</b>.)</p>
<p class="Pp">With the <b>--stdin-commits</b> option, generate the new commit
    graph by walking commits starting at the commits specified in stdin as a
    list of OIDs in hex, one OID per line. OIDs that resolve to non-commits
    (either directly, or by peeling tags) are silently ignored. OIDs that are
    malformed, or do not exist generate an error. (Cannot be combined with
    <b>--stdin-packs</b> or <b>--reachable</b>.)</p>
<p class="Pp">With the <b>--reachable</b> option, generate the new commit graph
    by walking commits starting at all refs. (Cannot be combined with
    <b>--stdin-commits</b> or <b>--stdin-packs</b>.)</p>
<p class="Pp">With the <b>--append</b> option, include all commits that are
    present in the existing commit-graph file.</p>
<p class="Pp">With the <b>--changed-paths</b> option, compute and write
    information about the paths changed between a commit and its first parent.
    This operation can take a while on large repositories. It provides
    significant performance gains for getting history of a directory or a file
    with <b>git log -- &lt;path&gt;</b>. If this option is given, future
    commit-graph writes will automatically assume that this option was intended.
    Use <b>--no-changed-paths</b> to stop storing this data.</p>
<p class="Pp">With the <b>--max-new-filters=&lt;n&gt;</b> option, generate at
    most <b>n</b> new Bloom filters (if <b>--changed-paths</b> is specified). If
    <b>n</b> is <b>-1</b>, no limit is enforced. Only commits present in the new
    layer count against this limit. To retroactively compute Bloom filters over
    earlier layers, it is advised to use <b>--split=replace</b>. Overrides the
    <b>commitGraph.maxNewFilters</b> configuration.</p>
<p class="Pp">With the <b>--split[=&lt;strategy&gt;]</b> option, write the
    commit-graph as a chain of multiple commit-graph files stored in
    <b>&lt;dir&gt;/info/commit-graphs</b>. Commit-graph layers are merged based
    on the strategy and other splitting options. The new commits not already in
    the commit-graph are added in a new &quot;tip&quot; file. This file is
    merged with the existing file if the following merge conditions are met:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If <b>--split=no-merge</b> is specified, a merge
  is never performed, and the remaining options are ignored.
  <b>--split=replace</b> overwrites the existing chain with a new one. A bare
  <b>--split</b> defers to the remaining options. (Note that merging a chain of
  commit graphs replaces the existing chain with a length-1 chain where the
  first and only incremental holds the entire graph).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If <b>--size-multiple=&lt;X&gt;</b> is not
  specified, let <b>X</b> equal 2. If the new tip file would have <b>N</b>
  commits and the previous tip has <b>M</b> commits and <b>X</b> times <b>N</b>
  is greater than <b>M</b>, instead merge the two files into a single
  file.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If <b>--max-commits=&lt;M&gt;</b> is specified
  with <b>M</b> a positive integer, and the new tip file would have more than
  <b>M</b> commits, then instead merge the new tip with the previous tip.
<p class="Pp">Finally, if <b>--expire-time=&lt;datetime&gt;</b> is not
    specified, let <b>datetime</b> be the current time. After writing the split
    commit-graph, delete all unused commit-graph whose modified times are older
    than <b>datetime</b>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>verify</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Read the commit-graph file and verify its contents
  against the object database. Used to check for corrupted data.
<p class="Pp">With the <b>--shallow</b> option, only check the tip commit-graph
    file in a chain of split commit-graphs.</p>
