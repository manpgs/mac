<p class="Pp"><b>Tset</b> initializes terminals. <b>Tset</b> first determines
    the type of terminal that you are using. This determination is done as
    follows, using the first terminal type found.</p>
<p class="Pp">1. The <b>terminal</b> argument specified on the command line.</p>
<p class="Pp">2. The value of the <b>TERM</b> environmental variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">3. (BSD systems only.) The terminal type associated with the
    standard error output device in the <i>/etc/ttys</i> file. (On System-V-like
    UNIXes and systems using that convention, <i>getty</i> does this job by
    setting <b>TERM</b> according to the type passed to it by
    <i>/etc/inittab</i>.)</p>
<p class="Pp">4. The default terminal type, &#x201C;unknown&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the terminal type was not specified on the command-line, the
    <b>-m</b> option mappings are then applied (see the section <b>TERMINAL TYPE
    MAPPING</b> for more information). Then, if the terminal type begins with a
    question mark (&#x201C;?&#x201D;), the user is prompted for confirmation of
    the terminal type. An empty response confirms the type, or, another type can
    be entered to specify a new type. Once the terminal type has been
    determined, the terminfo entry for the terminal is retrieved. If no terminfo
    entry is found for the type, the user is prompted for another terminal
  type.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once the terminfo entry is retrieved, the window size, backspace,
    interrupt and line kill characters (among many other things) are set and the
    terminal and tab initialization strings are sent to the standard error
    output. Finally, if the erase, interrupt and line kill characters have
    changed, or are not set to their default values, their values are displayed
    to the standard error output. Use the <b>-c</b> or <b>-w</b> option to
    select only the window sizing versus the other initialization. If neither
    option is given, both are assumed.</p>
<p class="Pp">When invoked as <b>reset</b>, <b>@TSET@</b> sets cooked and echo
    modes, turns off cbreak and raw modes, turns on newline translation and
    resets any unset special characters to their default values before doing the
    terminal initialization described above. This is useful after a program dies
    leaving a terminal in an abnormal state. Note, you may have to type</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
   <b>&lt;LF&gt;reset&lt;LF&gt;</b></p>
<p class="Pp">(the line-feed character is normally control-J) to get the
    terminal to work, as carriage-return may no longer work in the abnormal
    state. Also, the terminal will often not echo the command.</p>
<p class="Pp">The options are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="c"><a class="permalink" href="#c"><b>-c</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Set control characters and modes.</dd>
  <dt id="e"><a class="permalink" href="#e"><b>-e</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Set the erase character to <i>ch</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="I"><a class="permalink" href="#I"><b>-I</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not send the terminal or tab initialization strings to the
    terminal.</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><b>-i</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Set the interrupt character to <i>ch</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="k"><a class="permalink" href="#k"><b>-k</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Set the line kill character to <i>ch</i>.</dd>
  <dt id="m"><a class="permalink" href="#m"><b>-m</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Specify a mapping from a port type to a terminal. See the section
      <b>TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING</b> for more information.</dd>
  <dt id="Q"><a class="permalink" href="#Q"><b>-Q</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not display any values for the erase, interrupt and line kill
      characters. Normally <b>@TSET@</b> displays the values for control
      characters which differ from the system's default values.</dd>
  <dt id="q"><a class="permalink" href="#q"><b>-q</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The terminal type is displayed to the standard output, and the terminal is
      not initialized in any way. The option `-' by itself is equivalent but
      archaic.</dd>
  <dt id="r"><a class="permalink" href="#r"><b>-r</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print the terminal type to the standard error output.</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><b>-s</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print the sequence of shell commands to initialize the environment
      variable <b>TERM</b> to the standard output. See the section <b>SETTING
      THE ENVIRONMENT</b> for details.</dd>
  <dt id="V"><a class="permalink" href="#V"><b>-V</b></a></dt>
  <dd>reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and
    exits.</dd>
  <dt id="w"><a class="permalink" href="#w"><b>-w</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Resize the window to match the size deduced via <b>setupterm</b>. Normally
      this has no effect, unless <b>setupterm</b> is not able to detect the
      window size.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The arguments for the <b>-e</b>, <b>-i</b>, and <b>-k</b> options
    may either be entered as actual characters or by using the `hat' notation,
    i.e., control-h may be specified as &#x201C;^H&#x201D; or
    &#x201C;^h&#x201D;.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SETTING_THE_ENVIRONMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#SETTING_THE_ENVIRONMENT">SETTING
  THE ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">It is often desirable to enter the terminal type and information
    about the terminal's capabilities into the shell's environment. This is done
    using the <b>-s</b> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the <b>-s</b> option is specified, the commands to enter the
    information into the shell's environment are written to the standard output.
    If the <b>SHELL</b> environmental variable ends in &#x201C;csh&#x201D;, the
    commands are for <b>csh</b>, otherwise, they are for <b>sh</b>. Note, the
    <b>csh</b> commands set and unset the shell variable <b>noglob</b>, leaving
    it unset. The following line in the <b>.login</b> or <b>.profile</b> files
    will initialize the environment correctly:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
   eval `@TSET@ -s options ... `</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TERMINAL_TYPE_MAPPING"><a class="permalink" href="#TERMINAL_TYPE_MAPPING">TERMINAL
  TYPE MAPPING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When the terminal is not hardwired into the system (or the current
    system information is incorrect) the terminal type derived from the
    <i>/etc/ttys</i> file or the <b>TERM</b> environmental variable is often
    something generic like <b>network</b>, <b>dialup</b>, or <b>unknown</b>.
    When <b>@TSET@</b> is used in a startup script it is often desirable to
    provide information about the type of terminal used on such ports.</p>
<p class="Pp">The purpose of the <b>-m</b> option is to map from some set of
    conditions to a terminal type, that is, to tell <b>@TSET@</b> &#x201C;If I'm
    on this port at a particular speed, guess that I'm on that kind of
    terminal&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The argument to the <b>-m</b> option consists of an optional port
    type, an optional operator, an optional baud rate specification, an optional
    colon (&#x201C;:&#x201D;) character and a terminal type. The port type is a
    string (delimited by either the operator or the colon character). The
    operator may be any combination of &#x201C;&gt;&#x201D;,
    &#x201C;&lt;&#x201D;, &#x201C;@&#x201D;, and &#x201C;!&#x201D;;
    &#x201C;&gt;&#x201D; means greater than, &#x201C;&lt;&#x201D; means less
    than, &#x201C;@&#x201D; means equal to and &#x201C;!&#x201D; inverts the
    sense of the test. The baud rate is specified as a number and is compared
    with the speed of the standard error output (which should be the control
    terminal). The terminal type is a string.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the terminal type is not specified on the command line, the
    <b>-m</b> mappings are applied to the terminal type. If the port type and
    baud rate match the mapping, the terminal type specified in the mapping
    replaces the current type. If more than one mapping is specified, the first
    applicable mapping is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, consider the following mapping:
    <b>dialup&gt;9600:vt100</b>. The port type is dialup , the operator is &gt;,
    the baud rate specification is 9600, and the terminal type is vt100. The
    result of this mapping is to specify that if the terminal type is
    <b>dialup</b>, and the baud rate is greater than 9600 baud, a terminal type
    of <b>vt100</b> will be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no baud rate is specified, the terminal type will match any
    baud rate. If no port type is specified, the terminal type will match any
    port type. For example, <b>-m dialup:vt100 -m :?xterm</b> will cause any
    dialup port, regardless of baud rate, to match the terminal type vt100, and
    any non-dialup port type to match the terminal type ?xterm. Note, because of
    the leading question mark, the user will be queried on a default port as to
    whether they are actually using an xterm terminal.</p>
<p class="Pp">No whitespace characters are permitted in the <b>-m</b> option
    argument. Also, to avoid problems with meta-characters, it is suggested that
    the entire <b>-m</b> option argument be placed within single quote
    characters, and that <b>csh</b> users insert a backslash character
    (&#x201C;\&#x201D;) before any exclamation marks (&#x201C;!&#x201D;).</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="HISTORY"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>@TSET@</b> command appeared in BSD 3.0. The <b>ncurses</b>
    implementation was lightly adapted from the 4.4BSD sources for a terminfo
    environment by Eric S. Raymond &lt;esr@snark.thyrsus.com&gt;.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMPATIBILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#COMPATIBILITY">COMPATIBILITY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>@TSET@</b> utility has been provided for
    backward-compatibility with BSD environments (under most modern UNIXes,
    <b>/etc/inittab</b> and <i>getty</i>(1) can set <b>TERM</b> appropriately
    for each dial-up line; this obviates what was <b>@TSET@</b>'s most important
    use). This implementation behaves like 4.4BSD tset, with a few exceptions
    specified here.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-S</b> option of BSD tset no longer works; it prints an
    error message to stderr and dies. The <b>-s</b> option only sets
    <b>TERM</b>, not <b>TERMCAP</b>. Both of these changes are because the
    <b>TERMCAP</b> variable is no longer supported under terminfo-based
    <b>ncurses</b>, which makes <b>@TSET@ -S</b> useless (we made it die noisily
    rather than silently induce lossage).</p>
<p class="Pp">There was an undocumented 4.4BSD feature that invoking tset via a
    link named `TSET` (or via any other name beginning with an upper-case
    letter) set the terminal to use upper-case only. This feature has been
    omitted.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-A</b>, <b>-E</b>, <b>-h</b>, <b>-u</b> and <b>-v</b>
    options were deleted from the <b>@TSET@</b> utility in 4.4BSD. None of them
    were documented in 4.3BSD and all are of limited utility at best. The
    <b>-a</b>, <b>-d</b>, and <b>-p</b> options are similarly not documented or
    useful, but were retained as they appear to be in widespread use. It is
    strongly recommended that any usage of these three options be changed to use
    the <b>-m</b> option instead. The <b>-n</b> option remains, but has no
    effect. The <b>-adnp</b> options are therefore omitted from the usage
    summary above.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is still permissible to specify the <b>-e</b>, <b>-i</b>, and
    <b>-k</b> options without arguments, although it is strongly recommended
    that such usage be fixed to explicitly specify the character.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of 4.4BSD, executing <b>@TSET@</b> as <b>reset</b> no longer
    implies the <b>-Q</b> option. Also, the interaction between the - option and
    the <i>terminal</i> argument in some historic implementations of
    <b>@TSET@</b> has been removed.</p>
