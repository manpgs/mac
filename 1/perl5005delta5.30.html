<p class="Pp">Perl is now developed on two tracks: a maintenance track that
    makes small, safe updates to released production versions with emphasis on
    compatibility; and a development track that pursues more aggressive
    evolution. Maintenance releases (which should be considered production
    quality) have subversion numbers that run from <span class="Li">1</span> to
    <span class="Li">49</span>, and development releases (which should be
    considered &quot;alpha&quot; quality) run from <span class="Li">50</span> to
    <span class="Li">99</span>.</p>

    development scheme.</p>

<h2 class="Ss">WARNING: This version is not binary compatible with Perl
  5.004.</h2>
<p class="Pp">Starting with Perl 5.004_50 there were many deep and far-reaching
    changes to the language internals. If you have dynamically loaded extensions
    that you built under perl 5.003 or 5.004, you can continue to use them with
    5.004, but you will need to rebuild and reinstall those extensions to use
    them 5.005. See <i>INSTALL</i> for detailed instructions on how to
  upgrade.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Default_installation_structure_has_changed"><a class="permalink" href="#Default_installation_structure_has_changed">Default
  installation structure has changed</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The new Configure defaults are designed to allow a smooth upgrade
    from 5.004 to 5.005, but you should read <i>INSTALL</i> for a detailed
    discussion of the changes in order to adapt them to your system.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Perl_Source_Compatibility"><a class="permalink" href="#Perl_Source_Compatibility">Perl
  Source Compatibility</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When none of the experimental features are enabled, there should
    be very few user-visible Perl source compatibility issues.</p>
<p class="Pp">If threads are enabled, then some caveats apply.
    <span class="Li">@_</span> and <span class="Li">$_</span> become lexical
    variables. The effect of this should be largely transparent to the user, but
    there are some boundary conditions under which user will need to be aware of
    the issues. For example, <span class="Li">&quot;local(@_)&quot;</span>
    results in a &quot;Can't localize lexical variable
    <span class="Li">@_</span> ...&quot; message. This may be enabled in a
    future version.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some new keywords have been introduced. These are generally
    expected to have very little impact on compatibility. See &quot;New
    <span class="Li">&quot;INIT&quot;</span> keyword&quot;, &quot;New
    <span class="Li">&quot;lock&quot;</span> keyword&quot;, and &quot;New
    <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span> operator&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Certain barewords are now reserved. Use of these will provoke a
    warning if you have asked for them with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-w&quot;</span> switch. See
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span> is now a reserved
  word&quot;.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="C_Source_Compatibility"><a class="permalink" href="#C_Source_Compatibility">C
  Source Compatibility</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There have been a large number of changes in the internals to
    support the new features in this release.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Core sources now require ANSI C compiler
    <p class="Pp">An ANSI C compiler is now <b>required</b> to build perl. See
        <i>INSTALL</i>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>All Perl global variables must now be referenced with an explicit prefix
    <p class="Pp">All Perl global variables that are visible for use by
        extensions now have a <span class="Li">&quot;PL_&quot;</span> prefix.
        New extensions should <span class="Li">&quot;not&quot;</span> refer to
        perl globals by their unqualified names. To preserve sanity, we provide
        limited backward compatibility for globals that are being widely used
        like <span class="Li">&quot;sv_undef&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;na&quot;</span> (which should now be written as
        <span class="Li">&quot;PL_sv_undef&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;PL_na&quot;</span> etc.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you find that your XS extension does not compile anymore
        because a perl global is not visible, try adding a
        <span class="Li">&quot;PL_&quot;</span> prefix to the global and
        rebuild.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is strongly recommended that all functions in the Perl API
        that don't begin with <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span> be
        referenced with a <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_&quot;</span> prefix. The
        bare function names without the
        <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_&quot;</span> prefix are supported with
        macros, but this support may cease in a future release.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See perlapi.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Enabling threads has source compatibility issues
    <p class="Pp">Perl built with threading enabled requires extensions to use
        the new <span class="Li">&quot;dTHR&quot;</span> macro to initialize the
        handle to access per-thread data. If you see a compiler error that talks
        about the variable <span class="Li">&quot;thr&quot;</span> not being
        declared (when building a module that has XS code), you need to add
        <span class="Li">&quot;dTHR;&quot;</span> at the beginning of the block
        that elicited the error.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The API function
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl_get_sv(&quot;@&quot;,GV_ADD)&quot;</span>
        should be used instead of directly accessing perl globals as
        <span class="Li">&quot;GvSV(errgv)&quot;</span>. The API call is
        backward compatible with existing perls and provides source
        compatibility with threading is enabled.</p>

      information.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Binary_Compatibility"><a class="permalink" href="#Binary_Compatibility">Binary
  Compatibility</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">This version is NOT binary compatible with older versions. All
    extensions will need to be recompiled. Further binaries built with threads
    enabled are incompatible with binaries built without. This should largely be
    transparent to the user, as all binary incompatible configurations have
    their own unique architecture name, and extension binaries get installed at
    unique locations. This allows coexistence of several configurations in the
    same directory hierarchy. See <i>INSTALL</i>.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Security_fixes_may_affect_compatibility"><a class="permalink" href="#Security_fixes_may_affect_compatibility">Security
  fixes may affect compatibility</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A few taint leaks and taint omissions have been corrected. This
    may lead to &quot;failure&quot; of scripts that used to work with older
    versions. Compiling with -DINCOMPLETE_TAINTS provides a perl with minimal
    amounts of changes to the tainting behavior. But note that the resulting
    perl will have known insecurities.</p>

<p class="Pp">Perl has a new Social Contract for contributors. See

<p class="Pp">The license included in much of the Perl documentation has
    changed. Most of the Perl documentation was previously under the implicit
    GNU General Public License or the Artistic License (at the user's choice).
    Now much of the documentation unambiguously states the terms under which it
    may be distributed. Those terms are in general much less restrictive than
    the GNU GPL. See perl and the individual perl manpages listed therein.</p>

<p class="Pp">WARNING: Threading is considered an <b>experimental</b> feature.
    Details of the implementation may change without notice. There are known

<h2 class="Ss" id="Compiler"><a class="permalink" href="#Compiler">Compiler</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">WARNING: The Compiler and related tools are considered
    <b>experimental</b>. Features may change without notice, and there are known
    limitations and bugs. Since the compiler is fully external to perl, the
    default configuration will build and install it.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Compiler produces three different types of transformations of
    a perl program. The C backend generates C code that captures perl's state
    just before execution begins. It eliminates the compile-time overheads of
    the regular perl interpreter, but the run-time performance remains
    comparatively the same. The CC backend generates optimized C code equivalent
    to the code path at run-time. The CC backend has greater potential for big
    optimizations, but only a few optimizations are implemented currently. The
    Bytecode backend generates a platform independent bytecode representation of
    the interpreter's state just before execution. Thus, the Bytecode back end
    also eliminates much of the compilation overhead of the interpreter.</p>
<p class="Pp">The compiler comes with several valuable utilities.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;B::Lint&quot;</span> is an experimental
    module to detect and warn about suspicious code, especially the cases that
    the <span class="Li">&quot;-w&quot;</span> switch does not detect.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;B::Deparse&quot;</span> can be used to
    demystify perl code, and understand how perl optimizes certain
  constructs.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;B::Xref&quot;</span> generates cross
    reference reports of all definition and use of variables, subroutines and
    formats in a program.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;B::Showlex&quot;</span> show the lexical
    variables used by a subroutine or file at a glance.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;perlcc&quot;</span> is a simple frontend
    for compiling perl.</p>

    The new <b>qsort()</b> is resistant to inconsistent comparison functions, so

<p class="Pp">The internals now reallocate the perl stack only at predictable
    times. In particular, magic calls never trigger reallocations of the stack,
    because all reentrancy of the runtime is handled using a &quot;stack of
    stacks&quot;. This should improve reliability of cached stack pointers in

<h2 class="Ss" id="More_generous_treatment_of_carriage_returns"><a class="permalink" href="#More_generous_treatment_of_carriage_returns">More
  generous treatment of carriage returns</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl used to complain if it encountered literal carriage returns
    in scripts. Now they are mostly treated like whitespace within program text.
    Inside string literals and here documents, literal carriage returns are
    ignored if they occur paired with linefeeds, or get interpreted as
    whitespace if they stand alone. This behavior means that literal carriage
    returns in files should be avoided. You can get the older, more compatible
    (but less generous) behavior by defining the preprocessor symbol
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_STRICT_CR&quot;</span> when building perl. Of
    course, all this has nothing whatever to do with how escapes like
    <span class="Li">&quot;\r&quot;</span> are handled within strings.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that this doesn't somehow magically allow you to keep all
    text files in DOS format. The generous treatment only applies to files that
    perl itself parses. If your C compiler doesn't allow carriage returns in
    files, you may still be unable to build modules that need a C compiler.</p>

    Starting with 5.005, the beginnings of experimental support for systems with
    32-bit long and 64-bit 'long long' integers has been added. If you add
    -DUSE_LONG_LONG to your ccflags in config.sh (or manually define it in
    perl.h) then perl will be built with 'long long' support. There will be many
    compiler warnings, and the resultant perl may not work on all systems. There
    are many other issues related to third-party extensions and libraries. This
    option exists to allow people to work on those issues.</p>

<p class="Pp">When you say something like <span class="Li">&quot;substr($x, 5) =
    &quot;hi&quot;&quot;</span>, the scalar returned by <b>substr()</b> is
    special, in that any modifications to it affect <span class="Li">$x</span>.
    (This is called a 'magic lvalue' because an 'lvalue' is something on the
    left side of an assignment.) Normally, this is exactly what you would expect
    to happen, but Perl uses the same magic if you use <b>substr()</b>,
    <b>pos()</b>, or <b>vec()</b> in a context where they might be modified,
    like taking a reference with <span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span> or as an
    argument to a sub that modifies <span class="Li">@_</span>. In previous
    versions, this 'magic' only went one way, but now changes to the scalar the
    magic refers to ($x in the above example) affect the magic lvalue too. For
    instance, this code now acts differently:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $x = &quot;hello&quot;;
    sub printit {
        $x = &quot;g'bye&quot;;

    in variable %s of type %s</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to access a field of a typed variable where the type does
      not know about the field name. The field names are looked up in the
      <span class="Li">%FIELDS</span> hash in the type package at compile time.
      The <span class="Li">%FIELDS</span> hash is usually set up with the
      'fields' pragma.</dd>
  <dt id="Out"><a class="permalink" href="#Out">Out of memory during
    ridiculously large request</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) You can't allocate more than 2^31+&quot;small amount&quot; bytes. This
      error is most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program. e.g.,
      <span class="Li">$arr[time]</span> instead of
      <span class="Li">$arr[$time]</span>.</dd>
  <dt id="Range"><a class="permalink" href="#Range">Range iterator outside
    integer range</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) One (or both) of the numeric arguments to the range operator
      &quot;..&quot; are outside the range which can be represented by integers
      internally. One possible workaround is to force Perl to use magical string
      increment by prepending &quot;0&quot; to your numbers.</dd>
  <dt id="Recursive"><a class="permalink" href="#Recursive">Recursive
    inheritance detected while looking for method '%s' %s</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) More than 100 levels of inheritance were encountered while invoking a
      method. Probably indicates an unintended loop in your inheritance
      hierarchy.</dd>
  <dt id="Reference"><a class="permalink" href="#Reference">Reference found
    where even-sized list expected</a></dt>
  <dd>(W) You gave a single reference where Perl was expecting a list with an
      even number of elements (for assignment to a hash). This usually means
      that you used the anon hash constructor when you meant to use parens. In
      any case, a hash requires key/value <b>pairs</b>.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    %hash = { one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, };   # WRONG
    %hash = [ qw/ an anon array / ];   # WRONG
    %hash = ( one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, );   # right
    %hash = qw( one 1 two 2 );                 # also fine
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Undefined"><a class="permalink" href="#Undefined">Undefined value
    assigned to typeglob</a></dt>
  <dd>(W) An undefined value was assigned to a typeglob, a la
      <span class="Li">&quot;*foo = undef&quot;</span>. This does nothing. It's
      possible that you really mean <span class="Li">&quot;undef
      *foo&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt id="Use"><a class="permalink" href="#Use">Use of reserved word
    &quot;%s&quot; is deprecated</a></dt>
  <dd>(D) The indicated bareword is a reserved word. Future versions of perl may
      use it as a keyword, so you're better off either explicitly quoting the
      word in a manner appropriate for its context of use, or using a different
      name altogether. The warning can be suppressed for subroutine names by
      either adding a <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span> prefix, or using
      a package qualifier, e.g. <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;our()&quot;</span>,
      or <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::our()&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt id="perl:"><a class="permalink" href="#perl:">perl: warning: Setting
    locale failed.</a></dt>
  <dd>(S) The whole warning message will look something like:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>       perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
       perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
               LC_ALL = &quot;En_US&quot;,
               LANG = (unset)
           are supported and installed on your system.
       perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (&quot;C&quot;).
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Exactly what were the failed locale settings varies. In the
        above the settings were that the LC_ALL was &quot;En_US&quot; and the
        LANG had no value. This error means that Perl detected that you and/or
        your system administrator have set up the so-called variable system but
        Perl could not use those settings. This was not dead serious,
        fortunately: there is a &quot;default locale&quot; called &quot;C&quot;
        that Perl can and will use, the script will be run. Before you really
        fix the problem, however, you will get the same error message each time
        you run Perl. How to really fix the problem can be found in &quot;LOCALE
        PROBLEMS&quot; in perllocale.</p>

  <dt id="regexp"><a class="permalink" href="#regexp">regexp too big</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) The current implementation of regular expressions uses shorts as
      address offsets within a string. Unfortunately this means that if the
      regular expression compiles to longer than 32767, it'll blow up. Usually
      when you want a regular expression this big, there is a better way to do
      it with multiple statements. See perlre.</dd>
