<p class="Pp">Manage multiple working trees attached to the same repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">A git repository can support multiple working trees, allowing you
    to check out more than one branch at a time. With <b>git worktree add</b> a
    new working tree is associated with the repository. This new working tree is
    called a &quot;linked working tree&quot; as opposed to the &quot;main
    working tree&quot; prepared by <b>git-init</b>(1) or <b>git-clone</b>(1). A
    repository has one main working tree (if it&#x2019;s not a bare repository)
    and zero or more linked working trees. When you are done with a linked
    working tree, remove it with <b>git worktree remove</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In its simplest form, <b>git worktree add &lt;path&gt;</b>
    automatically creates a new branch whose name is the final component of
    <b>&lt;path&gt;</b>, which is convenient if you plan to work on a new topic.
    For instance, <b>git worktree add ../hotfix</b> creates new branch
    <b>hotfix</b> and checks it out at path <b>../hotfix</b>. To instead work on
    an existing branch in a new working tree, use <b>git worktree add
    &lt;path&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</b>. On the other hand, if you just plan to make
    some experimental changes or do testing without disturbing existing
    development, it is often convenient to create a <i>throwaway</i> working
    tree not associated with any branch. For instance, <b>git worktree add -d
    &lt;path&gt;</b> creates a new working tree with a detached <b>HEAD</b> at
    the same commit as the current branch.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a working tree is deleted without using <b>git worktree
    remove</b>, then its associated administrative files, which reside in the
    repository (see &quot;DETAILS&quot; below), will eventually be removed
    automatically (see <b>gc.worktreePruneExpire</b> in <b>git-config</b>(1)),
    or you can run <b>git worktree prune</b> in the main or any linked working
    tree to clean up any stale administrative files.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a linked working tree is stored on a portable device or network
    share which is not always mounted, you can prevent its administrative files
    from being pruned by issuing the <b>git worktree lock</b> command,
    optionally specifying <b>--reason</b> to explain why the working tree is
    locked.</p>

<p class="Pp">add &lt;path&gt; [&lt;commit-ish&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Create <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> and checkout
  <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b> into it. The new working directory is linked to the
  current repository, sharing everything except working directory specific files
  such as <b>HEAD</b>, <b>index</b>, etc. As a convenience,
  <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b> may be a bare &quot;<b>-</b>&quot;, which is
  synonymous with <b>@{-1}</b>.
<p class="Pp">If <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b> is a branch name (call it
    <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>) and is not found, and neither <b>-b</b> nor <b>-B</b>
    nor <b>--detach</b> are used, but there does exist a tracking branch in
    exactly one remote (call it <b>&lt;remote&gt;</b>) with a matching name,
    treat as equivalent to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git worktree add --track -b &lt;branch&gt; &lt;path&gt; &lt;remote&gt;/&lt;branch&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If the branch exists in multiple remotes and one of them is named
    by the <b>checkout.defaultRemote</b> configuration variable, we&#x2019;ll
    use that one for the purposes of disambiguation, even if the
    <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> isn&#x2019;t unique across all remotes. Set it to e.g.
    <b>checkout.defaultRemote=origin</b> to always checkout remote branches from
    there if <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> is ambiguous but exists on the <b>origin</b>
    remote. See also <b>checkout.defaultRemote</b> in <b>git-config</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>&lt;commit-ish&gt;</b> is omitted and neither <b>-b</b> nor
    <b>-B</b> nor <b>--detach</b> used, then, as a convenience, the new working
    tree is associated with a branch (call it <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b>) named after
    <b>$(basename &lt;path&gt;)</b>. If <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> doesn&#x2019;t
    exist, a new branch based on <b>HEAD</b> is automatically created as if
    <b>-b &lt;branch&gt;</b> was given. If <b>&lt;branch&gt;</b> does exist, it
    will be checked out in the new working tree, if it&#x2019;s not checked out
    anywhere else, otherwise the command will refuse to create the working tree
    (unless <b>--force</b> is used).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">list</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">List details of each working tree. The main working tree
  is listed first, followed by each of the linked working trees. The output
  details include whether the working tree is bare, the revision currently
  checked out, the branch currently checked out (or &quot;detached HEAD&quot; if
  none), &quot;locked&quot; if the worktree is locked, &quot;prunable&quot; if
  the worktree can be pruned by <b>prune</b> command.</div>
<p class="Pp">lock</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If a working tree is on a portable device or network
  share which is not always mounted, lock it to prevent its administrative files
  from being pruned automatically. This also prevents it from being moved or
  deleted. Optionally, specify a reason for the lock with <b>--reason</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">move</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Move a working tree to a new location. Note that the main
  working tree or linked working trees containing submodules cannot be moved
  with this command. (The <b>git worktree repair</b> command, however, can
  reestablish the connection with linked working trees if you move the main
  working tree manually.)</div>
<p class="Pp">prune</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prune working tree information in
  <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">remove</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Remove a working tree. Only clean working trees (no
  untracked files and no modification in tracked files) can be removed. Unclean
  working trees or ones with submodules can be removed with <b>--force</b>. The
  main working tree cannot be removed.</div>
<p class="Pp">repair [&lt;path&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Repair working tree administrative files, if possible, if
  they have become corrupted or outdated due to external factors.
<p class="Pp">For instance, if the main working tree (or bare repository) is
    moved, linked working trees will be unable to locate it. Running
    <b>repair</b> in the main working tree will reestablish the connection from
    linked working trees back to the main working tree.</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, if a linked working tree is moved without using <b>git
    worktree move</b>, the main working tree (or bare repository) will be unable
    to locate it. Running <b>repair</b> within the recently-moved working tree
    will reestablish the connection. If multiple linked working trees are moved,
    running <b>repair</b> from any working tree with each tree&#x2019;s new
    <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> as an argument, will reestablish the connection to all
    the specified paths.</p>
<p class="Pp">If both the main working tree and linked working trees have been
    moved manually, then running <b>repair</b> in the main working tree and
    specifying the new <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> of each linked working tree will
    reestablish all connections in both directions.</p>

  some working tree but is missing (for instance, if <b>&lt;path&gt;</b> was
  deleted manually). This option overrides these safeguards. To add a missing
  but locked working tree path, specify <b>--force</b> twice.
<p class="Pp"><b>move</b> refuses to move a locked working tree unless
    <b>--force</b> is specified twice. If the destination is already assigned to
    some other working tree but is missing (for instance, if

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="REFS"><a class="permalink" href="#REFS">REFS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In multiple working trees, some refs may be shared between all
    working trees and some refs are local. One example is <b>HEAD</b> which is
    different for each working tree. This section is about the sharing rules and
    how to access refs of one working tree from another.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, all pseudo refs are per working tree and all refs
    starting with <b>refs/</b> are shared. Pseudo refs are ones like <b>HEAD</b>
    which are directly under <b>$GIT_DIR</b> instead of inside
    <b>$GIT_DIR/refs</b>. There are exceptions, however: refs inside
    <b>refs/bisect</b> and <b>refs/worktree</b> are not shared.</p>
<p class="Pp">Refs that are per working tree can still be accessed from another
    working tree via two special paths, <b>main-worktree</b> and
    <b>worktrees</b>. The former gives access to per-working tree refs of the
    main working tree, while the latter to all linked working trees.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, <b>main-worktree/HEAD</b> or
    <b>main-worktree/refs/bisect/good</b> resolve to the same value as the main
    working tree&#x2019;s <b>HEAD</b> and <b>refs/bisect/good</b> respectively.
    Similarly, <b>worktrees/foo/HEAD</b> or <b>worktrees/bar/refs/bisect/bad</b>
    are the same as <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/foo/HEAD</b> and
    <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/bar/refs/bisect/bad</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">To access refs, it&#x2019;s best not to look inside
    <b>$GIT_DIR</b> directly. Instead use commands such as
    <b>git-rev-parse</b>(1) or <b>git-update-ref</b>(1) which will handle refs
    correctly.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_FILE"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION_FILE">CONFIGURATION
  FILE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">By default, the repository <b>config</b> file is shared across all
    working trees. If the config variables <b>core.bare</b> or
    <b>core.worktree</b> are already present in the config file, they will be
    applied to the main working trees only.</p>
<p class="Pp">In order to have configuration specific to working trees, you can
    turn on the <b>worktreeConfig</b> extension, e.g.:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git config extensions.worktreeConfig true
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">In this mode, specific configuration stays in the path pointed by
    <b>git rev-parse --git-path config.worktree</b>. You can add or update
    configuration in this file with <b>git config --worktree</b>. Older Git
    versions will refuse to access repositories with this extension.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that in this file, the exception for <b>core.bare</b> and
    <b>core.worktree</b> is gone. If they exist in <b>$GIT_DIR/config</b>, you
    must move them to the <b>config.worktree</b> of the main working tree. You
    may also take this opportunity to review and move other configuration that
    you do not want to share to all working trees:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>core.worktree</b> and <b>core.bare</b> should
  never be shared</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>core.sparseCheckout</b> is recommended per
  working tree, unless you are sure you always use sparse checkout for all
  working trees.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DETAILS"><a class="permalink" href="#DETAILS">DETAILS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Each linked working tree has a private sub-directory in the
    repository&#x2019;s <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b> directory. The private
    sub-directory&#x2019;s name is usually the base name of the linked working
    tree&#x2019;s path, possibly appended with a number to make it unique. For
    example, when <b>$GIT_DIR=/path/main/.git</b> the command <b>git worktree
    add /path/other/test-next next</b> creates the linked working tree in
    <b>/path/other/test-next</b> and also creates a
    <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test-next</b> directory (or
    <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test-next1</b> if <b>test-next</b> is already
  taken).</p>
<p class="Pp">Within a linked working tree, <b>$GIT_DIR</b> is set to point to
    this private directory (e.g. <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next</b> in
    the example) and <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b> is set to point back to the main
    working tree&#x2019;s <b>$GIT_DIR</b> (e.g. <b>/path/main/.git</b>). These
    settings are made in a <b>.git</b> file located at the top directory of the
    linked working tree.</p>
<p class="Pp">Path resolution via <b>git rev-parse --git-path</b> uses either
    <b>$GIT_DIR</b> or <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b> depending on the path. For
    example, in the linked working tree <b>git rev-parse --git-path HEAD</b>
    returns <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/HEAD</b> (not
    <b>/path/other/test-next/.git/HEAD</b> or <b>/path/main/.git/HEAD</b>) while
    <b>git rev-parse --git-path refs/heads/master</b> uses
    <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b> and returns <b>/path/main/.git/refs/heads/master</b>,
    since refs are shared across all working trees, except <b>refs/bisect</b>
    and <b>refs/worktree</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">See <b>gitrepository-layout</b>(5) for more information. The rule
    of thumb is do not make any assumption about whether a path belongs to
    <b>$GIT_DIR</b> or <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b> when you need to directly access
    something inside <b>$GIT_DIR</b>. Use <b>git rev-parse --git-path</b> to get
    the final path.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you manually move a linked working tree, you need to update the
    <b>gitdir</b> file in the entry&#x2019;s directory. For example, if a linked
    working tree is moved to <b>/newpath/test-next</b> and its <b>.git</b> file
    points to <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next</b>, then update
    <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/gitdir</b> to reference
    <b>/newpath/test-next</b> instead. Better yet, run <b>git worktree
    repair</b> to reestablish the connection automatically.</p>
<p class="Pp">To prevent a <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b> entry from being pruned
    (which can be useful in some situations, such as when the entry&#x2019;s
    working tree is stored on a portable device), use the <b>git worktree
    lock</b> command, which adds a file named <b>locked</b> to the
    entry&#x2019;s directory. The file contains the reason in plain text. For
    example, if a linked working tree&#x2019;s <b>.git</b> file points to
    <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next</b> then a file named
    <b>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/locked</b> will prevent the
    <b>test-next</b> entry from being pruned. See <b>gitrepository-layout</b>(5)
    for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b> is enabled, the config file
    <b>.git/worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/config.worktree</b> is read after
    <b>.git/config</b> is.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="LIST_OUTPUT_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#LIST_OUTPUT_FORMAT">LIST
  OUTPUT FORMAT</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <b>worktree list</b> command has two output formats. The
    default format shows the details on a single line with columns. For
  example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git worktree list
/path/to/bare-source            (bare)
/path/to/linked-worktree        abcd1234 [master]
/path/to/other-linked-worktree  1234abc  (detached HEAD)
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The command also shows annotations for each working tree,
    according to its state. These annotations are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>locked</b>, if the working tree is
  locked.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>prunable</b>, if the working tree can be
  pruned via <b>git worktree prune</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git worktree list
/path/to/linked-worktree    abcd1234 [master]
/path/to/locked-worktreee   acbd5678 (brancha) locked
/path/to/prunable-worktree  5678abc  (detached HEAD) prunable
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">For these annotations, a reason might also be available and this
    can be seen using the verbose mode. The annotation is then moved to the next
    line indented followed by the additional information.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
$ git worktree list --verbose
/path/to/linked-worktree              abcd1234 [master]

        prunable: gitdir file points to non-existent location
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the annotation is moved to the next line if the
    additional information is available, otherwise it stays on the same line as
    the working tree itself.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Porcelain_Format"><a class="permalink" href="#Porcelain_Format">Porcelain
  Format</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The porcelain format has a line per attribute. Attributes are
    listed with a label and value separated by a single space. Boolean
    attributes (like <b>bare</b> and <b>detached</b>) are listed as a label
    only, and are present only if the value is true. Some attributes (like
    <b>locked</b>) can be listed as a label only or with a value depending upon
    whether a reason is available. The first attribute of a working tree is
    always <b>worktree</b>, an empty line indicates the end of the record. For
    example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>

    in and demands that you fix something immediately. You might typically use
    <b>git-stash</b>(1) to store your changes away temporarily, however, your
    working tree is in such a state of disarray (with new, moved, and removed
    files, and other bits and pieces strewn around) that you don&#x2019;t want
    to risk disturbing any of it. Instead, you create a temporary linked working
    tree to make the emergency fix, remove it when done, and then resume your
    earlier refactoring session.</p>
