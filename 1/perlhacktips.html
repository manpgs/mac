<p class="Pp">This document will help you learn the best way to go about hacking
    on the Perl core C code. It covers common problems, debugging, profiling,
    and more.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you haven't read perlhack and perlhacktut yet, you might want
    to do that first.</p>

<p class="Pp">Perl source plays by ANSI C89 rules: no C99 (or C++) extensions.
    You don't care about some particular platform having broken Perl? I hear
    there is still a strong demand for J2EE programmers.</p>

  environment problems</a></h2>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Not compiling with threading
    <p class="Pp">Compiling with threading (-Duseithreads) completely rewrites
        the function prototypes of Perl. You better try your changes with that.
        Related to this is the difference between &quot;Perl_-less&quot; and
        &quot;Perl_-ly&quot; APIs, for example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  Perl_sv_setiv(aTHX_ ...);
  sv_setiv(...);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The first one explicitly passes in the context, which is
        needed for e.g. threaded builds. The second one does that implicitly; do
        not get them mixed. If you are not passing in a aTHX_, you will need to
        do a dTHX as the first thing in the function.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See &quot;How multiple interpreters and concurrency are
        supported&quot; in perlguts for further discussion about context.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Not compiling with -DDEBUGGING
    <p class="Pp">The DEBUGGING define exposes more code to the compiler,
        therefore more ways for things to go wrong. You should try it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Introducing (non-read-only) globals
    <p class="Pp">Do not introduce any modifiable globals, truly global or file
        static. They are bad form and complicate multithreading and other forms
        of concurrency. The right way is to introduce them as new interpreter
        variables, see <i>intrpvar.h</i> (at the very end for binary
        compatibility).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Introducing read-only (const) globals is okay, as long as you
        verify with e.g. <span class="Li">&quot;nm libperl.a|egrep -v ' [TURtr]
        '&quot;</span> (if your <span class="Li">&quot;nm&quot;</span> has
        BSD-style output) that the data you added really is read-only. (If it
        is, it shouldn't show up in the output of that command.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you want to have static strings, make them constant:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  static const char etc[] = &quot;...&quot;;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If you want to have arrays of constant strings, note carefully
        the right combination of <span class="Li">&quot;const&quot;</span>s:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    static const char * const yippee[] =
        {&quot;hi&quot;, &quot;ho&quot;, &quot;silver&quot;};
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Not exporting your new function
    <p class="Pp">Some platforms (Win32, AIX, VMS, OS/2, to name a few) require
        any function that is part of the public API (the shared Perl library) to
        be explicitly marked as exported. See the discussion about
        <i>embed.pl</i> in perlguts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Exporting your new function
    <p class="Pp">The new shiny result of either genuine new functionality or
        your arduous refactoring is now ready and correctly exported. So what
        could possibly go wrong?</p>
    <p class="Pp">Maybe simply that your function did not need to be exported in
        the first place. Perl has a long and not so glorious history of
        exporting functions that it should not have.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the function is used only inside one source code file, make
        it static. See the discussion about <i>embed.pl</i> in perlguts.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the function is used across several files, but intended
        only for Perl's internal use (and this should be the common case), do
        not export it to the public API. See the discussion about
        <i>embed.pl</i> in perlguts.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Portability_problems"><a class="permalink" href="#Portability_problems">Portability
  problems</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The following are common causes of compilation and/or execution
    failures, not common to Perl as such. The C FAQ is good bedtime reading.
    Please test your changes with as many C compilers and platforms as possible;
    we will, anyway, and it's nice to save oneself from public
  embarrassment.</p>
<p class="Pp">If using gcc, you can add the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-std=c89&quot;</span> option which will hopefully
    catch most of these unportabilities. (However it might also catch
    incompatibilities in your system's header files.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Use the Configure
    <span class="Li">&quot;-Dgccansipedantic&quot;</span> flag to enable the gcc
    <span class="Li">&quot;-ansi</span> <span class="Li">-pedantic&quot;</span>
    flags which enforce stricter ANSI rules.</p>
<p class="Pp">If using the <span class="Li">&quot;gcc -Wall&quot;</span> note
    that not all the possible warnings (like
    <span class="Li">&quot;-Wuninitialized&quot;</span>) are given unless you
    also compile with <span class="Li">&quot;-O&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that if using gcc, starting from Perl 5.9.5 the Perl core
    source code files (the ones at the top level of the source code
    distribution, but not e.g. the extensions under ext/) are automatically
    compiled with as many as possible of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-std=c89&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;-ansi&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;-pedantic&quot;</span>, and a selection of
    <span class="Li">&quot;-W&quot;</span> flags (see cflags.SH).</p>
<p class="Pp">Also study perlport carefully to avoid any bad assumptions about
    the operating system, filesystems, character set, and so forth.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may once in a while try a &quot;make microperl&quot; to see
    whether we can still compile Perl with just the bare minimum of interfaces.
    (See README.micro.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Do not assume an operating system indicates a certain
  compiler.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Casting pointers to integers or casting integers to pointers
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    void castaway(U8* p)
    {
      IV i = p;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>    void castaway(U8* p)
    {
      IV i = (IV)p;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Both are bad, and broken, and unportable. Use the
        <b>PTR2IV()</b> macro that does it right. (Likewise, there are
        <b>PTR2UV()</b>, <b>PTR2NV()</b>, <b>INT2PTR()</b>, and
        <b>NUM2PTR()</b>.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>Casting between function pointers and data pointers
    <p class="Pp">Technically speaking casting between function pointers and
        data pointers is unportable and undefined, but practically speaking it
        seems to work, but you should use the <b>FPTR2DPTR()</b> and
        <b>DPTR2FPTR()</b> macros. Sometimes you can also play games with
        unions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Assuming sizeof(int) == sizeof(long)
    <p class="Pp">There are platforms where longs are 64 bits, and platforms
        where ints are 64 bits, and while we are out to shock you, even
        platforms where shorts are 64 bits. This is all legal according to the C
        standard. (In other words, &quot;long long&quot; is not a portable way
        to specify 64 bits, and &quot;long long&quot; is not even guaranteed to
        be any wider than &quot;long&quot;.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Instead, use the definitions IV, UV, IVSIZE, I32SIZE, and so
        forth. Avoid things like I32 because they are <b>not</b> guaranteed to
        be <i>exactly</i> 32 bits, they are <i>at least</i> 32 bits, nor are
        they guaranteed to be <b>int</b> or <b>long</b>. If you really
        explicitly need 64-bit variables, use I64 and U64, but only if guarded
        by HAS_QUAD.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Assuming one can dereference any type of pointer for any type of data
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  char *p = ...;
  long pony = *(long *)p;    /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Many platforms, quite rightly so, will give you a core dump
        instead of a pony if the p happens not to be correctly aligned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Lvalue casts
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  (int)*p = ...;    /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Simply not portable. Get your lvalue to be of the right type,
        or maybe use temporary variables, or dirty tricks with unions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Assume <b>anything</b> about structs (especially the ones you don't
      control, like the ones coming from the system headers)</li>
</ul>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>That a certain field exists in a struct</li>
  <li>That no other fields exist besides the ones you know of</li>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Assuming the character set is ASCIIish
    <p class="Pp">Perl can compile and run under EBCDIC platforms. See
        perlebcdic. This is transparent for the most part, but because the
        character sets differ, you shouldn't use numeric (decimal, octal, nor
        hex) constants to refer to characters. You can safely say
        <span class="Li">'A'</span>, but not <span class="Li">0x41</span>. You
        can safely say <span class="Li">'\n'</span>, but not
        <span class="Li">&quot;\012&quot;</span>. However, you can use macros
        defined in <i>utf8.h</i> to specify any code point portably.
        <span class="Li">&quot;LATIN1_TO_NATIVE(0xDF)&quot;</span> is going to
        be the code point that means LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S on whatever
        platform you are running on (on ASCII platforms it compiles without
        adding any extra code, so there is zero performance hit on those). The
        acceptable inputs to
        <span class="Li">&quot;LATIN1_TO_NATIVE&quot;</span> are from
        <span class="Li">0x00</span> through <span class="Li">0xFF</span>. If
        your input isn't guaranteed to be in that range, use
        <span class="Li">&quot;UNICODE_TO_NATIVE&quot;</span> instead.
        <span class="Li">&quot;NATIVE_TO_LATIN1&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;NATIVE_TO_UNICODE&quot;</span> translate the
        opposite direction.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you need the string representation of a character that
        doesn't have a mnemonic name in C, you should add it to the list in
        <i>regen/unicode_constants.pl</i>, and have Perl create
        <span class="Li">&quot;#define&quot;</span>'s for you, based on the
        current platform.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the
        <span class="Li">&quot;is</span><span class="Li"><i>FOO</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
        and
        <span class="Li">&quot;to</span><span class="Li"><i>FOO</i></span><span class="Li">&quot;</span>
        macros in <i>handy.h</i> work properly on native code points and
        strings.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also, the range 'A' - 'Z' in ASCII is an unbroken sequence of
        26 upper case alphabetic characters. That is not true in EBCDIC. Nor for
        'a' to 'z'. But '0' - '9' is an unbroken range in both systems. Don't
        assume anything about other ranges. (Note that special handling of
        ranges in regular expression patterns and transliterations makes it
        appear to Perl code that the aforementioned ranges are all
      unbroken.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Many of the comments in the existing code ignore the
        possibility of EBCDIC, and may be wrong therefore, even if the code
        works. This is actually a tribute to the successful transparent
        insertion of being able to handle EBCDIC without having to change
        pre-existing code.</p>
    <p class="Pp">UTF-8 and UTF-EBCDIC are two different encodings used to
        represent Unicode code points as sequences of bytes. Macros with the
        same names (but different definitions) in <i>utf8.h</i> and
        <i>utfebcdic.h</i> are used to allow the calling code to think that
        there is only one such encoding. This is almost always referred to as
        <span class="Li">&quot;utf8&quot;</span>, but it means the EBCDIC
        version as well. Again, comments in the code may well be wrong even if
        the code itself is right. For example, the concept of UTF-8
        <span class="Li">&quot;invariant</span>
        <span class="Li">characters&quot;</span> differs between ASCII and
        EBCDIC. On ASCII platforms, only characters that do not have the
        high-order bit set (i.e. whose ordinals are strict ASCII, 0 - 127) are
        invariant, and the documentation and comments in the code may assume
        that, often referring to something like, say,
        <span class="Li">&quot;hibit&quot;</span>. The situation differs and is
        not so simple on EBCDIC machines, but as long as the code itself uses
        the <span class="Li">&quot;NATIVE_IS_INVARIANT()&quot;</span> macro
        appropriately, it works, even if the comments are wrong.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As noted in &quot;TESTING&quot; in perlhack, when writing test
        scripts, the file <i>t/charset_tools.pl</i> contains some helpful
        functions for writing tests valid on both ASCII and EBCDIC platforms.
        Sometimes, though, a test can't use a function and it's inconvenient to
        have different test versions depending on the platform. There are 20
        code points that are the same in all 4 character sets currently
        recognized by Perl (the 3 EBCDIC code pages plus ISO 8859-1
        (ASCII/Latin1)). These can be used in such tests, though there is a
        small possibility that Perl will become available in yet another
        character set, breaking your test. All but one of these code points are
        C0 control characters. The most significant controls that are the same
        are <span class="Li">&quot;\0&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;\r&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{VT}&quot;</span> (also specifiable as
        <span class="Li">&quot;\cK&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;\x0B&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;\N{U+0B}&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;\013&quot;</span>). The single non-control is
        U+00B6 PILCROW SIGN. The controls that are the same have the same bit
        pattern in all 4 character sets, regardless of the UTF8ness of the
        string containing them. The bit pattern for U+B6 is the same in all 4
        for non-UTF8 strings, but differs in each when its containing string is
        UTF-8 encoded. The only other code points that have some sort of
        sameness across all 4 character sets are the pair 0xDC and 0xFC.
        Together these represent upper- and lowercase LATIN LETTER U WITH
        DIAERESIS, but which is upper and which is lower may be reversed: 0xDC
        is the capital in Latin1 and 0xFC is the small letter, while 0xFC is the
        capital in EBCDIC and 0xDC is the small one. This factoid may be
        exploited in writing case insensitive tests that are the same across all
        4 character sets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Assuming the character set is just ASCII
    <p class="Pp">ASCII is a 7 bit encoding, but bytes have 8 bits in them. The
        128 extra characters have different meanings depending on the locale.
        Absent a locale, currently these extra characters are generally
        considered to be unassigned, and this has presented some problems. This
        has being changed starting in 5.12 so that these characters can be
        considered to be Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Mixing #define and #ifdef
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  #define BURGLE(x) ... \
  #ifdef BURGLE_OLD_STYLE        /* BAD */
  ... do it the old way ... \
  #else
  ... do it the new way ... \
  #endif
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You cannot portably &quot;stack&quot; cpp directives. For
        example in the above you need two separate <b>BURGLE()</b> #defines, one
        for each #ifdef branch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Adding non-comment stuff after #endif or #else
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  #ifdef SNOSH
  ...
  #else !SNOSH    /* BAD */
  ...
  #endif SNOSH    /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The #endif and #else cannot portably have anything non-comment
        after them. If you want to document what is going (which is a good idea
        especially if the branches are long), use (C) comments:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  #ifdef SNOSH
  ...
  #else /* !SNOSH */
  ...
  #endif /* SNOSH */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The gcc option
        <span class="Li">&quot;-Wendif-labels&quot;</span> warns about the bad
        variant (by default on starting from Perl 5.9.4).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Having a comma after the last element of an enum list
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  enum color {
    CERULEAN,
    CHARTREUSE,
    CINNABAR,     /* BAD */
  };
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">is not portable. Leave out the last comma.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also note that whether enums are implicitly morphable to ints
        varies between compilers, you might need to (int).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Using //-comments
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  // This function bamfoodles the zorklator.   /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">That is C99 or C++. Perl is C89. Using the //-comments is
        silently allowed by many C compilers but cranking up the ANSI C89
        strictness (which we like to do) causes the compilation to fail.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Mixing declarations and code
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  void zorklator()
  {
    int n = 3;
    set_zorkmids(n);    /* BAD */
    int q = 4;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">That is C99 or C++. Some C compilers allow that, but you
        shouldn't.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The gcc option
        <span class="Li">&quot;-Wdeclaration-after-statement&quot;</span> scans
        for such problems (by default on starting from Perl 5.9.4).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Introducing variables inside <b>for()</b>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  for(int i = ...; ...; ...) {    /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">That is C99 or C++. While it would indeed be awfully nice to
        have that also in C89, to limit the scope of the loop variable, alas, we
        cannot.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Mixing signed char pointers with unsigned char pointers
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  int foo(char *s) { ... }
  ...
  unsigned char *t = ...; /* Or U8* t = ... */
  foo(t);   /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">While this is legal practice, it is certainly dubious, and
        downright fatal in at least one platform: for example VMS cc considers
        this a fatal error. One cause for people often making this mistake is
        that a &quot;naked char&quot; and therefore dereferencing a &quot;naked
        char pointer&quot; have an undefined signedness: it depends on the
        compiler and the flags of the compiler and the underlying platform
        whether the result is signed or unsigned. For this very same reason
        using a 'char' as an array index is bad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Macros that have string constants and their arguments as substrings of the
      string constants
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  #define FOO(n) printf(&quot;number = %d\n&quot;, n)    /* BAD */
  FOO(10);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Pre-ANSI semantics for that was equivalent to</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  printf(&quot;10umber = %d\10&quot;);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">which is probably not what you were expecting. Unfortunately
        at least one reasonably common and modern C compiler does &quot;real
        backward compatibility&quot; here, in AIX that is what still happens
        even though the rest of the AIX compiler is very happily C89.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Using printf formats for non-basic C types
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   IV i = ...;
   printf(&quot;i = %d\n&quot;, i);    /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">While this might by accident work in some platform (where IV
        happens to be an <span class="Li">&quot;int&quot;</span>), in general it
        cannot. IV might be something larger. Even worse the situation is with
        more specific types (defined by Perl's configuration step in
        <i>config.h</i>):</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   Uid_t who = ...;
   printf(&quot;who = %d\n&quot;, who);    /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The problem here is that Uid_t might be not only not
        <span class="Li">&quot;int&quot;</span>-wide but it might also be
        unsigned, in which case large uids would be printed as negative
      values.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There is no simple solution to this because of
        <b>printf()</b>'s limited intelligence, but for many types the right
        format is available as with either 'f' or '_f' suffix, for example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   IVdf /* IV in decimal */
   UVxf /* UV is hexadecimal */
   printf(&quot;i = %&quot;IVdf&quot;\n&quot;, i); /* The IVdf is a string constant. */
   Uid_t_f /* Uid_t in decimal */
   printf(&quot;who = %&quot;Uid_t_f&quot;\n&quot;, who);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Or you can try casting to a &quot;wide enough&quot; type:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   printf(&quot;i = %&quot;IVdf&quot;\n&quot;, (IV)something_very_small_and_signed);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">See &quot;Formatted Printing of Size_t and SSize_t&quot; in
        perlguts for how to print those.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Also remember that the <span class="Li">%p</span> format
        really does require a void pointer:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   U8* p = ...;
   printf(&quot;p = %p\n&quot;, (void*)p);
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The gcc option <span class="Li">&quot;-Wformat&quot;</span>
        scans for such problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Blindly using variadic macros
    <p class="Pp">gcc has had them for a while with its own syntax, and C99
        brought them with a standardized syntax. Don't use the former, and use
        the latter only if the HAS_C99_VARIADIC_MACROS is defined.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Blindly passing va_list
    <p class="Pp">Not all platforms support passing va_list to further varargs
        (stdarg) functions. The right thing to do is to copy the va_list using
        the <b>Perl_va_copy()</b> if the NEED_VA_COPY is defined.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Using gcc statement expressions
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>   val = ({...;...;...});    /* BAD */
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">While a nice extension, it's not portable. The Perl code does
        admittedly use them if available to gain some extra speed (essentially
        as a funky form of inlining), but you shouldn't.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Binding together several statements in a macro
    <p class="Pp">Use the macros STMT_START and STMT_END.</p>

  <li>Testing for operating systems or versions when should be testing for
      features
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  #ifdef __FOONIX__    /* BAD */
  foo = quux();
  #endif
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Unless you know with 100% certainty that <b>quux()</b> is only
        ever available for the &quot;Foonix&quot; operating system <b>and</b>
        that is available <b>and</b> correctly working for <b>all</b> past,
        present, <b>and</b> future versions of &quot;Foonix&quot;, the above is
        very wrong. This is more correct (though still not perfect, because the
        below is a compile-time check):</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  #ifdef HAS_QUUX
  foo = quux();
  #endif
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">How does the HAS_QUUX become defined where it needs to be?
        Well, if Foonix happens to be Unixy enough to be able to run the
        Configure script, and Configure has been taught about detecting and
        testing <b>quux()</b>, the HAS_QUUX will be correctly defined. In other
        platforms, the corresponding configuration step will hopefully do the
        same.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In a pinch, if you cannot wait for Configure to be educated,
        or if you have a good hunch of where <b>quux()</b> might be available,
        you can temporarily try the following:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>  #if (defined(__FOONIX__) || defined(__BARNIX__))
  # define HAS_QUUX
  #endif
  ...
  #ifdef HAS_QUUX
  foo = quux();
  #endif
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">But in any case, try to keep the features and operating
        systems separate.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A good resource on the predefined macros for various operating
        systems, compilers, and so forth is

  <li>Assuming the contents of static memory pointed to by the return values of
      Perl wrappers for C library functions doesn't change. Many C library
      functions return pointers to static storage that can be overwritten by
      subsequent calls to the same or related functions. Perl has light-weight
      wrappers for some of these functions, and which don't make copies of the
      static memory. A good example is the interface to the environment
      variables that are in effect for the program. Perl has
      <span class="Li">&quot;PerlEnv_getenv&quot;</span> to get values from the
      environment. But the return is a pointer to static memory in the C
      library. If you are using the value to immediately test for something,
      that's fine, but if you save the value and expect it to be unchanged by
      later processing, you would be wrong, but perhaps you wouldn't know it
      because different C library implementations behave differently, and the
      one on the platform you're testing on might work for your situation. But
      on some platforms, a subsequent call to
      <span class="Li">&quot;PerlEnv_getenv&quot;</span> or related function
      WILL overwrite the memory that your first call points to. This has led to
      some hard-to-debug problems. Do a &quot;savepv&quot; in perlapi to make a
      copy, thus avoiding these problems. You will have to free the copy when
      you're done to avoid memory leaks. If you don't have control over when it
      gets freed, you'll need to make the copy in a mortal scalar, like so:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre> if ((s = PerlEnv_getenv(&quot;foo&quot;) == NULL) {
    ... /* handle NULL case */
 }
 else {
     s = SvPVX(sv_2mortal(newSVpv(s, 0)));
 }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The above example works only if
        <span class="Li">&quot;s&quot;</span> is
        <span class="Li">&quot;NUL&quot;</span>-terminated; otherwise you have
        to pass its length to <span class="Li">&quot;newSVpv&quot;</span>.</p>

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Perl strings are NOT the same as C strings: They may contain
      <span class="Li">&quot;NUL&quot;</span> characters, whereas a C string is
      terminated by the first <span class="Li">&quot;NUL&quot;</span>. That is
      why Perl API functions that deal with strings generally take a pointer to
      the first byte and either a length or a pointer to the byte just beyond
      the final one.
    <p class="Pp">And this is the reason that many of the C library string
        handling functions should not be used. They don't cope with the full
        generality of Perl strings. It may be that your test cases don't have
        embedded <span class="Li">&quot;NUL&quot;</span>s, and so the tests
        pass, whereas there may well eventually arise real-world cases where
        they fail. A lesson here is to include
        <span class="Li">&quot;NUL&quot;</span>s in your tests. Now it's fairly
        rare in most real world cases to get
        <span class="Li">&quot;NUL&quot;</span>s, so your code may seem to work,
        until one day a <span class="Li">&quot;NUL&quot;</span> comes along.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here's an example. It used to be a common paradigm, for
        decades, in the perl core to use
        <span class="Li">&quot;strchr(&quot;list&quot;,&#x00A0;c)&quot;</span>
        to see if the character <span class="Li">&quot;c&quot;</span> is any of
        the ones given in <span class="Li">&quot;list&quot;</span>, a
        double-quote-enclosed string of the set of characters that we are seeing
        if <span class="Li">&quot;c&quot;</span> is one of. As long as
        <span class="Li">&quot;c&quot;</span> isn't a
        <span class="Li">&quot;NUL&quot;</span>, it works. But when
        <span class="Li">&quot;c&quot;</span> is a
        <span class="Li">&quot;NUL&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;strchr&quot;</span> returns a pointer to the
        terminating <span class="Li">&quot;NUL&quot;</span> in
        <span class="Li">&quot;list&quot;</span>. This likely will result in a
        segfault or a security issue when the caller uses that end pointer as
        the starting point to read from.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A solution to this and many similar issues is to use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;mem&quot;</span><i>-foo</i> C library functions
        instead. In this case <span class="Li">&quot;memchr&quot;</span> can be
        used to see if <span class="Li">&quot;c&quot;</span> is in
        <span class="Li">&quot;list&quot;</span> and works even if
        <span class="Li">&quot;c&quot;</span> is
        <span class="Li">&quot;NUL&quot;</span>. These functions need an
        additional parameter to give the string length. In the case of literal
        string parameters, perl has defined macros that calculate the length for
        you. See &quot;String Handling&quot; in perlapi.</p>

  <li><b>malloc</b>(0), <b>realloc</b>(0), calloc(0, 0) are non-portable. To be

<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Do not use <b>gets()</b>

  <li>Do not use <b>tmpfile()</b>

  <li>Do not use <b>strcpy()</b> or <b>strcat()</b> or <b>strncpy()</b> or
      <b>strncat()</b>
    <p class="Pp">Use <b>my_strlcpy()</b> and <b>my_strlcat()</b> instead: they
        either use the native implementation, or Perl's own implementation
        (borrowed from the public domain implementation of INN).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Do not use <b>sprintf()</b> or <b>vsprintf()</b>
    <p class="Pp">If you really want just plain byte strings, use
        <b>my_snprintf()</b> and <b>my_vsnprintf()</b> instead, which will try
        to use <b>snprintf()</b> and <b>vsnprintf()</b> if those safer APIs are
        available. If you want something fancier than a plain byte string, use
        <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_form&quot;</span>() or SVs and
        <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_sv_catpvf()&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that glibc <span class="Li">&quot;printf()&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf()&quot;</span>, etc. are buggy before
        glibc version 2.17. They won't allow a
        <span class="Li">&quot;%.s&quot;</span> format with a precision to
        create a string that isn't valid UTF-8 if the current underlying locale
        of the program is UTF-8. What happens is that the
        <span class="Li">%s</span> and its operand are simply skipped without
        any notice.

  </li>
  <li>Do not use <b>atoi()</b>
    <p class="Pp">Use <b>grok_atoUV()</b> instead. <b>atoi()</b> has ill-defined
        behavior on overflows, and cannot be used for incremental parsing. It is
        also affected by locale, which is bad.</p>

    more about what Perl is doing. But sometimes there is no alternative than to
    dive in with a debugger, either to see the stack trace of a core dump (very

<p class="Pp">To really poke around with Perl, you'll probably want to build
    Perl for debugging, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    ./Configure -d -DDEBUGGING
    make

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;-DDEBUGGING&quot;</span> turns on the C

    debugging information which will allow us to step through a running program,
    and to see in which C function we are at (without the debugging information
    we might see only the numerical addresses of the functions, which is not
    very helpful). It will also turn on the
    <span class="Li">&quot;DEBUGGING&quot;</span> compilation symbol which
    enables all the internal debugging code in Perl. There are a whole bunch of
    things you can debug with this: perlrun lists them all, and the best way to
    find out about them is to play about with them. The most useful options are
    probably</p>

                         SV *leftsv = TOPs; \
                         NV left = USE_LEFT(leftsv) ? SvNV(leftsv) : 0.0
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;POPn&quot;</span> takes the SV from the top
    of the stack and obtains its NV either directly (if
    <span class="Li">&quot;SvNOK&quot;</span> is set) or by calling the
    <span class="Li">&quot;sv_2nv&quot;</span> function.
    <span class="Li">&quot;TOPs&quot;</span> takes the next SV from the top of
    the stack - yes, <span class="Li">&quot;POPn&quot;</span> uses
    <span class="Li">&quot;TOPs&quot;</span> - but doesn't remove it. We then
    use <span class="Li">&quot;SvNV&quot;</span> to get the NV from
    <span class="Li">&quot;leftsv&quot;</span> in the same way as before - yes,
    <span class="Li">&quot;POPn&quot;</span> uses
    <span class="Li">&quot;SvNV&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since we don't have an NV for <span class="Li">$b</span>, we'll
    have to use <span class="Li">&quot;sv_2nv&quot;</span> to convert it. If we
    step again, we'll find ourselves there:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    (gdb) step
    Perl_sv_2nv (sv=0xa0675d0) at sv.c:1669
    1669        if (!sv)
    (gdb)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We can now use <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_sv_dump&quot;</span> to
    investigate the SV:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    (gdb) print Perl_sv_dump(sv)
    SV = PV(0xa057cc0) at 0xa0675d0
    REFCNT = 1

    PV = 0xa06a510 &quot;6XXXX&quot;\0
    CUR = 5
    LEN = 6
    $1 = void
</pre>
<p class="Pp">We know we're going to get <span class="Li">6</span> from this, so

<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;-ansi&quot;</span> (and its sidekick,

    always, but unfortunately they are not safe on all platforms, they can for

  DEBUGGERS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE 1</b>: Running under older memory debuggers such as
    Purify, valgrind or Third Degree greatly slows down the execution: seconds
    become minutes, minutes become hours. For example as of Perl 5.8.1, the
    ext/Encode/t/Unicode.t takes extraordinarily long to complete under e.g.
    Purify, Third Degree, and valgrind. Under valgrind it takes more than six
    hours, even on a snappy computer. The said test must be doing something that
    is quite unfriendly for memory debuggers. If you don't feel like waiting,
    that you can simply kill away the perl process. Roughly valgrind slows down
    execution by factor 10, AddressSanitizer by factor 2.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE 2</b>: To minimize the number of memory leak false alarms
    (see &quot;PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL&quot; for more information), you have to set
    the environment variable PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL to 2. For example, like
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 valgrind ./perl -Ilib ...
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE 3</b>: There are known memory leaks when there are
    compile-time errors within eval or require, seeing
    <span class="Li">&quot;S_doeval&quot;</span> in the call stack is a good
    sign of these. Fixing these leaks is non-trivial, unfortunately, but they
    must be fixed eventually.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="valgrind"><a class="permalink" href="#valgrind">valgrind</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The valgrind tool can be used to find out both memory leaks and
    illegal heap memory accesses. As of version 3.3.0, Valgrind only supports
    Linux on x86, x86-64 and PowerPC and Darwin (OS X) on x86 and x86-64. The
    special &quot;test.valgrind&quot; target can be used to run the tests under
    valgrind. Found errors and memory leaks are logged in files named
    <i>testfile.valgrind</i> and by default output is displayed inline.</p>
<p class="Pp">Example usage:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    make test.valgrind
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Since valgrind adds significant overhead, tests will take much
    longer to run. The valgrind tests support being run in parallel to help with
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    TEST_JOBS=9 make test.valgrind
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that the above two invocations will be very verbose as
    reachable memory and leak-checking is enabled by default. If you want to
    just see pure errors, try:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    VG_OPTS='-q --leak-check=no --show-reachable=no' TEST_JOBS=9 \
        make test.valgrind
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Valgrind also provides a cachegrind tool, invoked on perl as:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    VG_OPTS=--tool=cachegrind make test.valgrind
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As system libraries (most notably glibc) are also triggering
    errors, valgrind allows to suppress such errors using suppression files. The
    default suppression file that comes with valgrind already catches a lot of
    them. Some additional suppressions are defined in <i>t/perl.supp</i>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PROFILING"><a class="permalink" href="#PROFILING">PROFILING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Depending on your platform there are various ways of profiling
    Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are two commonly used techniques of profiling executables:
    <i>statistical time-sampling</i> and <i>basic-block counting</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first method takes periodically samples of the CPU program
    counter, and since the program counter can be correlated with the code
    generated for functions, we get a statistical view of in which functions the
    program is spending its time. The caveats are that very small/fast functions
    have lower probability of showing up in the profile, and that periodically
    interrupting the program (this is usually done rather frequently, in the
    scale of milliseconds) imposes an additional overhead that may skew the
    results. The first problem can be alleviated by running the code for longer
    (in general this is a good idea for profiling), the second problem is
    usually kept in guard by the profiling tools themselves.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second method divides up the generated code into <i>basic
    blocks</i>. Basic blocks are sections of code that are entered only in the
    beginning and exited only at the end. For example, a conditional jump starts
    a basic block. Basic block profiling usually works by <i>instrumenting</i>
    the code by adding <i>enter basic block #nnnn</i> book-keeping code to the
    generated code. During the execution of the code the basic block counters
    are then updated appropriately. The caveat is that the added extra code can
    skew the results: again, the profiling tools usually try to factor their own
    effects out of the results.</p>

<p class="Pp">To display the results you use the <i>gcov</i> utility (which
    should be installed if you have gcc 3.0 or newer installed). <i>gcov</i> is
    run on source code files, like this</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    gcov sv.c
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which will cause <i>sv.c.gcov</i> to be created. The <i>.gcov</i>
    files contain the source code annotated with relative frequencies of
    execution indicated by &quot;#&quot; markers. If you want to generate
    <i>.gcov</i> files for all profiled object files, you can run something like
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    for file in `find . -name \*.gcno`
    do sh -c &quot;cd `dirname $file` &amp;&amp; gcov `basename $file .gcno`&quot;
    done
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Useful options of <i>gcov</i> include
    <span class="Li">&quot;-b&quot;</span> which will summarise the basic block,
    branch, and function call coverage, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;-c&quot;</span> which instead of relative frequencies
    will use the actual counts. For more information on the use of <i>gcov</i>
    and basic block profiling with gcc, see the latest GNU CC manual. As of gcc
    4.8, this is at
    &lt;http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Gcov-Intro.html#Gcov-Intro&gt;</p>

<h2 class="Ss">PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL</h2>
<p class="Pp">If you want to run any of the tests yourself manually using e.g.
    valgrind, please note that by default perl <b>does not</b> explicitly
    cleanup all the memory it has allocated (such as global memory arenas) but
    instead lets the <b>exit()</b> of the whole program &quot;take care&quot; of
    such allocations, also known as &quot;global destruction of
  objects&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is a way to tell perl to do complete cleanup: set the
    environment variable PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL to a non-zero value. The t/TEST
    wrapper does set this to 2, and this is what you need to do too, if you
    don't want to see the &quot;global leaks&quot;: For example, for running
    under valgrind</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 valgrind ./perl -Ilib t/foo/bar.t
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(Note: the mod_perl apache module uses also this environment
    variable for its own purposes and extended its semantics. Refer to the
    mod_perl documentation for more information. Also, spawned threads do the
    equivalent of setting this variable to the value 1.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If, at the end of a run you get the message <i>N scalars
    leaked</i>, you can recompile with
    <span class="Li">&quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;</span>,
    (<span class="Li">&quot;Configure
    -Accflags=-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;</span>), which will cause the
    addresses of all those leaked SVs to be dumped along with details as to
    where each SV was originally allocated. This information is also displayed
    by Devel::Peek. Note that the extra details recorded with each SV increases
    memory usage, so it shouldn't be used in production environments. It also
    converts <span class="Li">&quot;new_SV()&quot;</span> from a macro into a
    real function, so you can use your favourite debugger to discover where
    those pesky SVs were allocated.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you see that you're leaking memory at runtime, but neither
    valgrind nor <span class="Li">&quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;</span>
    will find anything, you're probably leaking SVs that are still reachable and
    will be properly cleaned up during destruction of the interpreter. In such
    cases, using the <span class="Li">&quot;-Dm&quot;</span> switch can point
    you to the source of the leak. If the executable was built with
    <span class="Li">&quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;-Dm&quot;</span> will output SV allocations in
    addition to memory allocations. Each SV allocation has a distinct serial
    number that will be written on creation and destruction of the SV. So if
    you're executing the leaking code in a loop, you need to look for SVs that
    are created, but never destroyed between each cycle. If such an SV is found,
    set a conditional breakpoint within
    <span class="Li">&quot;new_SV()&quot;</span> and make it break only when
    <span class="Li">&quot;PL_sv_serial&quot;</span> is equal to the serial
    number of the leaking SV. Then you will catch the interpreter in exactly the
    state where the leaking SV is allocated, which is sufficient in many cases
    to find the source of the leak.</p>
<p class="Pp">As <span class="Li">&quot;-Dm&quot;</span> is using the PerlIO
    layer for output, it will by itself allocate quite a bunch of SVs, which are
    hidden to avoid recursion. You can bypass the PerlIO layer if you use the SV
    logging provided by <span class="Li">&quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG&quot;</span>
    instead.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">PERL_MEM_LOG</h2>
<p class="Pp">If compiled with
    <span class="Li">&quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG&quot;</span>
    (<span class="Li">&quot;-Accflags=-DPERL_MEM_LOG&quot;</span>), both memory
    and SV allocations go through logging functions, which is handy for
    breakpoint setting.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless <span class="Li">&quot;-DPERL_MEM_LOG_NOIMPL&quot;</span>
    (<span class="Li">&quot;-Accflags=-DPERL_MEM_LOG_NOIMPL&quot;</span>) is
    also compiled, the logging functions read
    <span class="Li">$ENV</span>{PERL_MEM_LOG} to determine whether to log the
    event, and if so how:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /m/           Log all memory ops
    $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /s/           Log all SV ops
    $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /t/           include timestamp in Log
    $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /^(\d+)/      write to FD given (default is 2)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Memory logging is somewhat similar to
    <span class="Li">&quot;-Dm&quot;</span> but is independent of
    <span class="Li">&quot;-DDEBUGGING&quot;</span>, and at a higher level; all
    uses of <b>Newx()</b>, <b>Renew()</b>, and <b>Safefree()</b> are logged with
    the caller's source code file and line number (and C function name, if
    supported by the C compiler). In contrast,
    <span class="Li">&quot;-Dm&quot;</span> is directly at the point of
    <span class="Li">&quot;malloc()&quot;</span>. SV logging is similar.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since the logging doesn't use PerlIO, all SV allocations are
    logged and no extra SV allocations are introduced by enabling the logging.
    If compiled with
    <span class="Li">&quot;-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS&quot;</span>, the serial
    number for each SV allocation is also logged.</p>

<h2 class="Ss">DDD over gdb</h2>
<p class="Pp">Those debugging perl with the DDD frontend over gdb may find the
    following useful:</p>
<p class="Pp">You can extend the data conversion shortcuts menu, so for example
    you can display an SV's IV value with one click, without doing any typing.
    To do that simply edit ~/.ddd/init file and add after:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  ! Display shortcuts.
  Ddd*gdbDisplayShortcuts: \
  /t ()   // Convert to Bin\n\
  /d ()   // Convert to Dec\n\
  /x ()   // Convert to Hex\n\
  /o ()   // Convert to Oct(\n\
</pre>
<p class="Pp">the following two lines:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  ((XPV*) (())-&gt;sv_any )-&gt;xpv_pv  // 2pvx\n\
  ((XPVIV*) (())-&gt;sv_any )-&gt;xiv_iv // 2ivx
</pre>
<p class="Pp">so now you can do ivx and pvx lookups or you can plug there the
    sv_peek &quot;conversion&quot;:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  Perl_sv_peek(my_perl, (SV*)()) // sv_peek
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(The my_perl is for threaded builds.) Just remember that every
    line, but the last one, should end with \n\</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively edit the init file interactively via: 3rd mouse
    button -&gt; New Display -&gt; Edit Menu</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: you can define up to 20 conversion shortcuts in the gdb
    section.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="C_backtrace"><a class="permalink" href="#C_backtrace">C
  backtrace</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">On some platforms Perl supports retrieving the C level backtrace
    (similar to what symbolic debuggers like gdb do).</p>
<p class="Pp">The backtrace returns the stack trace of the C call frames, with
    the symbol names (function names), the object names (like &quot;perl&quot;),
    and if it can, also the source code locations (file:line).</p>
<p class="Pp">The supported platforms are Linux, and OS X (some *BSD might work
    at least partly, but they have not yet been tested).</p>
<p class="Pp">This feature hasn't been tested with multiple threads, but it will
    only show the backtrace of the thread doing the backtracing.</p>
<p class="Pp">The feature needs to be enabled with
    <span class="Li">&quot;Configure -Dusecbacktrace&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;-Dusecbacktrace&quot;</span> also
    enables keeping the debug information when compiling/linking (often:
    <span class="Li">&quot;-g&quot;</span>). Many compilers/linkers do support
    having both optimization and keeping the debug information. The debug
    information is needed for the symbol names and the source locations.</p>
<p class="Pp">Static functions might not be visible for the backtrace.</p>
<p class="Pp">Source code locations, even if available, can often be missing or
    misleading if the compiler has e.g. inlined code. Optimizer can make
    matching the source code and the object code quite challenging.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="Linux"><a class="permalink" href="#Linux">Linux</a></dt>
  <dd>You <b>must</b> have the BFD (-lbfd) library installed, otherwise
      <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span> will fail to link. The BFD is
      usually distributed as part of the GNU binutils.
    <p class="Pp">Summary: <span class="Li">&quot;Configure ...
        -Dusecbacktrace&quot;</span> and you need
        <span class="Li">&quot;-lbfd&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="OS"><a class="permalink" href="#OS">OS X</a></dt>
  <dd>The source code locations are supported <b>only</b> if you have the
      Developer Tools installed. (BFD is <b>not</b> needed.)
    <p class="Pp">Summary: <span class="Li">&quot;Configure ...
        -Dusecbacktrace&quot;</span> and installing the Developer Tools would be
        good.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Optionally, for trying out the feature, you may want to enable
    automatic dumping of the backtrace just before a warning or croak (die)
    message is emitted, by adding
    <span class="Li">&quot;-Accflags=-DUSE_C_BACKTRACE_ON_ERROR&quot;</span> for
    Configure.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless the above additional feature is enabled, nothing about the
    backtrace functionality is visible, except for the Perl/XS level.</p>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, even if you have enabled this feature to be compiled,
    you need to enable it in runtime with an environment variable:
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_C_BACKTRACE_ON_ERROR=10&quot;</span>. It must be
    an integer higher than zero, telling the desired frame count.</p>
<p class="Pp">Retrieving the backtrace from Perl level (using for example an XS
    extension) would be much less exciting than one would hope: normally you
    would see <span class="Li">&quot;runops&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;entersub&quot;</span>, and not much else. This API is
    intended to be called <b>from within</b> the Perl implementation, not from
    Perl level execution.</p>
<p class="Pp">The C API for the backtrace is as follows:</p>

<p class="Pp">If you see in a debugger a memory area mysteriously full of

<h2 class="Ss" id="Read-only_optrees"><a class="permalink" href="#Read-only_optrees">Read-only
  optrees</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Under ithreads the optree is read only. If you want to enforce
    this, to check for write accesses from buggy code, compile with
    <span class="Li">&quot;-Accflags=-DPERL_DEBUG_READONLY_OPS&quot;</span> to
    enable code that allocates op memory via
    <span class="Li">&quot;mmap&quot;</span>, and sets it read-only when it is
    attached to a subroutine. Any write access to an op results in a
    <span class="Li">&quot;SIGBUS&quot;</span> and abort.</p>
<p class="Pp">This code is intended for development only, and may not be
    portable even to all Unix variants. Also, it is an 80% solution, in that it
    isn't able to make all ops read only. Specifically it does not apply to op
    slabs belonging to <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN&quot;</span> blocks.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, as an 80% solution it is still effective, as it has
    caught bugs in the past.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="When_is_a_bool_not_a_bool?"><a class="permalink" href="#When_is_a_bool_not_a_bool?">When
  is a bool not a bool?</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">On pre-C99 compilers, <span class="Li">&quot;bool&quot;</span> is
    defined as equivalent to <span class="Li">&quot;char&quot;</span>.
    Consequently assignment of any larger type to a
    <span class="Li">&quot;bool&quot;</span> is unsafe and may be truncated. The
    <span class="Li">&quot;cBOOL&quot;</span> macro exists to cast it correctly;
    you may also find that using it is shorter and clearer than writing out the
    equivalent conditional expression longhand.</p>
<p class="Pp">On those platforms and compilers where
    <span class="Li">&quot;bool&quot;</span> really is a boolean (C++, C99), it
    is easy to forget the cast. You can force
    <span class="Li">&quot;bool&quot;</span> to be a
    <span class="Li">&quot;char&quot;</span> by compiling with
    <span class="Li">&quot;-Accflags=-DPERL_BOOL_AS_CHAR&quot;</span>. You may
    also wish to run <span class="Li">&quot;Configure&quot;</span> with
    something like</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>    -Accflags='-Wconversion -Wno-sign-conversion -Wno-shorten-64-to-32'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or your compiler's equivalent to make it easier to spot any unsafe
    truncations that show up.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;TRUE&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;FALSE&quot;</span> macros are available for
    situations where using them would clarify intent. (But they always just mean
    the same as the integers 1 and 0 regardless, so using them isn't
