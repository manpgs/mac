<p class="Pp">Remove files matching pathspec from the index, or from the working
    tree and the index. <b>git rm</b> will not remove a file from just your
    working directory. (There is no option to remove a file only from the
    working tree and yet keep it in the index; use <b>/bin/rm</b> if you want to
    do that.) The files being removed have to be identical to the tip of the
    branch, and no updates to their contents can be staged in the index, though
    that default behavior can be overridden with the <b>-f</b> option. When
    <b>--cached</b> is given, the staged content has to match either the tip of
    the branch or the file on disk, allowing the file to be removed from just
    the index. When sparse-checkouts are in use (see
    <b>git-sparse-checkout</b>(1)), <b>git rm</b> will only remove paths within
    the sparse-checkout patterns.</p>

<p class="Pp">&lt;pathspec&gt;...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Files to remove. A leading directory name (e.g.
  <b>dir</b> to remove <b>dir/file1</b> and <b>dir/file2</b>) can be given to
  remove all files in the directory, and recursively all sub-directories, but
  this requires the <b>-r</b> option to be explicitly given.
<p class="Pp">The command removes only the paths that are known to Git.</p>
<p class="Pp">File globbing matches across directory boundaries. Thus, given two
    directories <b>d</b> and <b>d2</b>, there is a difference between using
    <b>git rm 'd*'</b> and <b>git rm 'd/*'</b>, as the former will also remove
    all of directory <b>d2</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For more details, see the <i>pathspec</i> entry in
    <b>gitglossary</b>(7).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-f, --force</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Override the up-to-date check.</div>

<div class="Bd-indent">Don&#x2019;t actually remove any file(s). Instead, just
  show if they exist in the index and would otherwise be removed by the

<p class="Pp">-r</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow recursive removal when a leading directory name is
  given.</div>
<p class="Pp">--</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option can be used to separate command-line options
  from the list of files, (useful when filenames might be mistaken for
  command-line options).</div>
<p class="Pp">--cached</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use this option to unstage and remove paths only from the
  index. Working tree files, whether modified or not, will be left alone.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-unmatch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Exit with a zero status even if no files matched.</div>
<p class="Pp">-q, --quiet</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><b>git rm</b> normally outputs one line (in the form of
  an <b>rm</b> command) for each file removed. This option suppresses that
  output.</div>

<div class="Bd-indent">Pathspec is passed in <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> instead of
  commandline args. If <b>&lt;file&gt;</b> is exactly <b>-</b> then standard
  input is used. Pathspec elements are separated by LF or CR/LF. Pathspec
  elements can be quoted as explained for the configuration variable
  <b>core.quotePath</b> (see <b>git-config</b>(1)). See also
  <b>--pathspec-file-nul</b> and global <b>--literal-pathspecs</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--pathspec-file-nul</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only meaningful with <b>--pathspec-from-file</b>.
  Pathspec elements are separated with NUL character and all other characters

  FILES THAT HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM THE FILESYSTEM</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">There is no option for <b>git rm</b> to remove from the index only
    the paths that have disappeared from the filesystem. However, depending on
    the use case, there are several ways that can be done.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Using &#x201C;git commit -a&#x201D;</h2>
<p class="Pp">If you intend that your next commit should record all
    modifications of tracked files in the working tree and record all removals
    of files that have been removed from the working tree with <b>rm</b> (as
    opposed to <b>git rm</b>), use <b>git commit -a</b>, as it will
    automatically notice and record all removals. You can also have a similar
    effect without committing by using <b>git add -u</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss">Using &#x201C;git add -A&#x201D;</h2>
<p class="Pp">When accepting a new code drop for a vendor branch, you probably
    want to record both the removal of paths and additions of new paths as well
    as modifications of existing paths.</p>
<p class="Pp">Typically you would first remove all tracked files from the
    working tree using this command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git ls-files -z | xargs -0 rm -f
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">and then untar the new code in the working tree. Alternately you
    could <i>rsync</i> the changes into the working tree.</p>
<p class="Pp">After that, the easiest way to record all removals, additions, and
    modifications in the working tree is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git add -A
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">See <b>git-add</b>(1).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Other_ways"><a class="permalink" href="#Other_ways">Other
  ways</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If all you really want to do is to remove from the index the files
    that are no longer present in the working tree (perhaps because your working
    tree is dirty so that you cannot use <b>git commit -a</b>), use the
    following command:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=D -z | xargs -0 git rm --cached
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SUBMODULES"><a class="permalink" href="#SUBMODULES">SUBMODULES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Only submodules using a gitfile (which means they were cloned with
    a Git version 1.7.8 or newer) will be removed from the work tree, as their
    repository lives inside the .git directory of the superproject. If a
    submodule (or one of those nested inside it) still uses a .git directory,
    <b>git rm</b> will move the submodules git directory into the superprojects
    git directory to protect the submodule&#x2019;s history. If it exists the
    submodule.&lt;name&gt; section in the <b>gitmodules</b>(5) file will also be
    removed and that file will be staged (unless --cached or -n are used).</p>
<p class="Pp">A submodule is considered up to date when the HEAD is the same as
    recorded in the index, no tracked files are modified and no untracked files
    that aren&#x2019;t ignored are present in the submodules work tree. Ignored
    files are deemed expendable and won&#x2019;t stop a submodule&#x2019;s work
    tree from being removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you only want to remove the local checkout of a submodule from
    your work tree without committing the removal, use <b>git-submodule</b>(1)
    <b>deinit</b> instead. Also see <b>gitsubmodules</b>(7) for details on
    submodule removal.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>git rm Documentation/\*.txt</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Removes all <b>*.txt</b> files from the index that are
  under the <b>Documentation</b> directory and any of its subdirectories.
<p class="Pp">Note that the asterisk <b>*</b> is quoted from the shell in this
    example; this lets Git, and not the shell, expand the pathnames of files and
    subdirectories under the <b>Documentation/</b> directory.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git rm -f git-*.sh</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Because this example lets the shell expand the asterisk
  (i.e. you are listing the files explicitly), it does not remove
  <b>subdir/git-foo.sh</b>.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Each time a superproject update removes a populated submodule
    (e.g. when switching between commits before and after the removal) a stale
    submodule checkout will remain in the old location. Removing the old
    directory is only safe when it uses a gitfile, as otherwise the history of
    the submodule will be deleted too. This step will be obsolete when recursive
    submodule update has been implemented.</p>
