<p class="Pp">--group=&lt;type&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Group commits based on <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>. If no
  <b>--group</b> option is specified, the default is <b>author</b>.
  <b>&lt;type&gt;</b> is one of:

  author</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>committer</b>, commits are grouped by
  committer (the same as <b>-c</b>)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>trailer:&lt;field&gt;</b>, the
  <b>&lt;field&gt;</b> is interpreted as a case-insensitive commit message
  trailer (see <b>git-interpret-trailers</b>(1)). For example, if your project
  uses <b>Reviewed-by</b> trailers, you might want to see who has been reviewing
  with <b>git shortlog -ns --group=trailer:reviewed-by</b>.
<p class="Pp">Note that commits that do not include the trailer will not be
    counted. Likewise, commits with multiple trailers (e.g., multiple signoffs)
    may be counted more than once (but only once per unique trailer value in
    that commit).</p>
<p class="Pp">Shortlog will attempt to parse each trailer value as a <b>name
    &lt;email&gt;</b> identity. If successful, the mailmap is applied and the
    email is omitted unless the <b>--email</b> option is specified. If the value
    cannot be parsed as an identity, it will be taken literally and
  completely.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If <b>--group</b> is specified multiple times, commits are counted
    under each value (but again, only once per unique value in that commit). For
    example, <b>git shortlog --group=author --group=trailer:co-authored-by</b>
    counts both authors and co-authors.</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">Linewrap the output by wrapping each line at
  <b>width</b>. The first line of each entry is indented by <b>indent1</b>
  spaces, and the second and subsequent lines are indented by <b>indent2</b>
  spaces. <b>width</b>, <b>indent1</b>, and <b>indent2</b> default to 76, 6 and
  9 respectively.
<p class="Pp">If width is <b>0</b> (zero) then indent the lines of the output
    without wrapping them.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;revision range&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show only commits in the specified revision range. When
  no &lt;revision range&gt; is specified, it defaults to <b>HEAD</b> (i.e. the
  whole history leading to the current commit). <b>origin..HEAD</b> specifies
  all the commits reachable from the current commit (i.e. <b>HEAD</b>), but not
  from <b>origin</b>. For a complete list of ways to spell &lt;revision
  range&gt;, see the &quot;Specifying Ranges&quot; section of
  <b>gitrevisions</b>(7).</div>
<p class="Pp">[--] &lt;path&gt;...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Consider only commits that are enough to explain how the

  Limiting</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using
    the special notations explained in the description, additional commit
    limiting may be applied.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using more options generally further limits the output (e.g.
    <b>--since=&lt;date1&gt;</b> limits to commits newer than
    <b>&lt;date1&gt;</b>, and using it with <b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>
    further limits to commits whose log message has a line that matches
    <b>&lt;pattern&gt;</b>), unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting
    options, such as <b>--reverse</b>.</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">Show commits older than a specific date.</div>
<p class="Pp">--author=&lt;pattern&gt;, --committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer
  header lines that match the specified pattern (regular expression). With more
  than one <b>--author=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>, commits whose author matches any of
  the given patterns are chosen (similarly for multiple
  <b>--committer=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>).</div>
<p class="Pp">--grep-reflog=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that
  match the specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
  <b>--grep-reflog</b>, commits whose reflog message matches any of the given
  patterns are chosen. It is an error to use this option unless
  <b>--walk-reflogs</b> is in use.</div>
<p class="Pp">--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the commits output to ones with log message that
  matches the specified pattern (regular expression). With more than one
  <b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>, commits whose message matches any of the given
  patterns are chosen (but see <b>--all-match</b>).
<p class="Pp">When <b>--notes</b> is in effect, the message from the notes is
    matched as if it were part of the log message.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--all-match</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the commits output to ones that match all given
  <b>--grep</b>, instead of ones that match at least one.</div>
<p class="Pp">--invert-grep</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the commits output to ones with log message that do
  not match the pattern specified with <b>--grep=&lt;pattern&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-i, --regexp-ignore-case</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Match the regular expression limiting patterns without
  regard to letter case.</div>
<p class="Pp">--basic-regexp</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Consider the limiting patterns to be basic regular
  expressions; this is the default.</div>
<p class="Pp">-E, --extended-regexp</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular
  expressions instead of the default basic regular expressions.</div>
<p class="Pp">-F, --fixed-strings</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings
  (don&#x2019;t interpret pattern as a regular expression).</div>
<p class="Pp">-P, --perl-regexp</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Consider the limiting patterns to be Perl-compatible
  regular expressions.
<p class="Pp">Support for these types of regular expressions is an optional
    compile-time dependency. If Git wasn&#x2019;t compiled with support for them
    providing this option will cause it to die.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--remove-empty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Stop when a given path disappears from the tree.</div>
<p class="Pp">--merges</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print only merge commits. This is exactly the same as
  <b>--min-parents=2</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-merges</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not print commits with more than one parent. This is
  exactly the same as <b>--max-parents=1</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--min-parents=&lt;number&gt;, --max-parents=&lt;number&gt;,
    --no-min-parents, --no-max-parents</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that
  many parent commits. In particular, <b>--max-parents=1</b> is the same as
  <b>--no-merges</b>, <b>--min-parents=2</b> is the same as <b>--merges</b>.
  <b>--max-parents=0</b> gives all root commits and <b>--min-parents=3</b> all
  octopus merges.
<p class="Pp"><b>--no-min-parents</b> and <b>--no-max-parents</b> reset these
    limits (to no limit) again. Equivalent forms are <b>--min-parents=0</b> (any
    commit has 0 or more parents) and <b>--max-parents=-1</b> (negative numbers
    denote no upper limit).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--first-parent</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge
  commit. This option can give a better overview when viewing the evolution of a
  particular topic branch, because merges into a topic branch tend to be only
  about adjusting to updated upstream from time to time, and this option allows
  you to ignore the individual commits brought in to your history by such a
  merge.</div>
<p class="Pp">--not</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Reverses the meaning of the <i>^</i> prefix (or lack
  thereof) for all following revision specifiers, up to the next
  <b>--not</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--all</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/</b>, along with

<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/heads</b> are
  listed on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i>
  is given, limit branches to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks
  <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end is implied.</div>
<p class="Pp">--tags[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/tags</b> are listed
  on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i> is
  given, limit tags to ones matching given shell glob. If pattern lacks
  <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end is implied.</div>
<p class="Pp">--remotes[=&lt;pattern&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all the refs in <b>refs/remotes</b> are
  listed on the command line as <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. If <i>&lt;pattern&gt;</i>
  is given, limit remote-tracking branches to ones matching given shell glob. If
  pattern lacks <i>?</i>, <i>*</i>, or <i>[</i>, <i>/*</i> at the end is
  implied.</div>
<p class="Pp">--glob=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all the refs matching shell glob
  <i>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</i> are listed on the command line as
  <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i>. Leading <i>refs/</i>, is automatically prepended if

<p class="Pp">--exclude=&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not include refs matching <i>&lt;glob-pattern&gt;</i>
  that the next <b>--all</b>, <b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>,
  <b>--remotes</b>, or <b>--glob</b> would otherwise consider. Repetitions of
  this option accumulate exclusion patterns up to the next <b>--all</b>,
  <b>--branches</b>, <b>--tags</b>, <b>--remotes</b>, or <b>--glob</b> option
  (other options or arguments do not clear accumulated patterns).
<p class="Pp">The patterns given should not begin with <b>refs/heads</b>,
    <b>refs/tags</b>, or <b>refs/remotes</b> when applied to <b>--branches</b>,
    <b>--tags</b>, or <b>--remotes</b>, respectively, and they must begin with
    <b>refs/</b> when applied to <b>--glob</b> or <b>--all</b>. If a trailing
    <i>/*</i> is intended, it must be given explicitly.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--reflog</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all objects mentioned by reflogs are listed
  on the command line as <b>&lt;commit&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--alternate-refs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if all objects mentioned as ref tips of
  alternate repositories were listed on the command line. An alternate
  repository is any repository whose object directory is specified in
  <b>objects/info/alternates</b>. The set of included objects may be modified by
  <b>core.alternateRefsCommand</b>, etc. See <b>git-config</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">--single-worktree</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, all working trees will be examined by the
  following options when there are more than one (see <b>git-worktree</b>(1)):
  <b>--all</b>, <b>--reflog</b> and <b>--indexed-objects</b>. This option forces
  them to examine the current working tree only.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-missing</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Upon seeing an invalid object name in the input, pretend
  as if the bad input was not given.</div>
<p class="Pp">--bisect</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretend as if the bad bisection ref
  <b>refs/bisect/bad</b> was listed and as if it was followed by <b>--not</b>
  and the good bisection refs <b>refs/bisect/good-*</b> on the command
  line.</div>
<p class="Pp">--stdin</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to the <i>&lt;commit&gt;</i> listed on the
  command line, read them from the standard input. If a <b>--</b> separator is
  seen, stop reading commits and start reading paths to limit the result.</div>
<p class="Pp">--cherry-mark</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Like <b>--cherry-pick</b> (see below) but mark equivalent
  commits with <b>=</b> rather than omitting them, and inequivalent ones with
  <b>+</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--cherry-pick</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Omit any commit that introduces the same change as
  another commit on the &#x201C;other side&#x201D; when the set of commits are
  limited with symmetric difference.
<p class="Pp">For example, if you have two branches, <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, a
    usual way to list all commits on only one side of them is with
    <b>--left-right</b> (see the example below in the description of the
    <b>--left-right</b> option). However, it shows the commits that were
    cherry-picked from the other branch (for example, &#x201C;3rd on b&#x201D;
    may be cherry-picked from branch A). With this option, such pairs of commits
    are excluded from the output.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--left-only, --right-only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric
  difference, i.e. only those which would be marked <b>&lt;</b> resp.
  <b>&gt;</b> by <b>--left-right</b>.
<p class="Pp">For example, <b>--cherry-pick --right-only A...B</b> omits those
    commits from <b>B</b> which are in <b>A</b> or are patch-equivalent to a
    commit in <b>A</b>. In other words, this lists the <b>+</b> commits from
    <b>git cherry A B</b>. More precisely, <b>--cherry-pick --right-only
    --no-merges</b> gives the exact list.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--cherry</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A synonym for <b>--right-only --cherry-mark
  --no-merges</b>; useful to limit the output to the commits on our side and
  mark those that have been applied to the other side of a forked history with
  <b>git log --cherry upstream...mybranch</b>, similar to <b>git cherry upstream
  mybranch</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-g, --walk-reflogs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog
  entries from the most recent one to older ones. When this option is used you
  cannot specify commits to exclude (that is, <i>^commit</i>,
  <i>commit1..commit2</i>, and <i>commit1...commit2</i> notations cannot be
  used).
<p class="Pp">With <b>--pretty</b> format other than <b>oneline</b> and
    <b>reference</b> (for obvious reasons), this causes the output to have two
    extra lines of information taken from the reflog. The reflog designator in
    the output may be shown as <b>ref@{Nth}</b> (where <b>Nth</b> is the
    reverse-chronological index in the reflog) or as <b>ref@{timestamp}</b>
    (with the timestamp for that entry), depending on a few rules:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.If the starting point is specified as
  <b>ref@{Nth}</b>, show the index format.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.If the starting point was specified as
  <b>ref@{now}</b>, show the timestamp format.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.If neither was used, but <b>--date</b> was given on
  the command line, show the timestamp in the format requested by
  <b>--date</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.Otherwise, show the index format.</div>
<p class="Pp">Under <b>--pretty=oneline</b>, the commit message is prefixed with
    this information on the same line. This option cannot be combined with
    <b>--reverse</b>. See also <b>git-reflog</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">Under <b>--pretty=reference</b>, this information will not be
    shown at all.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--merge</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">After a failed merge, show refs that touch files having a
  conflict and don&#x2019;t exist on all heads to merge.</div>
<p class="Pp">--boundary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output excluded boundary commits. Boundary commits are
  prefixed with <b>-</b>.</div>

<h2 class="Ss" id="History_Simplification"><a class="permalink" href="#History_Simplification">History
  Simplification</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for
    example the commits modifying a particular &lt;path&gt;. But there are two
    parts of <i>History Simplification</i>, one part is selecting the commits
    and the other is how to do it, as there are various strategies to simplify
    the history.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following options select the commits to be shown:</p>
<p class="Pp">&lt;paths&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commits modifying the given &lt;paths&gt; are
  selected.</div>
<p class="Pp">--simplify-by-decoration</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commits that are referred by some branch or tag are
  selected.</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that extra commits can be shown to give a meaningful
  history.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following options affect the way the simplification is
    performed:</p>
<p class="Pp">Default mode</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Simplifies the history to the simplest history explaining
  the final state of the tree. Simplest because it prunes some side branches if
  the end result is the same (i.e. merging branches with the same content)</div>
<p class="Pp">--show-pulls</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Include all commits from the default mode, but also any
  merge commits that are not TREESAME to the first parent but are TREESAME to a
  later parent. This mode is helpful for showing the merge commits that
  &quot;first introduced&quot; a change to a branch.</div>
<p class="Pp">--full-history</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Same as the default mode, but does not prune some
  history.</div>
<p class="Pp">--dense</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only the selected commits are shown, plus some to have a
  meaningful history.</div>
<p class="Pp">--sparse</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">All commits in the simplified history are shown.</div>
<p class="Pp">--simplify-merges</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Additional option to <b>--full-history</b> to remove some
  needless merges from the resulting history, as there are no selected commits
  contributing to this merge.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ancestry-path</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When given a range of commits to display (e.g.
  <i>commit1..commit2</i> or <i>commit2 ^commit1</i>), only display commits that
  exist directly on the ancestry chain between the <i>commit1</i> and
  <i>commit2</i>, i.e. commits that are both descendants of <i>commit1</i>, and
  ancestors of <i>commit2</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">A more detailed explanation follows.</p>
<p class="Pp">Suppose you specified <b>foo</b> as the &lt;paths&gt;. We shall
    call commits that modify <b>foo</b> !TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME. (In a
    diff filtered for <b>foo</b>, they look different and equal,
  respectively.)</p>
<p class="Pp">In the following, we will always refer to the same example history
    to illustrate the differences between simplification settings. We assume
    that you are filtering for a file <b>foo</b> in this commit graph:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          .-A---M---N---O---P---Q

         \   /   /   /   /   /
          `-------------'   X
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">The horizontal line of history A---Q is taken to be the first
    parent of each merge. The commits are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>I</b> is the initial commit, in which
  <b>foo</b> exists with contents &#x201C;asdf&#x201D;, and a file <b>quux</b>
  exists with contents &#x201C;quux&#x201D;. Initial commits are compared to an
  empty tree, so <b>I</b> is !TREESAME.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;In <b>A</b>, <b>foo</b> contains just
  &#x201C;foo&#x201D;.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>B</b> contains the same change as <b>A</b>.
  Its merge <b>M</b> is trivial and hence TREESAME to all parents.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>C</b> does not change <b>foo</b>, but its
  merge <b>N</b> changes it to &#x201C;foobar&#x201D;, so it is not TREESAME to
  any parent.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>D</b> sets <b>foo</b> to &#x201C;baz&#x201D;.
  Its merge <b>O</b> combines the strings from <b>N</b> and <b>D</b> to
  &#x201C;foobarbaz&#x201D;; i.e., it is not TREESAME to any parent.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>E</b> changes <b>quux</b> to
  &#x201C;xyzzy&#x201D;, and its merge <b>P</b> combines the strings to
  &#x201C;quux xyzzy&#x201D;. <b>P</b> is TREESAME to <b>O</b>, but not to
  <b>E</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>X</b> is an independent root commit that added
  a new file <b>side</b>, and <b>Y</b> modified it. <b>Y</b> is TREESAME to

  TREESAME to <b>P</b>, but not to <b>Y</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>rev-list</b> walks backwards through history, including or
    excluding commits based on whether <b>--full-history</b> and/or parent
    rewriting (via <b>--parents</b> or <b>--children</b>) are used. The
    following settings are available.</p>
<p class="Pp">Default mode</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any
  parent (though this can be changed, see <b>--sparse</b> below). If the commit
  was a merge, and it was TREESAME to one parent, follow only that parent. (Even
  if there are several TREESAME parents, follow only one of them.) Otherwise,
  follow all parents.
<p class="Pp">This results in:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          .-A---N---O
         /     /   /
        I---------D
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is
    available, removed <b>B</b> from consideration entirely. <b>C</b> was
    considered via <b>N</b>, but is TREESAME. Root commits are compared to an
    empty tree, so <b>I</b> is !TREESAME.</p>
<p class="Pp">Parent/child relations are only visible with <b>--parents</b>, but
    that does not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we have shown
    the parent lines.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--full-history without parent rewriting</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This mode differs from the default in one point: always
  follow all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them. Even if
  more than one side of the merge has commits that are included, this does not
  imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we get
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        I  A  B  N  D  O  P  Q
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>M</b> was excluded because it is TREESAME to both parents.
    <b>E</b>, <b>C</b> and <b>B</b> were all walked, but only <b>B</b> was
    !TREESAME, so the others do not appear.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to
    talk about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so we show
    them disconnected.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--full-history with parent rewriting</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME
  (though this can be changed, see <b>--sparse</b> below).
<p class="Pp">Merges are always included. However, their parent list is
    rewritten: Along each parent, prune away commits that are not included
    themselves. This results in</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          .-A---M---N---O---P---Q
         /     /   /   /   /
        I     B   /   D   /
         \   /   /   /   /
          `-------------'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Compare to <b>--full-history</b> without rewriting above. Note
    that <b>E</b> was pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the parent list of
    P was rewritten to contain <b>E</b>'s parent <b>I</b>. The same happened for
    <b>C</b> and <b>N</b>, and <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b> and <b>Q</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME
    affects inclusion:</p>
<p class="Pp">--dense</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commits that are walked are included if they are not
  TREESAME to any parent.</div>
<p class="Pp">--sparse</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">All commits that are walked are included.
<p class="Pp">Note that without <b>--full-history</b>, this still simplifies
    merges: if one of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one, so the
    other sides of the merge are never walked.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--simplify-merges</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">First, build a history graph in the same way that
  <b>--full-history</b> with parent rewriting does (see above).
<p class="Pp">Then simplify each commit <b>C</b> to its replacement <b>C'</b> in
    the final history according to the following rules:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Set <b>C'</b> to <b>C</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Replace each parent <b>P</b> of <b>C'</b> with
  its simplification <b>P'</b>. In the process, drop parents that are ancestors
  of other parents or that are root commits TREESAME to an empty tree, and
  remove duplicates, but take care to never drop all parents that we are
  TREESAME to.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If after this parent rewriting, <b>C'</b> is a
  root or merge commit (has zero or &gt;1 parents), a boundary commit, or
  !TREESAME, it remains. Otherwise, it is replaced with its only parent.</div>
<p class="Pp">The effect of this is best shown by way of comparing to
    <b>--full-history</b> with parent rewriting. The example turns into:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          .-A---M---N---O
         /     /       /
        I     B       D
         \   /       /
          `---------'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note the major differences in <b>N</b>, <b>P</b>, and <b>Q</b>
    over <b>--full-history</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>N</b>'s parent list had <b>I</b> removed,
  because it is an ancestor of the other parent <b>M</b>. Still, <b>N</b>
  remained because it is !TREESAME.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>P</b>'s parent list similarly had <b>I</b>
  removed. <b>P</b> was then removed completely, because it had one parent and
  is TREESAME.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>Q</b>'s parent list had <b>Y</b> simplified to
  <b>X</b>. <b>X</b> was then removed, because it was a TREESAME root. <b>Q</b>
  was then removed completely, because it had one parent and is TREESAME.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">There is another simplification mode available:</p>
<p class="Pp">--ancestry-path</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the displayed commits to those directly on the
  ancestry chain between the &#x201C;from&#x201D; and &#x201C;to&#x201D; commits
  in the given commit range. I.e. only display commits that are ancestor of the
  &#x201C;to&#x201D; commit and descendants of the &#x201C;from&#x201D; commit.
<p class="Pp">As an example use case, consider the following commit history:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
            D---E-------F
           /     \       \
          B---C---G---H---I---J
         /                     \
        A-------K---------------L--M
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">A regular <i>D..M</i> computes the set of commits that are
    ancestors of <b>M</b>, but excludes the ones that are ancestors of <b>D</b>.
    This is useful to see what happened to the history leading to <b>M</b> since
    <b>D</b>, in the sense that &#x201C;what does <b>M</b> have that did not
    exist in <b>D</b>&#x201D;. The result in this example would be all the
    commits, except <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> (and <b>D</b> itself, of course).</p>
<p class="Pp">When we want to find out what commits in <b>M</b> are contaminated
    with the bug introduced by <b>D</b> and need fixing, however, we might want
    to view only the subset of <i>D..M</i> that are actually descendants of
    <b>D</b>, i.e. excluding <b>C</b> and <b>K</b>. This is exactly what the
    <b>--ancestry-path</b> option does. Applied to the <i>D..M</i> range, it
    results in:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
                E-------F
                 \       \
                  G---H---I---J
                               \
                                L--M
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Before discussing another option, <b>--show-pulls</b>, we need to
    create a new example history.</p>
<p class="Pp">A common problem users face when looking at simplified history is
    that a commit they know changed a file somehow does not appear in the
    file&#x2019;s simplified history. Let&#x2019;s demonstrate a new example and
    show how options such as <b>--full-history</b> and <b>--simplify-merges</b>
    works in that case:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          .-A---M-----C--N---O---P
         /     / \  \  \/   /   /
        I     B   \  R-'`-Z'   /
         \   /     \/         /
          \ /      /\        /
           `---X--'  `---Y--'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">For this example, suppose <b>I</b> created <b>file.txt</b> which
    was modified by <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>X</b> in different ways. The
    single-parent commits <b>C</b>, <b>Z</b>, and <b>Y</b> do not change
    <b>file.txt</b>. The merge commit <b>M</b> was created by resolving the
    merge conflict to include both changes from <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> and hence
    is not TREESAME to either. The merge commit <b>R</b>, however, was created
    by ignoring the contents of <b>file.txt</b> at <b>M</b> and taking only the
    contents of <b>file.txt</b> at <b>X</b>. Hence, <b>R</b> is TREESAME to
    <b>X</b> but not <b>M</b>. Finally, the natural merge resolution to create
    <b>N</b> is to take the contents of <b>file.txt</b> at <b>R</b>, so <b>N</b>
    is TREESAME to <b>R</b> but not <b>C</b>. The merge commits <b>O</b> and
    <b>P</b> are TREESAME to their first parents, but not to their second
    parents, <b>Z</b> and <b>Y</b> respectively.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using the default mode, <b>N</b> and <b>R</b> both have a
    TREESAME parent, so those edges are walked and the others are ignored. The
    resulting history graph is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        I---X
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">When using <b>--full-history</b>, Git walks every edge. This will
    discover the commits <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> and the merge <b>M</b>, but also
    will reveal the merge commits <b>O</b> and <b>P</b>. With parent rewriting,
    the resulting graph is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          .-A---M--------N---O---P
         /     / \  \  \/   /   /
        I     B   \  R-'`--'   /
         \   /     \/         /
          \ /      /\        /
           `---X--'  `------'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Here, the merge commits <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> contribute extra
    noise, as they did not actually contribute a change to <b>file.txt</b>. They
    only merged a topic that was based on an older version of <b>file.txt</b>.
    This is a common issue in repositories using a workflow where many
    contributors work in parallel and merge their topic branches along a single
    trunk: manu unrelated merges appear in the <b>--full-history</b>
  results.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using the <b>--simplify-merges</b> option, the commits
    <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> disappear from the results. This is because the
    rewritten second parents of <b>O</b> and <b>P</b> are reachable from their
    first parents. Those edges are removed and then the commits look like
    single-parent commits that are TREESAME to their parent. This also happens
    to the commit <b>N</b>, resulting in a history view as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          .-A---M--.
         /     /    \
        I     B      R
         \   /      /
          \ /      /
           `---X--'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">In this view, we see all of the important single-parent changes
    from <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>X</b>. We also see the carefully-resolved
    merge <b>M</b> and the not-so-carefully-resolved merge <b>R</b>. This is
    usually enough information to determine why the commits <b>A</b> and
    <b>B</b> &quot;disappeared&quot; from history in the default view. However,
    there are a few issues with this approach.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first issue is performance. Unlike any previous option, the
    <b>--simplify-merges</b> option requires walking the entire commit history
    before returning a single result. This can make the option difficult to use
    for very large repositories.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second issue is one of auditing. When many contributors are
    working on the same repository, it is important which merge commits
    introduced a change into an important branch. The problematic merge <b>R</b>
    above is not likely to be the merge commit that was used to merge into an
    important branch. Instead, the merge <b>N</b> was used to merge <b>R</b> and
    <b>X</b> into the important branch. This commit may have information about
    why the change <b>X</b> came to override the changes from <b>A</b> and
    <b>B</b> in its commit message.</p>
<p class="Pp">--show-pulls</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to the commits shown in the default history,
  show each merge commit that is not TREESAME to its first parent but is
  TREESAME to a later parent.
<p class="Pp">When a merge commit is included by <b>--show-pulls</b>, the merge
    is treated as if it &quot;pulled&quot; the change from another branch. When
    using <b>--show-pulls</b> on this example (and no other options) the
    resulting graph is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        I---X---R---N
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Here, the merge commits <b>R</b> and <b>N</b> are included because
    they pulled the commits <b>X</b> and <b>R</b> into the base branch,
    respectively. These merges are the reason the commits <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>
    do not appear in the default history.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>--show-pulls</b> is paired with <b>--simplify-merges</b>,
    the graph includes all of the necessary information:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
          .-A---M--.   N
         /     /    \ /
        I     B      R
         \   /      /
          \ /      /
           `---X--'
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Notice that since <b>M</b> is reachable from <b>R</b>, the edge
    from <b>N</b> to <b>M</b> was simplified away. However, <b>N</b> still
    appears in the history as an important commit because it &quot;pulled&quot;
    the change <b>R</b> into the main branch.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <b>--simplify-by-decoration</b> option allows you to view only
    the big picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits that are
    not referenced by tags. Commits are marked as !TREESAME (in other words,
    kept after history simplification rules described above) if (1) they are
    referenced by tags, or (2) they change the contents of the paths given on
    the command line. All other commits are marked as TREESAME (subject to be
    simplified away).</p>
