<p class="Pp">Perl 5.34.1 represents approximately 10 months of development
    since Perl 5.34.0 and contains approximately 4,600 lines of changes across
    60 files from 23 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 1,100 lines of changes to 18 .pm, .t, .c and .h
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.34.1:</p>
<p class="Pp">Andrew Fresh, Atsushi Sugawara, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dan Book,
    Hugo van der Sanden, James E Keenan, Karen Etheridge, Leon Timmermans,
    Matthew Horsfall, Max Maischein, Michiel Beijen, Neil Bowers, Nicolas R.,
    Paul Evans, Renee Baecker, Ricardo Signes, Richard Leach, Sawyer X, Sergey
    Poznyakoff, Steve Hay, Tomasz Konojacki, Tony Cook, Yves Orton.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
    please see the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.</p>
