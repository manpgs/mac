    The <code class="Nm">shlock</code> command is deprecated, and
    <a class="Xr" href="../1/lockf">lockf(1)</a> should be used instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">shlock</code> command can create or verify a
    lock file on behalf of a shell or other script program. When it attempts to
    create a lock file, if one already exists, <code class="Nm">shlock</code>
    verifies that it is or is not valid. If valid,
    <code class="Nm">shlock</code> will exit with a non-zero exit code. If
    invalid, <code class="Nm">shlock</code> will remove the lock file, and
    create a new one.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">shlock</code> uses the
    <a class="Xr" href="../2/link">link(2)</a> system call to make the final
    target lock file, which is an atomic operation (i.e. &quot;dot
    locking&quot;, so named for this mechanism's original use for locking system
    mailboxes). It puts the process ID (&quot;PID&quot;) from the command line
    into the requested lock file.</p>
<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">shlock</code> verifies that an extant lock file
    is still valid by using <a class="Xr" href="../2/kill">kill(2)</a> with a
    zero signal to check for the existence of the process that holds the
  lock.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fl">-d</code> option causes
    <code class="Nm">shlock</code> to be verbose about what it is doing.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fl">-f</code> argument with
    <var class="Ar">lockfile</var> is always required.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fl">-p</code> option with
    <var class="Ar">PID</var> is given when the program is to create a lock
    file; when absent, <code class="Nm">shlock</code> will simply check for the
    validity of the lock file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Fl">-u</code> option causes
    <code class="Nm">shlock</code> to read and write the PID as a binary pid_t,
    instead of as ASCII, to be compatible with the locks created by UUCP.</p>

<p class="Pp"><code class="Nm">shlock</code> was written for the first Network
    News Transfer Protocol (NNTP) software distribution, released in March 1986.
    The algorithm was suggested by Peter Honeyman, from work he did on
    HoneyDanBer UUCP.</p>

<p class="Pp">Does not work on NFS or other network file system on different
    systems because the disparate systems have disjoint PID spaces.</p>
<p class="Pp">Cannot handle the case where a lock file was not deleted, the
    process that created it has exited, and the system has created a new process
    with the same PID as in the dead lock file. The lock file will appear to be
    valid even though the process is unrelated to the one that created the lock
    in the first place. Always remove your lock files after you're done.</p>
