   The -*- nroff -*- definitions below are for supplemental macros used
   in Tcl/Tk manual entries.
  
   .AP type name in/out ?indent?
  	Start paragraph describing an argument to a library procedure.
  	type is type of argument (int, etc.), in/out is either "in", "out",
  	or "in/out" to describe whether procedure reads or modifies arg,
  	and indent is equivalent to second arg of .IP (shouldn't ever be
  	needed;  use .AS below instead)
  
   .AS ?type? ?name?
  	Give maximum sizes of arguments for setting tab stops.  Type and
  	name are examples of largest possible arguments that will be passed
  	to .AP later.  If args are omitted, default tab stops are used.
  
   .BS
  	Start box enclosure.  From here until next .BE, everything will be
  	enclosed in one large box.
  
   .BE
  	End of box enclosure.
  
   .CS
  	Begin code excerpt.
  
   .CE
  	End code excerpt.
  
   .VS ?version? ?br?
  	Begin vertical sidebar, for use in marking newly-changed parts
  	of man pages.  The first argument is ignored and used for recording
  	the version when the .VS was added, so that the sidebars can be
  	found and removed when they reach a certain age.  If another argument
  	is present, then a line break is forced before starting the sidebar.
  
   .VE
  	End of vertical sidebar.
  
   .DS
  	Begin an indented unfilled display.
  
   .DE
  	End of indented unfilled display.
  
   .SO ?manpage?
  	Start of list of standard options for a Tk widget. The manpage
  	argument defines where to look up the standard options; if
  	omitted, defaults to "options". The options follow on successive
  	lines, in three columns separated by tabs.
  
   .SE
  	End of list of standard options for a Tk widget.
  
   .OP cmdName dbName dbClass
  	Start of description of a specific option.  cmdName gives the
  	option's name as specified in the class command, dbName gives
  	the option's name in the option database, and dbClass gives
  	the option's class in the option database.
  
   .UL arg1 arg2
  	Print arg1 underlined, then print arg2 normally.
  
   .QW arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally (for trailing punctuation).
  
   .PQ arg1 ?arg2?
  	Print an open parenthesis, arg1 in quotes, then arg2 normally
  	(for trailing punctuation) and then a closing parenthesis.

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Wish</b> is a simple program consisting of the Tcl command
    language, the Tk toolkit, and a main program that reads commands from
    standard input or from a file. It creates a main window and then processes
    Tcl commands. If <b>wish</b> is invoked with arguments, then the first few
    arguments, ?<b>-encoding </b><i>name</i>? ?<i>fileName</i>? specify the name
    of a script file, and, optionally, the encoding of the text data stored in
    that script file. A value for <i>fileName</i> is recognized if the
    appropriate argument does not start with &#x201C;-&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="Pp">If there are no arguments, or the arguments do not specify a
    <i>fileName</i>, then wish reads Tcl commands interactively from standard
    input. It will continue processing commands until all windows have been
    deleted or until end-of-file is reached on standard input. If there exists a
    file &#x201C;<b>.wishrc</b>&#x201D; in the home directory of the user,
    <b>wish</b> evaluates the file as a Tcl script just before reading the first
    command from standard input.</p>
<p class="Pp">If arguments to <b>wish</b> do specify a <i>fileName</i>, then
    <i>fileName</i> is treated as the name of a script file. <b>Wish</b> will
    evaluate the script in <i>fileName</i> (which presumably creates a user
    interface), then it will respond to events until all windows have been
    deleted. Commands will not be read from standard input. There is no
    automatic evaluation of &#x201C;<b>.wishrc</b>&#x201D; when the name of a
    script file is presented on the <b>wish</b> command line, but the script
    file can always <b>source</b> it if desired.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that on Windows, the <b>wish</b><i>version</i><b>.exe</b>
    program varies from the <b>tclsh</b><i>version</i><b>.exe</b> program in an
    additional important way: it does not connect to a standard Windows console
    and is instead a windowed program. Because of this, it additionally provides
    access to its own <b>console</b> command.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTION_PROCESSING"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTION_PROCESSING">OPTION
  PROCESSING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Wish</b> automatically processes all of the command-line
    options described in the <b>OPTIONS</b> summary above. Any other
    command-line arguments besides these are passed through to the application
    using the <b>argc</b> and <b>argv</b> variables described later.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="APPLICATION_NAME_AND_CLASS"><a class="permalink" href="#APPLICATION_NAME_AND_CLASS">APPLICATION
  NAME AND CLASS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The name of the application, which is used for purposes such as
    <b>send</b> commands, is taken from the <b>-name</b> option, if it is
    specified; otherwise it is taken from <i>fileName</i>, if it is specified,
    or from the command name by which <b>wish</b> was invoked. In the last two
    cases, if the name contains a &#x201C;/&#x201D; character, then only the
    characters after the last slash are used as the application name.</p>
<p class="Pp">The class of the application, which is used for purposes such as
    specifying options with a <b>RESOURCE_MANAGER</b> property or .Xdefaults
    file, is the same as its name except that the first letter is
  capitalized.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="VARIABLES"><a class="permalink" href="#VARIABLES">VARIABLES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>Wish</b> sets the following Tcl variables:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="argc"><a class="permalink" href="#argc"><b>argc</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Contains a count of the number of <i>arg</i> arguments (0 if none), not
      including the options described above.</dd>
  <dt id="argv"><a class="permalink" href="#argv"><b>argv</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Contains a Tcl list whose elements are the <i>arg</i> arguments that
      follow a <b>--</b> option or do not match any of the options described in
      <b>OPTIONS</b> above, in order, or an empty string if there are no such
      arguments.</dd>
  <dt id="argv0"><a class="permalink" href="#argv0"><b>argv0</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Contains <i>fileName</i> if it was specified. Otherwise, contains the name
      by which <b>wish</b> was invoked.</dd>
  <dt id="geometry~2"><a class="permalink" href="#geometry~2"><b>geometry</b></a></dt>
  <dd>If the <b>-geometry</b> option is specified, <b>wish</b> copies its value
      into this variable. If the variable still exists after <i>fileName</i> has
      been evaluated, <b>wish</b> uses the value of the variable in a <b>wm
      geometry</b> command to set the main window's geometry.</dd>
  <dt id="tcl_interactive"><a class="permalink" href="#tcl_interactive"><b>tcl_interactive</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Contains 1 if <b>wish</b> is reading commands interactively
      (<i>fileName</i> was not specified and standard input is a terminal-like
      device), 0 otherwise.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SCRIPT_FILES"><a class="permalink" href="#SCRIPT_FILES">SCRIPT
  FILES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If you create a Tcl script in a file whose first line is</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>#!/usr/local/bin/wish</b></pre>
</div>
then you can invoke the script file directly from your shell if you mark it as
  executable. This assumes that <b>wish</b> has been installed in the default
  location in /usr/local/bin; if it is installed somewhere else then you will
  have to modify the above line to match. Many UNIX systems do not allow the
  <b>#!</b> line to exceed about 30 characters in length, so be sure that the
  <b>wish</b> executable can be accessed with a short file name.
<p class="Pp">An even better approach is to start your script files with the
    following three lines:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
<b>#!/bin/sh</b>
<b># the next line restarts using wish \</b>
<b>exec wish &quot;$0&quot; &quot;$@&quot;</b></pre>
</div>
This approach has three advantages over the approach in the previous paragraph.
  First, the location of the <b>wish</b> binary does not have to be hard-wired
  into the script: it can be anywhere in your shell search path. Second, it gets
  around the 30-character file name limit in the previous approach. Third, this
  approach will work even if <b>wish</b> is itself a shell script (this is done
  on some systems in order to handle multiple architectures or operating
  systems: the <b>wish</b> script selects one of several binaries to run). The
  three lines cause both <b>sh</b> and <b>wish</b> to process the script, but
  the <b>exec</b> is only executed by <b>sh</b>. <b>sh</b> processes the script
  first; it treats the second line as a comment and executes the third line. The
  <b>exec</b> statement cause the shell to stop processing and instead to start
  up <b>wish</b> to reprocess the entire script. When <b>wish</b> starts up, it
  treats all three lines as comments, since the backslash at the end of the
  second line causes the third line to be treated as part of the comment on the
  second line.
<p class="Pp">The end of a script file may be marked either by the physical end
    of the medium, or by the character, &#x201C;\032&#x201D;
    (&#x201C;\u001a&#x201D;, control-Z). If this character is present in the
    file, the <b>wish</b> application will read text up to but not including the
    character. An application that requires this character in the file may
    encode it as &#x201C;\032&#x201D;, &#x201C;\x1a&#x201D;, or
    &#x201C;\u001a&#x201D;; or may generate it by use of commands such as
    <b>format</b> or <b>binary</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="PROMPTS"><a class="permalink" href="#PROMPTS">PROMPTS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When <b>wish</b> is invoked interactively it normally prompts for
    each command with &#x201C;<b>% </b>&#x201D;. You can change the prompt by
    setting the variables <b>tcl_prompt1</b> and <b>tcl_prompt2</b>. If variable
    <b>tcl_prompt1</b> exists then it must consist of a Tcl script to output a
    prompt; instead of outputting a prompt <b>wish</b> will evaluate the script
    in <b>tcl_prompt1</b>. The variable <b>tcl_prompt2</b> is used in a similar
    way when a newline is typed but the current command is not yet complete; if
    <b>tcl_prompt2</b> is not set then no prompt is output for incomplete
    commands.</p>
