<p class="Pp">perlsolaris - Perl version 5 on Solaris systems</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This document describes various features of Sun's Solaris
    operating system that will affect how Perl version 5 (hereafter just perl)
    is compiled and/or runs. Some issues relating to the older SunOS 4.x are
    also discussed, though they may be out of date.</p>
<p class="Pp">For the most part, everything should just work.</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with Solaris 8, perl5.00503 (or higher) is supplied with
    the operating system, so you might not even need to build a newer version of
    perl at all. The Sun-supplied version is installed in /usr/perl5 with
    <i>/usr/bin/perl</i> pointing to <i>/usr/perl5/bin/perl</i>. Do not disturb
    that installation unless you really know what you are doing. If you remove
    the perl supplied with the OS, you will render some bits of your system
    inoperable. If you wish to install a newer version of perl, install it under
    a different prefix from /usr/perl5. Common prefixes to use are /usr/local
    and /opt/perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may wish to put your version of perl in the PATH of all users
    by changing the link <i>/usr/bin/perl</i>. This is probably OK, as most perl
    scripts shipped with Solaris use an explicit path. (There are a few
    exceptions, such as <i>/usr/bin/rpm2cpio</i> and
    <i>/etc/rcm/scripts/README</i>, but these are also sufficiently generic that
    the actual version of perl probably doesn't matter too much.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Solaris ships with a range of Solaris-specific modules. If you
    choose to install your own version of perl you will find the source of many
    of these modules is available on CPAN under the Sun::Solaris::
  namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">Solaris may include two versions of perl, e.g. Solaris 9 includes
    both 5.005_03 and 5.6.1. This is to provide stability across Solaris
    releases, in cases where a later perl version has incompatibilities with the
    version included in the preceding Solaris release. The default perl version
    will always be the most recent, and in general the old version will only be
    retained for one Solaris release. Note also that the default perl will NOT
    be configured to search for modules in the older version, again due to
    compatibility/stability concerns. As a consequence if you upgrade Solaris,
    you will have to rebuild/reinstall any additional CPAN modules that you
    installed for the previous Solaris version. See the CPAN manpage under
    'autobundle' for a quick way of doing this.</p>
<p class="Pp">As an interim measure, you may either change the #! line of your
    scripts to specifically refer to the old perl version, e.g. on Solaris 9 use
    #!/usr/perl5/5.00503/bin/perl to use the perl version that was the default
    for Solaris 8, or if you have a large number of scripts it may be more
    convenient to make the old version of perl the default on your system. You
    can do this by changing the appropriate symlinks under /usr/perl5 as follows
    (example for Solaris 9):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> # cd /usr/perl5
 # rm bin man pod
 # ln -s ./5.00503/bin
 # ln -s ./5.00503/man
 # ln -s ./5.00503/lib/pod
 # rm /usr/bin/perl
 # ln -s ../perl5/5.00503/bin/perl /usr/bin/perl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In both cases this should only be considered to be a temporary
    measure - you should upgrade to the later version of perl as soon as is
    practicable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note also that the perl command-line utilities (e.g. perldoc) and
    any that are added by modules that you install will be under /usr/perl5/bin,
    so that directory should be added to your PATH.</p>

  Version Numbers.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">For consistency with common usage, perl's Configure script
    performs some minor manipulations on the operating system name and version
    number as reported by uname. Here's a partial translation table:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>          Sun:                      perl's Configure:
 uname    uname -r   Name           osname     osvers
 SunOS    4.1.3     Solaris 1.1     sunos      4.1.3
 SunOS    5.6       Solaris 2.6     solaris    2.6
 SunOS    5.8       Solaris 8       solaris    2.8

<h2 class="Ss" id="File_Extraction_Problems_on_Solaris."><a class="permalink" href="#File_Extraction_Problems_on_Solaris.">File
  Extraction Problems on Solaris.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Be sure to use a tar program compiled under Solaris (not SunOS
    4.x) to extract the perl-5.x.x.tar.gz file. Do not use GNU tar compiled for
    SunOS4 on Solaris. (GNU tar compiled for Solaris should be fine.) When you
    run SunOS4 binaries on Solaris, the run-time system magically alters
    pathnames matching m#lib/locale# so that when tar tries to create
    lib/locale.pm, a file named lib/oldlocale.pm gets created instead. If you
    found this advice too late and used a SunOS4-compiled tar anyway, you must
    find the incorrectly renamed file and move it back to lib/locale.pm.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Compiler_and_Related_Tools_on_Solaris."><a class="permalink" href="#Compiler_and_Related_Tools_on_Solaris.">Compiler
  and Related Tools on Solaris.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You must use an ANSI C compiler to build perl. Perl can be
    compiled with either Sun's add-on C compiler or with gcc. The C compiler
    that shipped with SunOS4 will not do.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Include /usr/ccs/bin/ in your PATH.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Several tools needed to build perl are located in /usr/ccs/bin/:
    ar, as, ld, and make. Make sure that /usr/ccs/bin/ is in your PATH.</p>
<p class="Pp">On all the released versions of Solaris (8, 9 and 10) you need to
    make sure the following packages are installed (this info is extracted from
    the Solaris FAQ):</p>
<p class="Pp">for tools (sccs, lex, yacc, make, nm, truss, ld, as): SUNWbtool,
    SUNWsprot, SUNWtoo</p>
<p class="Pp">for libraries &amp; headers: SUNWhea, SUNWarc, SUNWlibm,
    SUNWlibms, SUNWdfbh, SUNWcg6h, SUNWxwinc</p>
<p class="Pp">Additionally, on Solaris 8 and 9 you also need:</p>
<p class="Pp">for 64 bit development: SUNWarcx, SUNWbtoox, SUNWdplx, SUNWscpux,
    SUNWsprox, SUNWtoox, SUNWlmsx, SUNWlmx, SUNWlibCx</p>
<p class="Pp">And only on Solaris 8 you also need:</p>
<p class="Pp">for libraries &amp; headers: SUNWolinc</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are in doubt which package contains a file you are missing,
    try to find an installation that has that file. Then do a</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> $ grep /my/missing/file /var/sadm/install/contents
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will display a line like this:</p>
<p class="Pp">/usr/include/sys/errno.h f none 0644 root bin 7471 37605 956241356
    SUNWhea</p>
<p class="Pp">The last item listed (SUNWhea in this example) is the package you
    need.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Avoid /usr/ucb/cc.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">You don't need to have /usr/ucb/ in your PATH to build perl. If
    you want /usr/ucb/ in your PATH anyway, make sure that /usr/ucb/ is NOT in
    your PATH before the directory containing the right C compiler.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Sun's C Compiler</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If you use Sun's C compiler, make sure the correct directory
    (usually /opt/SUNWspro/bin/) is in your PATH (before /usr/ucb/).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>GCC</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If you use gcc, make sure your installation is recent and
    complete. perl versions since 5.6.0 build fine with gcc &gt; 2.8.1 on
    Solaris &gt;= 2.6.</p>
<p class="Pp">You must Configure perl with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> $ sh Configure -Dcc=gcc
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you don't, you may experience strange build errors.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you have updated your Solaris version, you may also have to
    update your gcc. For example, if you are running Solaris 2.6 and your gcc is
    installed under /usr/local, check in /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib and make sure
    you have the appropriate directory, sparc-sun-solaris2.6/ or
    i386-pc-solaris2.6/. If gcc's directory is for a different version of
    Solaris than you are running, then you will need to rebuild gcc for your new
    version of Solaris.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can get a precompiled version of gcc from
    &lt;http://www.sunfreeware.com/&gt; or &lt;http://www.blastwave.org/&gt;.
    Make sure you pick up the package for your Solaris release.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you wish to use gcc to build add-on modules for use with the
    perl shipped with Solaris, you should use the Solaris::PerlGcc module which
    is available from CPAN. The perl shipped with Solaris is configured and
    built with the Sun compilers, and the compiler configuration information
    stored in Config.pm is therefore only relevant to the Sun compilers. The
    Solaris:PerlGcc module contains a replacement Config.pm that is correct for
    gcc - see the module for details.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>GNU as and GNU ld</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The following information applies to gcc version 2. Volunteers to
    update it as appropriately for gcc version 3 would be appreciated.</p>
<p class="Pp">The versions of as and ld supplied with Solaris work fine for
    building perl. There is normally no need to install the GNU versions to
    compile perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you decide to ignore this advice and use the GNU versions
    anyway, then be sure that they are relatively recent. Versions newer than
    2.7 are apparently new enough. Older versions may have trouble with dynamic
    loading.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you wish to use GNU ld, then you need to pass it the -Wl,-E
    flag. The hints/solaris_2.sh file tries to do this automatically by setting
    the following Configure variables:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> ccdlflags=&quot;$ccdlflags -Wl,-E&quot;
 lddlflags=&quot;$lddlflags -Wl,-E -G&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, over the years, changes in gcc, GNU ld, and Solaris ld
    have made it difficult to automatically detect which ld ultimately gets
    called. You may have to manually edit config.sh and add the -Wl,-E flags
    yourself, or else run Configure interactively and add the flags at the
    appropriate prompts.</p>
<p class="Pp">If your gcc is configured to use GNU as and ld but you want to use
    the Solaris ones instead to build perl, then you'll need to add
    -B/usr/ccs/bin/ to the gcc command line. One convenient way to do that is
    with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> $ sh Configure -Dcc='gcc -B/usr/ccs/bin/'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that the trailing slash is required. This will result in some
    harmless warnings as Configure is run:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> gcc: file path prefix `/usr/ccs/bin/' never used
</pre>
<p class="Pp">These messages may safely be ignored. (Note that for a SunOS4
    system, you must use -B/bin/ instead.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, you can use the GCC_EXEC_PREFIX environment
    variable to ensure that Sun's as and ld are used. Consult your gcc
    documentation for further information on the -B option and the
    GCC_EXEC_PREFIX variable.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Sun and GNU make</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The make under /usr/ccs/bin works fine for building perl. If you
    have the Sun C compilers, you will also have a parallel version of make
    (dmake). This works fine to build perl, but can sometimes cause problems
    when running 'make test' due to underspecified dependencies between the
    different test harness files. The same problem can also affect the building
    of some add-on modules, so in those cases either specify '-m serial' on the
    dmake command line, or use /usr/ccs/bin/make instead. If you wish to use GNU
    make, be sure that the set-group-id bit is not set. If it is, then arrange
    your PATH so that /usr/ccs/bin/make is before GNU make or else have the
    system administrator disable the set-group-id bit on GNU make.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Avoid libucb.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Solaris provides some BSD-compatibility functions in
    /usr/ucblib/libucb.a. Perl will not build and run correctly if linked
    against -lucb since it contains routines that are incompatible with the
    standard Solaris libc. Normally this is not a problem since the solaris
    hints file prevents Configure from even looking in /usr/ucblib for
    libraries, and also explicitly omits -lucb.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Environment_for_Compiling_perl_on_Solaris"><a class="permalink" href="#Environment_for_Compiling_perl_on_Solaris">Environment
  for Compiling perl on Solaris</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><i>PATH</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Make sure your PATH includes the compiler (/opt/SUNWspro/bin/ if
    you're using Sun's compiler) as well as /usr/ccs/bin/ to pick up the other
    development tools (such as make, ar, as, and ld). Make sure your path either
    doesn't include /usr/ucb or that it includes it after the compiler and
    compiler tools and other standard Solaris directories. You definitely don't
    want /usr/ucb/cc.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</i></p>
<p class="Pp">If you have the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable set, be sure
    that it does NOT include /lib or /usr/lib. If you will be building
    extensions that call third-party shared libraries (e.g. Berkeley DB) then
    make sure that your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable includes the
    directory with that library (e.g. /usr/local/lib).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you get an error message</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> dlopen: stub interception failed
</pre>
<p class="Pp">it is probably because your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
    includes a directory which is a symlink to /usr/lib (such as /lib). The
    reason this causes a problem is quite subtle. The file libdl.so.1.0 actually
    *only* contains functions which generate 'stub interception failed' errors!
    The runtime linker intercepts links to &quot;/usr/lib/libdl.so.1.0&quot; and
    links in internal implementations of those functions instead. [Thanks to Tim
    Bunce for this explanation.]</p>

    Only Solaris-specific issues are discussed here. Usually, the defaults
    should be fine.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="64"><a class="permalink" href="#64">64-bit perl on
  Solaris.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">See the INSTALL file for general information regarding 64-bit
    compiles. In general, the defaults should be fine for most people.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, perl-5.6.0 (or later) is compiled as a 32-bit
    application with largefile and long-long support.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>General 32-bit vs. 64-bit issues.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Solaris 7 and above will run in either 32 bit or 64 bit mode on
    SPARC CPUs, via a reboot. You can build 64 bit apps whilst running 32 bit
    mode and vice-versa. 32 bit apps will run under Solaris running in either 32
    or 64 bit mode. 64 bit apps require Solaris to be running 64 bit mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">Existing 32 bit apps are properly known as LP32, i.e. Longs and
    Pointers are 32 bit. 64-bit apps are more properly known as LP64. The
    discriminating feature of a LP64 bit app is its ability to utilise a 64-bit
    address space. It is perfectly possible to have a LP32 bit app that supports
    both 64-bit integers (long long) and largefiles (&gt; 2GB), and this is the
    default for perl-5.6.0.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more complete explanation of 64-bit issues, see the
    &quot;Solaris 64-bit Developer's Guide&quot; at
  &lt;http://docs.sun.com/&gt;</p>
<p class="Pp">You can detect the OS mode using &quot;isainfo -v&quot;, e.g.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> $ isainfo -v   # Ultra 30 in 64 bit mode
 64-bit sparcv9 applications
 32-bit sparc applications
</pre>
<p class="Pp">By default, perl will be compiled as a 32-bit application. Unless
    you want to allocate more than ~ 4GB of memory inside perl, or unless you
    need more than 255 open file descriptors, you probably don't need perl to be
    a 64-bit app.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Large File Support</i></p>
<p class="Pp">For Solaris 2.6 and onwards, there are two different ways for
    32-bit applications to manipulate large files (files whose size is &gt;
    2GByte). (A 64-bit application automatically has largefile support built in
    by default.)</p>
<p class="Pp">First is the &quot;transitional compilation environment&quot;,
    described in <b>lfcompile64</b>(5). According to the man page,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> The transitional compilation  environment  exports  all  the
 explicit 64-bit functions (xxx64()) and types in addition to
 all the regular functions (xxx()) and types. Both xxx()  and
 xxx64()  functions  are  available to the program source.  A
 32-bit application must use the xxx64() functions in  order
 to  access  large  files.  See the lf64(5) manual page for a
 complete listing of the 64-bit transitional interfaces.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The transitional compilation environment is obtained with the
    following compiler and linker flags:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> getconf LFS64_CFLAGS        -D_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE
 getconf LFS64_LDFLAG        # nothing special needed
 getconf LFS64_LIBS          # nothing special needed
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Second is the &quot;large file compilation environment&quot;,
    described in <b>lfcompile</b>(5). According to the man page,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> Each interface named xxx() that needs to access 64-bit entities
 to  access  large  files maps to a xxx64() call in the
 resulting binary. All relevant data types are defined to  be
 of correct size (for example, off_t has a typedef definition
 for a 64-bit entity).
 An application compiled in this environment is able  to  use
 the  xxx()  source interfaces to access both large and small
 files, rather than having to explicitly utilize the  transitional
 xxx64()  interface  calls to access large files.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Two exceptions are <b>fseek()</b> and <b>ftell()</b>. 32-bit
    applications should use fseeko(3C) and ftello(3C). These will get
    automatically mapped to <b>fseeko64()</b> and <b>ftello64()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The large file compilation environment is obtained with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> getconf LFS_CFLAGS      -D_LARGEFILE_SOURCE -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64
 getconf LFS_LDFLAGS     # nothing special needed
 getconf LFS_LIBS        # nothing special needed
</pre>
<p class="Pp">By default, perl uses the large file compilation environment and
    relies on Solaris to do the underlying mapping of interfaces.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Building an LP64 perl</i></p>
<p class="Pp">To compile a 64-bit application on an UltraSparc with a recent Sun
    Compiler, you need to use the flag &quot;-xarch=v9&quot;. <b>getconf</b>(1)
    will tell you this, e.g.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> $ getconf -a | grep v9
 XBS5_LP64_OFF64_CFLAGS:         -xarch=v9
 XBS5_LP64_OFF64_LDFLAGS:        -xarch=v9
 XBS5_LP64_OFF64_LINTFLAGS:      -xarch=v9
 XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_CFLAGS:       -xarch=v9
 XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_LDFLAGS:      -xarch=v9
 XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_LINTFLAGS:    -xarch=v9
 _XBS5_LP64_OFF64_CFLAGS:        -xarch=v9
 _XBS5_LP64_OFF64_LDFLAGS:       -xarch=v9
 _XBS5_LP64_OFF64_LINTFLAGS:     -xarch=v9
 _XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_CFLAGS:      -xarch=v9
 _XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_LDFLAGS:     -xarch=v9
 _XBS5_LPBIG_OFFBIG_LINTFLAGS:   -xarch=v9
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This flag is supported in Sun WorkShop Compilers 5.0 and onwards
    (now marketed under the name Forte) when used on Solaris 7 or later on
    UltraSparc systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are using gcc, you would need to use -mcpu=v9 -m64 instead.
    This option is not yet supported as of gcc 2.95.2; from install/SPECIFIC in
    that release:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> GCC version 2.95 is not able to compile code correctly for sparc64
 targets. Users of the Linux kernel, at least, can use the sparc32
 program to start up a new shell invocation with an environment that
 causes configure to recognize (via uname -a) the system as sparc-*-*
 instead.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">All this should be handled automatically by the hints file, if
    requested.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Long Doubles.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">As of 5.8.1, long doubles are working if you use the Sun compilers
    (needed for additional math routines not included in libm).</p>

  Issues with perl on Solaris.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Starting from perl 5.7.1 perl uses the Solaris malloc, since the
    perl malloc breaks when dealing with more than 2GB of memory, and the
    Solaris malloc also seems to be faster.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you for some reason (such as binary backward compatibility)
    really need to use perl's malloc, you can rebuild perl from the sources and
    Configure the build with</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> $ sh Configure -Dusemymalloc
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You should not use perl's malloc if you are building with gcc.
    There are reports of core dumps, especially in the PDL module. The problem
    appears to go away under -DDEBUGGING, so it has been difficult to track
    down. Sun's compiler appears to be okay with or without perl's malloc. [XXX
    further investigation is needed here.]</p>

  <dd>The primary cause of the 'dlopen: stub interception failed' message is

      above.</dd>
  <dt>#error &quot;No DATAMODEL_NATIVE specified&quot;</dt>
  <dd>This is a common error when trying to build perl on Solaris 2.6 with a gcc
      installation from Solaris 2.5 or 2.5.1. The Solaris header files changed,
      so you need to update your gcc installation. You can either rerun the
      fixincludes script from gcc or take the opportunity to update your gcc
      installation.</dd>
  <dt id="sh:"><a class="permalink" href="#sh:">sh: ar: not found</a></dt>
  <dd>This is a message from your shell telling you that the command 'ar' was

      that it includes the directory with the 'ar' command. This is a common
      problem on Solaris, where 'ar' is in the /usr/ccs/bin/ directory.</dd>

<p class="Pp">Nothing too unusual here. You can easily do this if you have a

  on Numbers of Open Files on Solaris.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The stdio(3C) manpage notes that for LP32 applications, only 255
    files may be opened using <b>fopen()</b>, and only file descriptors 0
    through 255 can be used in a stream. Since perl calls <b>open()</b> and then
    fdopen(3C) with the resulting file descriptor, perl is limited to 255
    simultaneous open files, even if <b>sysopen()</b> is used. If this proves to
    be an insurmountable problem, you can compile perl as a LP64 application,
    see &quot;Building an LP64 perl&quot; for details. Note also that the
    default resource limit for open file descriptors on Solaris is 255, so you
    will have to modify your ulimit or rctl (Solaris 9 onwards)
  appropriately.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Proc::ProcessTable_on_Solaris"><a class="permalink" href="#Proc::ProcessTable_on_Solaris">Proc::ProcessTable
  on Solaris</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Proc::ProcessTable does not compile on Solaris with perl5.6.0 and
    higher if you have LARGEFILES defined. Since largefile support is the
    default in 5.6.0 and later, you have to take special steps to use this
    module.</p>
<p class="Pp">The problem is that various structures visible via procfs use
    off_t, and if you compile with largefile support these change from 32 bits
    to 64 bits. Thus what you get back from procfs doesn't match up with the
    structures in perl, resulting in garbage. See <b>proc</b>(4) for further
    discussion.</p>
<p class="Pp">A fix for Proc::ProcessTable is to edit Makefile to explicitly
    remove the largefile flags from the ones MakeMaker picks up from Config.pm.
    This will result in Proc::ProcessTable being built under the correct
    environment. Everything should then be OK as long as Proc::ProcessTable
    doesn't try to share off_t's with the rest of perl, or if it does they
    should be explicitly specified as off64_t.</p>

<p class="Pp">BSD::Resource versions earlier than 1.09 do not compile on Solaris
    with perl 5.6.0 and higher, for the same reasons as Proc::ProcessTable.
    BSD::Resource versions starting from 1.09 have a workaround for the

<p class="Pp">Net::SSLeay requires a /dev/urandom to be present. This device is
    available from Solaris 9 onwards. For earlier Solaris versions you can
    either get the package SUNWski (packaged with several Sun software products,
    for example the Sun WebServer, which is part of the Solaris Server Intranet
    Extension, or the Sun Directory Services, part of Solaris for ISPs) or
    download the ANDIrand package from &lt;http://www.cosy.sbg.ac.at/~andi/&gt;.
    If you use SUNWski, make a symbolic link /dev/urandom pointing to
    /dev/random. For more details, see Document ID27606 entitled &quot;Differing
    /dev/random support requirements within Solaris[TM] Operating
    Environments&quot;, available at &lt;http://sunsolve.sun.com&gt; .</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SunOS_4.x"><a class="permalink" href="#SunOS_4.x">SunOS
  4.x</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">In SunOS 4.x you most probably want to use the SunOS ld,
    /usr/bin/ld, since the more recent versions of GNU ld (like 2.13) do not
    seem to work for building Perl anymore. When linking the extensions, the GNU
    ld gets very unhappy and spews a lot of errors like this</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  ... relocation truncated to fit: BASE13 ...
</pre>
<p class="Pp">and dies. Therefore the SunOS 4.1 hints file explicitly sets the
    ld to be <i>/usr/bin/ld</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.8.1 the dynamic loading of libraries (DynaLoader,
    XSLoader) also seems to have become broken in in SunOS 4.x. Therefore the
    default is to build Perl statically.</p>
<p class="Pp">Running the test suite in SunOS 4.1 is a bit tricky since the
    <i>dist/Tie-File/t/09_gen_rs.t</i> test hangs (subtest #51, FWIW) for some
    unknown reason. Just stop the test and kill that particular Perl
  process.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are various other failures, that as of SunOS 4.1.4 and gcc
    3.2.2 look a lot like gcc bugs. Many of the failures happen in the Encode
    tests, where for example when the test expects &quot;0&quot; you get
    &quot;&amp;#48;&quot; which should after a little squinting look very odd
    indeed. Another example is earlier in <i>t/run/fresh_perl</i> where
    <b>chr</b>(0xff) is expected but the test fails because the result is
    <b>chr</b>(0xff). Exactly.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is the &quot;make test&quot; result from the said
    combination:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>  Failed 27 test scripts out of 745, 96.38% okay.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Running the <span class="Li">&quot;harness&quot;</span> is painful
    because of the many failing Unicode-related tests will output megabytes of
    failure messages, but if one patiently waits, one gets these results:</p>
