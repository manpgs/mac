  names</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl has three built-in data types: scalars, arrays of scalars,
    and associative arrays of scalars, known as &quot;hashes&quot;. A scalar is
    a single string (of any size, limited only by the available memory), number,
    or a reference to something (which will be discussed in perlref). Normal
    arrays are ordered lists of scalars indexed by number, starting with 0.
    Hashes are unordered collections of scalar values indexed by their
    associated string key.</p>
<p class="Pp">Values are usually referred to by name, or through a named
    reference. The first character of the name tells you to what sort of data
    structure it refers. The rest of the name tells you the particular value to
    which it refers. Usually this name is a single <i>identifier</i>, that is, a
    string beginning with a letter or underscore, and containing letters,
    underscores, and digits. In some cases, it may be a chain of identifiers,
    separated by <span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span> (or by the slightly
    archaic <span class="Li">&quot;'&quot;</span>); all but the last are
    interpreted as names of packages, to locate the namespace in which to look
    up the final identifier (see &quot;Packages&quot; in perlmod for details).
    For a more in-depth discussion on identifiers, see &quot;Identifier
    parsing&quot;. It's possible to substitute for a simple identifier, an
    expression that produces a reference to the value at runtime. This is
    described in more detail below and in perlref.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl also has its own built-in variables whose names don't follow
    these rules. They have strange names so they don't accidentally collide with
    one of your normal variables. Strings that match parenthesized parts of a
    regular expression are saved under names containing only digits after the
    <span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span> (see perlop and perlre). In addition,
    several special variables that provide windows into the inner working of
    Perl have names containing punctuation characters. These are documented in
    perlvar.</p>
<p class="Pp">Scalar values are always named with '$', even when referring to a
    scalar that is part of an array or a hash. The '$' symbol works semantically
    like the English word &quot;the&quot; in that it indicates a single value is
    expected.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $days               # the simple scalar value &quot;days&quot;
    $days[28]           # the 29th element of array @days
    $days{'Feb'}        # the 'Feb' value from hash %days
    $#days              # the last index of array @days
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Entire arrays (and slices of arrays and hashes) are denoted by
    '@', which works much as the word &quot;these&quot; or &quot;those&quot;
    does in English, in that it indicates multiple values are expected.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @days               # ($days[0], $days[1],... $days[n])
    @days[3,4,5]        # same as ($days[3],$days[4],$days[5])
    @days{'a','c'}      # same as ($days{'a'},$days{'c'})
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Entire hashes are denoted by '%':</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    %days               # (key1, val1, key2, val2 ...)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In addition, subroutines are named with an initial '&amp;', though
    this is optional when unambiguous, just as the word &quot;do&quot; is often
    redundant in English. Symbol table entries can be named with an initial '*',
    but you don't really care about that yet (if ever :-).</p>
<p class="Pp">Every variable type has its own namespace, as do several
    non-variable identifiers. This means that you can, without fear of conflict,
    use the same name for a scalar variable, an array, or a hash--or, for that
    matter, for a filehandle, a directory handle, a subroutine name, a format
    name, or a label. This means that <span class="Li">$foo</span> and
    <span class="Li">@foo</span> are two different variables. It also means that
    <span class="Li">$foo[1]</span> is a part of <span class="Li">@foo</span>,
    not a part of <span class="Li">$foo</span>. This may seem a bit weird, but
    that's okay, because it is weird.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because variable references always start with '$', '@', or '%',
    the &quot;reserved&quot; words aren't in fact reserved with respect to
    variable names. They <i>are</i> reserved with respect to labels and
    filehandles, however, which don't have an initial special character. You
    can't have a filehandle named &quot;log&quot;, for instance. Hint: you could
    say <span class="Li">&quot;open(LOG,'logfile')&quot;</span> rather than
    <span class="Li">&quot;open(log,'logfile')&quot;</span>. Using uppercase
    filehandles also improves readability and protects you from conflict with
    future reserved words. Case <i>is</i> significant--&quot;FOO&quot;,
    &quot;Foo&quot;, and &quot;foo&quot; are all different names. Names that
    start with a letter or underscore may also contain digits and
  underscores.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is possible to replace such an alphanumeric name with an
    expression that returns a reference to the appropriate type. For a
    description of this, see perlref.</p>
<p class="Pp">Names that start with a digit may contain only more digits. Names
    that do not start with a letter, underscore, digit or a caret are limited to
    one character, e.g., <span class="Li">$%</span> or
    <span class="Li">$$</span>. (Most of these one character names have a
    predefined significance to Perl. For instance, <span class="Li">$$</span> is
    the current process id. And all such names are reserved for Perl's possible
    use.)</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Identifier_parsing"><a class="permalink" href="#Identifier_parsing">Identifier
  parsing</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Up until Perl 5.18, the actual rules of what a valid identifier
    was were a bit fuzzy. However, in general, anything defined here should work
    on previous versions of Perl, while the opposite -- edge cases that work in
    previous versions, but aren't defined here -- probably won't work on newer
    versions. As an important side note, please note that the following only
    applies to bareword identifiers as found in Perl source code, not
    identifiers introduced through symbolic references, which have much fewer
    restrictions. If working under the effect of the <span class="Li">&quot;use
    utf8;&quot;</span> pragma, the following rules apply:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    / (?[ ( \p{Word} &amp; \p{XID_Start} ) + [_] ])
      (?[ ( \p{Word} &amp; \p{XID_Continue} ) ]) *    /x
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That is, a &quot;start&quot; character followed by any number of
    &quot;continue&quot; characters. Perl requires every character in an
    identifier to also match <span class="Li">&quot;\w&quot;</span> (this
    prevents some problematic cases); and Perl additionally accepts identfier
    names beginning with an underscore.</p>
<p class="Pp">If not under <span class="Li">&quot;use utf8&quot;</span>, the
    source is treated as ASCII + 128 extra generic characters, and identifiers
    should match</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    / (?aa) (?!\d) \w+ /x
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That is, any word character in the ASCII range, as long as the
    first character is not a digit.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are two package separators in Perl: A double colon
    (<span class="Li">&quot;::&quot;</span>) and a single quote
    (<span class="Li">&quot;'&quot;</span>). Normal identifiers can start or end
    with a double colon, and can contain several parts delimited by double
    colons. Single quotes have similar rules, but with the exception that they
    are not legal at the end of an identifier: That is,
    <span class="Li">&quot;$'foo&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;$foo'bar&quot;</span> are legal, but
    <span class="Li">&quot;$foo'bar'&quot;</span> is not.</p>
<p class="Pp">Additionally, if the identifier is preceded by a sigil -- that is,
    if the identifier is part of a variable name -- it may optionally be
    enclosed in braces.</p>
<p class="Pp">While you can mix double colons with singles quotes, the quotes
    must come after the colons: <span class="Li">&quot;$::::'foo&quot;</span>
    and <span class="Li">&quot;$foo::'bar&quot;</span> are legal, but
    <span class="Li">&quot;$::'::foo&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;$foo'::bar&quot;</span> are not.</p>
<p class="Pp">Put together, a grammar to match a basic identifier becomes</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
 /
  (?(DEFINE)
      (?&lt;variable&gt;
          (?&amp;sigil)
          (?:
                  (?&amp;normal_identifier)
              |   \{ \s* (?&amp;normal_identifier) \s* \}
          )
      )
      (?&lt;normal_identifier&gt;
          (?: :: )* '?
           (?&amp;basic_identifier)
           (?: (?= (?: :: )+ '? | (?: :: )* ' ) (?&amp;normal_identifier) )?
          (?: :: )*
      )
      (?&lt;basic_identifier&gt;
        # is use utf8 on?
          (?(?{ (caller(0))[8] &amp; $utf8::hint_bits })
              (?&amp;Perl_XIDS) (?&amp;Perl_XIDC)*
            | (?aa) (?!\d) \w+
          )
      )
      (?&lt;sigil&gt; [&amp;*\$\@\%])
      (?&lt;Perl_XIDS&gt; (?[ ( \p{Word} &amp; \p{XID_Start} ) + [_] ]) )
      (?&lt;Perl_XIDC&gt; (?[ \p{Word} &amp; \p{XID_Continue} ]) )
  )
 /x
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Meanwhile, special identifiers don't follow the above rules; For
    the most part, all of the identifiers in this category have a special
    meaning given by Perl. Because they have special parsing rules, these
    generally can't be fully-qualified. They come in six forms (but don't use
    forms 5 and 6):</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>A sigil, followed solely by digits matching
      <span class="Li">&quot;\p{POSIX_Digit}&quot;</span>, like
      <span class="Li">$0</span>, <span class="Li">$1</span>, or
      <span class="Li">$10000</span>.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>A sigil followed by a single character matching the
      <span class="Li">&quot;\p{POSIX_Punct}&quot;</span> property, like
      <span class="Li">$!</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;%+&quot;</span>,
      except the character <span class="Li">&quot;{&quot;</span> doesn't
    work.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>A sigil, followed by a caret and any one of the characters
      <span class="Li">&quot;[][A-Z^_?\]&quot;</span>, like
      <span class="Li">$^V</span> or <span class="Li">$^]</span>.</dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>Similar to the above, a sigil, followed by bareword text in braces, where
      the first character is a caret. The next character is any one of the
      characters <span class="Li">&quot;[][A-Z^_?\]&quot;</span>, followed by
      ASCII word characters. An example is
      <span class="Li">&quot;${^GLOBAL_PHASE}&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>5.</dt>
  <dd>A sigil, followed by any single character in the range
      <span class="Li">&quot;[\xA1-\xAC\xAE-\xFF]&quot;</span> when not under
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;utf8&quot;</span>. (Under
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;utf8&quot;</span>, the normal identifier
      rules given earlier in this section apply.) Use of non-graphic characters
      (the C1 controls, the NO-BREAK SPACE, and the SOFT HYPHEN) has been
      disallowed since v5.26.0. The use of the other characters is unwise, as
      these are all reserved to have special meaning to Perl, and none of them
      currently do have special meaning, though this could change without
      notice.
    <p class="Pp">Note that an implication of this form is that there are
        identifiers only legal under
        <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;utf8&quot;</span>, and vice-versa, for
        example the identifier <span class="Li">&quot;$etat&quot;</span> is
        legal under <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;utf8&quot;</span>, but is
        otherwise considered to be the single character variable
        <span class="Li">&quot;$e&quot;</span> followed by the bareword
        <span class="Li">&quot;tat&quot;</span>, the combination of which is a
        syntax error.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>6.</dt>
  <dd>This is a combination of the previous two forms. It is valid only when not
      under <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;utf8&quot;</span> (normal
      identifier rules apply when under
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&#x00A0;utf8&quot;</span>). The form is a sigil,
      followed by text in braces, where the first character is any one of the
      characters in the range <span class="Li">&quot;[\x80-\xFF]&quot;</span>
      followed by ASCII word characters up to the trailing brace.
    <p class="Pp">The same caveats as the previous form apply: The non-graphic
        characters are no longer allowed with &quot;use&#x00A0;utf8&quot;, it is
        unwise to use this form at all, and utf8ness makes a big difference.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Prior to Perl v5.24, non-graphical ASCII control characters were
    also allowed in some situations; this had been deprecated since v5.20.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Context"><a class="permalink" href="#Context">Context</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The interpretation of operations and values in Perl sometimes
    depends on the requirements of the context around the operation or value.
    There are two major contexts: list and scalar. Certain operations return
    list values in contexts wanting a list, and scalar values otherwise. If this
    is true of an operation it will be mentioned in the documentation for that
    operation. In other words, Perl overloads certain operations based on
    whether the expected return value is singular or plural. Some words in
    English work this way, like &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;sheep&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">In a reciprocal fashion, an operation provides either a scalar or
    a list context to each of its arguments. For example, if you say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    int( &lt;STDIN&gt; )
</pre>
<p class="Pp">the integer operation provides scalar context for the &lt;&gt;
    operator, which responds by reading one line from STDIN and passing it back
    to the integer operation, which will then find the integer value of that
    line and return that. If, on the other hand, you say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    sort( &lt;STDIN&gt; )
</pre>
<p class="Pp">then the sort operation provides list context for &lt;&gt;, which
    will proceed to read every line available up to the end of file, and pass
    that list of lines back to the sort routine, which will then sort those
    lines and return them as a list to whatever the context of the sort was.</p>
<p class="Pp">Assignment is a little bit special in that it uses its left
    argument to determine the context for the right argument. Assignment to a
    scalar evaluates the right-hand side in scalar context, while assignment to
    an array or hash evaluates the righthand side in list context. Assignment to
    a list (or slice, which is just a list anyway) also evaluates the right-hand
    side in list context.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you use the <span class="Li">&quot;use warnings&quot;</span>
    pragma or Perl's <b>-w</b> command-line option, you may see warnings about
    useless uses of constants or functions in &quot;void context&quot;. Void
    context just means the value has been discarded, such as a statement
    containing only <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;fred&quot;;&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;getpwuid(0);&quot;</span>. It still counts as scalar
    context for functions that care whether or not they're being called in list
    context.</p>
<p class="Pp">User-defined subroutines may choose to care whether they are being
    called in a void, scalar, or list context. Most subroutines do not need to
    bother, though. That's because both scalars and lists are automatically
    interpolated into lists. See &quot;wantarray&quot; in perlfunc for how you
    would dynamically discern your function's calling context.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Scalar_values"><a class="permalink" href="#Scalar_values">Scalar
  values</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">All data in Perl is a scalar, an array of scalars, or a hash of
    scalars. A scalar may contain one single value in any of three different
    flavors: a number, a string, or a reference. In general, conversion from one
    form to another is transparent. Although a scalar may not directly hold
    multiple values, it may contain a reference to an array or hash which in
    turn contains multiple values.</p>
<p class="Pp">Scalars aren't necessarily one thing or another. There's no place
    to declare a scalar variable to be of type &quot;string&quot;, type
    &quot;number&quot;, type &quot;reference&quot;, or anything else. Because of
    the automatic conversion of scalars, operations that return scalars don't
    need to care (and in fact, cannot care) whether their caller is looking for
    a string, a number, or a reference. Perl is a contextually polymorphic
    language whose scalars can be strings, numbers, or references (which
    includes objects). Although strings and numbers are considered pretty much
    the same thing for nearly all purposes, references are strongly-typed,
    uncastable pointers with builtin reference-counting and destructor
    invocation.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">A scalar value is interpreted as FALSE in the Boolean sense if it
    is undefined, the null string or the number 0 (or its string equivalent,
    &quot;0&quot;), and TRUE if it is anything else. The Boolean context is just
    a special kind of scalar context where no conversion to a string or a number
    is ever performed. Negation of a true value by
    <span class="Li">&quot;!&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;not&quot;</span> returns a special false value. When
    evaluated as a string it is treated as <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span>,
    but as a number, it is treated as 0. Most Perl operators that return true or
    false behave this way.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are actually two varieties of null strings (sometimes
    referred to as &quot;empty&quot; strings), a defined one and an undefined
    one. The defined version is just a string of length zero, such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span>. The undefined version is the value
    that indicates that there is no real value for something, such as when there
    was an error, or at end of file, or when you refer to an uninitialized
    variable or element of an array or hash. Although in early versions of Perl,
    an undefined scalar could become defined when first used in a place
    expecting a defined value, this no longer happens except for rare cases of
    autovivification as explained in perlref. You can use the <b>defined()</b>
    operator to determine whether a scalar value is defined (this has no meaning
    on arrays or hashes), and the <b>undef()</b> operator to produce an
    undefined value.</p>
<p class="Pp">To find out whether a given string is a valid non-zero number,
    it's sometimes enough to test it against both numeric 0 and also lexical
    &quot;0&quot; (although this will cause noises if warnings are on). That's
    because strings that aren't numbers count as 0, just as they do in
    <b>awk</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    if ($str == 0 &amp;&amp; $str ne &quot;0&quot;)  {
        warn &quot;That doesn't look like a number&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">That method may be best because otherwise you won't treat IEEE
    notations like <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;Infinity&quot;</span> properly. At other times, you
    might prefer to determine whether string data can be used numerically by
    calling the <b>POSIX::strtod()</b> function or by inspecting your string
    with a regular expression (as documented in perlre).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    warn &quot;has nondigits&quot;        if     /\D/;
    warn &quot;not a natural number&quot; unless /^\d+$/;             # rejects -3
    warn &quot;not an integer&quot;       unless /^-?\d+$/;           # rejects +3
    warn &quot;not an integer&quot;       unless /^[+-]?\d+$/;
    warn &quot;not a decimal number&quot; unless /^-?\d+\.?\d*$/;     # rejects .2
    warn &quot;not a decimal number&quot; unless /^-?(?:\d+(?:\.\d*)?|\.\d+)$/;
    warn &quot;not a C float&quot;
        unless /^([+-]?)(?=\d|\.\d)\d*(\.\d*)?([Ee]([+-]?\d+))?$/;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The length of an array is a scalar value. You may find the length
    of array <span class="Li">@days</span> by evaluating
    <span class="Li">$#days</span>, as in <b>csh</b>. However, this isn't the
    length of the array; it's the subscript of the last element, which is a
    different value since there is ordinarily a 0th element. Assigning to
    <span class="Li">$#days</span> actually changes the length of the array.
    Shortening an array this way destroys intervening values. Lengthening an
    array that was previously shortened does not recover values that were in
    those elements.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also gain some minuscule measure of efficiency by
    pre-extending an array that is going to get big. You can also extend an
    array by assigning to an element that is off the end of the array. You can
    truncate an array down to nothing by assigning the null list () to it. The
    following are equivalent:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @whatever = ();
    $#whatever = -1;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you evaluate an array in scalar context, it returns the length
    of the array. (Note that this is not true of lists, which return the last
    value, like the C comma operator, nor of built-in functions, which return
    whatever they feel like returning.) The following is always true:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    scalar(@whatever) == $#whatever + 1;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Some programmers choose to use an explicit conversion so as to
    leave nothing to doubt:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $element_count = scalar(@whatever);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you evaluate a hash in scalar context, it returns a false value
    if the hash is empty. If there are any key/value pairs, it returns a true
    value. A more precise definition is version dependent.</p>
<p class="Pp">Prior to Perl 5.25 the value returned was a string consisting of
    the number of used buckets and the number of allocated buckets, separated by
    a slash. This is pretty much useful only to find out whether Perl's internal
    hashing algorithm is performing poorly on your data set. For example, you
    stick 10,000 things in a hash, but evaluating <span class="Li">%HASH</span>
    in scalar context reveals <span class="Li">&quot;1/16&quot;</span>, which
    means only one out of sixteen buckets has been touched, and presumably
    contains all 10,000 of your items. This isn't supposed to happen.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.25 the return was changed to be the count of keys in
    the hash. If you need access to the old behavior you can use
    <span class="Li">&quot;Hash::Util::bucket_ratio()&quot;</span> instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a tied hash is evaluated in scalar context, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;SCALAR&quot;</span> method is called (with a fallback
    to <span class="Li">&quot;FIRSTKEY&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">You can preallocate space for a hash by assigning to the
    <b>keys()</b> function. This rounds up the allocated buckets to the next
    power of two:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    keys(%users) = 1000;                # allocate 1024 buckets

  value constructors</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Numeric literals are specified in any of the following floating
    point or integer formats:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
 12345
 12345.67
 .23E-10             # a very small number
 3.14_15_92          # a very important number
 4_294_967_296       # underscore for legibility
 0xff                # hex
 0xdead_beef         # more hex
 0377                # octal (only numbers, begins with 0)
 0b011011            # binary
 0x1.999ap-4         # hexadecimal floating point (the 'p' is required)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You are allowed to use underscores (underbars) in numeric literals
    between digits for legibility (but not multiple underscores in a row:
    <span class="Li">&quot;23__500&quot;</span> is not legal;
    <span class="Li">&quot;23_500&quot;</span> is). You could, for example,
    group binary digits by threes (as for a Unix-style mode argument such as
    0b110_100_100) or by fours (to represent nibbles, as in 0b1010_0110) or in
    other groups.</p>
<p class="Pp">String literals are usually delimited by either single or double
    quotes. They work much like quotes in the standard Unix shells:
    double-quoted string literals are subject to backslash and variable
    substitution; single-quoted strings are not (except for
    <span class="Li">&quot;\'&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;\\&quot;</span>). The usual C-style backslash rules
    apply for making characters such as newline, tab, etc., as well as some more
    exotic forms. See &quot;Quote and Quote-like Operators&quot; in perlop for a
    list.</p>
<p class="Pp">Hexadecimal, octal, or binary, representations in string literals
    (e.g. '0xff') are not automatically converted to their integer
    representation. The <b>hex()</b> and <b>oct()</b> functions make these
    conversions for you. See &quot;hex&quot; in perlfunc and &quot;oct&quot; in
    perlfunc for more details.</p>
<p class="Pp">Hexadecimal floating point can start just like a hexadecimal
    literal, and it can be followed by an optional fractional hexadecimal part,
    but it must be followed by <span class="Li">&quot;p&quot;</span>, an
    optional sign, and a power of two. The format is useful for accurately
    presenting floating point values, avoiding conversions to or from decimal
    floating point, and therefore avoiding possible loss in precision. Notice
    that while most current platforms use the 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point,
    not all do. Another potential source of (low-order) differences are the
    floating point rounding modes, which can differ between CPUs, operating
    systems, and compilers, and which Perl doesn't control.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can also embed newlines directly in your strings, i.e., they
    can end on a different line than they begin. This is nice, but if you forget
    your trailing quote, the error will not be reported until Perl finds another
    line containing the quote character, which may be much further on in the
    script. Variable substitution inside strings is limited to scalar variables,
    arrays, and array or hash slices. (In other words, names beginning with $ or
    @, followed by an optional bracketed expression as a subscript.) The
    following code segment prints out &quot;The price is
    <span class="Li">$100</span>.&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $Price = '$100';    # not interpolated
    print &quot;The price is $Price.\n&quot;;     # interpolated
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There is no double interpolation in Perl, so the
    <span class="Li">$100</span> is left as is.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default floating point numbers substituted inside strings use
    the dot (&quot;.&quot;) as the decimal separator. If
    <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> is in effect, and
    <b>POSIX::setlocale()</b> has been called, the character used for the
    decimal separator is affected by the LC_NUMERIC locale. See perllocale and
    POSIX.</p>
<p class="Pp">As in some shells, you can enclose the variable name in braces to
    disambiguate it from following alphanumerics (and underscores). You must
    also do this when interpolating a variable into a string to separate the
    variable name from a following double-colon or an apostrophe, since these
    would be otherwise treated as a package separator:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $who = &quot;Larry&quot;;
    print PASSWD &quot;${who}::0:0:Superuser:/:/bin/perl\n&quot;;
    print &quot;We use ${who}speak when ${who}'s here.\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Without the braces, Perl would have looked for a
    <span class="Li">$whospeak</span>, a <span class="Li">$who::0</span>, and a
    <span class="Li">&quot;$who's&quot;</span> variable. The last two would be
    the <span class="Li">$0</span> and the <span class="Li">$s</span> variables
    in the (presumably) non-existent package
    <span class="Li">&quot;who&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">In fact, a simple identifier within such curlies is forced to be a
    string, and likewise within a hash subscript. Neither need quoting. Our
    earlier example, <span class="Li">$days{'Feb'}</span> can be written as
    <span class="Li">$days{Feb}</span> and the quotes will be assumed
    automatically. But anything more complicated in the subscript will be
    interpreted as an expression. This means for example that
    <span class="Li">&quot;$version{2.0}++&quot;</span> is equivalent to
    <span class="Li">&quot;$version{2}++&quot;</span>, not to
    <span class="Li">&quot;$version{'2.0'}++&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Special floating point: infinity (Inf) and not-a-number
    (NaN)</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Floating point values include the special values
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span>, for infinity and not-a-number. The
    infinity can be also negative.</p>
<p class="Pp">The infinity is the result of certain math operations that
    overflow the floating point range, like 9**9**9. The not-a-number is the
    result when the result is undefined or unrepresentable. Though note that you
    cannot get <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span> from some common
    &quot;undefined&quot; or &quot;out-of-range&quot; operations like dividing
    by zero, or square root of a negative number, since Perl generates fatal
    errors for those.</p>
<p class="Pp">The infinity and not-a-number have their own special arithmetic
    rules. The general rule is that they are &quot;contagious&quot;:
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> plus one is
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span> plus one is
    <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span>. Where things get interesting is
    when you combine infinities and not-a-numbers:
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> minus
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> divided by
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> are
    <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span> (while
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> plus
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> is
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> times
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> is
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span>).
    <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span> is also curious in that it does not
    equal any number, <i>including</i> itself:
    <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span> !=
    <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl doesn't understand <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span>
    and <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span> as numeric literals, but you can
    have them as strings, and Perl will convert them as needed: &quot;Inf&quot;
    + 1. (You can, however, import them from the POSIX extension;
    <span class="Li">&quot;use POSIX qw(Inf NaN);&quot;</span> and then use them
    as literals.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that on input (string to number) Perl accepts
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span> in many forms. Case is ignored, and
    the Win32-specific forms like <span class="Li">&quot;1.#INF&quot;</span> are
    understood, but on output the values are normalized to
    <span class="Li">&quot;Inf&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;NaN&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Version Strings</i></p>
<p class="Pp">A literal of the form
    <span class="Li">&quot;v1.20.300.4000&quot;</span> is parsed as a string
    composed of characters with the specified ordinals. This form, known as
    v-strings, provides an alternative, more readable way to construct strings,
    rather than use the somewhat less readable interpolation form
    <span class="Li">&quot;\x{1}\x{14}\x{12c}\x{fa0}&quot;</span>. This is
    useful for representing Unicode strings, and for comparing version
    &quot;numbers&quot; using the string comparison operators,
    <span class="Li">&quot;cmp&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;gt&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;lt&quot;</span> etc. If there are two or more dots in
    the literal, the leading <span class="Li">&quot;v&quot;</span> may be
    omitted.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    print v9786;              # prints SMILEY, &quot;\x{263a}&quot;
    print v102.111.111;       # prints &quot;foo&quot;
    print 102.111.111;        # same
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Such literals are accepted by both
    <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> for doing a version check. Note that
    using the v-strings for IPv4 addresses is not portable unless you also use
    the <b>inet_aton()</b>/<b>inet_ntoa()</b> routines of the Socket
  package.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that since Perl 5.8.1 the single-number v-strings (like
    <span class="Li">&quot;v65&quot;</span>) are not v-strings before the
    <span class="Li">&quot;=&gt;&quot;</span> operator (which is usually used to
    separate a hash key from a hash value); instead they are interpreted as
    literal strings ('v65'). They were v-strings from Perl 5.6.0 to Perl 5.8.0,
    but that caused more confusion and breakage than good. Multi-number
    v-strings like <span class="Li">&quot;v65.66&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">65.66.67</span> continue to be v-strings always.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Special Literals</i></p>
<p class="Pp">The special literals __FILE__, __LINE__, and __PACKAGE__ represent
    the current filename, line number, and package name at that point in your
    program. __SUB__ gives a reference to the current subroutine. They may be
    used only as separate tokens; they will not be interpolated into strings. If
    there is no current package (due to an empty
    <span class="Li">&quot;package;&quot;</span> directive), __PACKAGE__ is the
    undefined value. (But the empty <span class="Li">&quot;package;&quot;</span>
    is no longer supported, as of version 5.10.) Outside of a subroutine,
    __SUB__ is the undefined value. __SUB__ is only available in 5.16 or higher,
    and only with a <span class="Li">&quot;use v5.16&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;use feature &quot;current_sub&quot;&quot;</span>
    declaration.</p>
<p class="Pp">The two control characters ^D and ^Z, and the tokens __END__ and
    __DATA__ may be used to indicate the logical end of the script before the
    actual end of file. Any following text is ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">Text after __DATA__ may be read via the filehandle
    <span class="Li">&quot;PACKNAME::DATA&quot;</span>, where
    <span class="Li">&quot;PACKNAME&quot;</span> is the package that was current
    when the __DATA__ token was encountered. The filehandle is left open
    pointing to the line after __DATA__. The program should
    <span class="Li">&quot;close DATA&quot;</span> when it is done reading from
    it. (Leaving it open leaks filehandles if the module is reloaded for any
    reason, so it's a safer practice to close it.) For compatibility with older
    scripts written before __DATA__ was introduced, __END__ behaves like
    __DATA__ in the top level script (but not in files loaded with
    <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;do&quot;</span>) and leaves the remaining contents of
    the file accessible via <span class="Li">&quot;main::DATA&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;DATA&quot;</span> file handle by
    default has whatever PerlIO layers were in place when Perl read the file to
    parse the source. Normally that means that the file is being read bytewise,
    as if it were encoded in Latin-1, but there are two major ways for it to be
    otherwise. Firstly, if the
    <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;__DATA__&quot;</span>
    token is in the scope of a <span class="Li">&quot;use utf8&quot;</span>
    pragma then the <span class="Li">&quot;DATA&quot;</span> handle will be in
    UTF-8 mode. And secondly, if the source is being read from perl's standard
    input then the <span class="Li">&quot;DATA&quot;</span> file handle is
    actually aliased to the <span class="Li">&quot;STDIN&quot;</span> file
    handle, and may be in UTF-8 mode because of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot;</span> environment variable or
    perl's command-line switches.</p>
<p class="Pp">See SelfLoader for more description of __DATA__, and an example of
    its use. Note that you cannot read from the DATA filehandle in a BEGIN
    block: the BEGIN block is executed as soon as it is seen (during
    compilation), at which point the corresponding __DATA__ (or __END__) token
    has not yet been seen.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Barewords</i></p>
<p class="Pp">A word that has no other interpretation in the grammar will be
    treated as if it were a quoted string. These are known as
    &quot;barewords&quot;. As with filehandles and labels, a bareword that
    consists entirely of lowercase letters risks conflict with future reserved
    words, and if you use the <span class="Li">&quot;use warnings&quot;</span>
    pragma or the <b>-w</b> switch, Perl will warn you about any such words.
    Perl limits barewords (like identifiers) to about 250 characters. Future
    versions of Perl are likely to eliminate these arbitrary limitations.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some people may wish to outlaw barewords entirely. If you say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use strict 'subs';
</pre>
<p class="Pp">then any bareword that would NOT be interpreted as a subroutine
    call produces a compile-time error instead. The restriction lasts to the end
    of the enclosing block. An inner block may countermand this by saying
    <span class="Li">&quot;no strict 'subs'&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Array Interpolation</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Arrays and slices are interpolated into double-quoted strings by
    joining the elements with the delimiter specified in the
    <span class="Li">$&quot;</span> variable
    (<span class="Li">$LIST_SEPARATOR</span> if &quot;use English;&quot; is
    specified), space by default. The following are equivalent:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $temp = join($&quot;, @ARGV);
    system &quot;echo $temp&quot;;

    system &quot;echo @ARGV&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Within search patterns (which also undergo double-quotish
    substitution) there is an unfortunate ambiguity: Is
    <span class="Li">&quot;/$foo[bar]/&quot;</span> to be interpreted as
    <span class="Li">&quot;/${foo}[bar]/&quot;</span> (where
    <span class="Li">&quot;[bar]&quot;</span> is a character class for the
    regular expression) or as <span class="Li">&quot;/${foo[bar]}/&quot;</span>
    (where <span class="Li">&quot;[bar]&quot;</span> is the subscript to array
    <span class="Li">@foo</span>)? If <span class="Li">@foo</span> doesn't
    otherwise exist, then it's obviously a character class. If
    <span class="Li">@foo</span> exists, Perl takes a good guess about
    <span class="Li">&quot;[bar]&quot;</span>, and is almost always right. If it
    does guess wrong, or if you're just plain paranoid, you can force the
    correct interpretation with curly braces as above.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you're looking for the information on how to use
    here-documents, which used to be here, that's been moved to &quot;Quote and
    Quote-like Operators&quot; in perlop.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="List_value_constructors"><a class="permalink" href="#List_value_constructors">List
  value constructors</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">List values are denoted by separating individual values by commas
    (and enclosing the list in parentheses where precedence requires it):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    (LIST)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In a context not requiring a list value, the value of what appears
    to be a list literal is simply the value of the final element, as with the C
    comma operator. For example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @foo = ('cc', '-E', $bar);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">assigns the entire list value to array
    <span class="Li">@foo</span>, but</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $foo = ('cc', '-E', $bar);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">assigns the value of variable <span class="Li">$bar</span> to the
    scalar variable <span class="Li">$foo</span>. Note that the value of an
    actual array in scalar context is the length of the array; the following
    assigns the value 3 to <span class="Li">$foo:</span></p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @foo = ('cc', '-E', $bar);
    $foo = @foo;                # $foo gets 3
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You may have an optional comma before the closing parenthesis of a
    list literal, so that you can say:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @foo = (
        1,
        2,
        3,
    );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To use a here-document to assign an array, one line per element,
    you might use an approach like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @sauces = &lt;&lt;End_Lines =~ m/(\S.*\S)/g;
        normal tomato
        spicy tomato
        green chile
        pesto
        white wine
    End_Lines
</pre>
<p class="Pp">LISTs do automatic interpolation of sublists. That is, when a LIST
    is evaluated, each element of the list is evaluated in list context, and the
    resulting list value is interpolated into LIST just as if each individual
    element were a member of LIST. Thus arrays and hashes lose their identity in
    a LIST--the list</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    (@foo,@bar,&amp;SomeSub,%glarch)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">contains all the elements of <span class="Li">@foo</span> followed
    by all the elements of <span class="Li">@bar</span>, followed by all the
    elements returned by the subroutine named SomeSub called in list context,
    followed by the key/value pairs of <span class="Li">%glarch</span>. To make
    a list reference that does <i>NOT</i> interpolate, see perlref.</p>
<p class="Pp">The null list is represented by (). Interpolating it in a list has
    no effect. Thus ((),(),()) is equivalent to (). Similarly, interpolating an
    array with no elements is the same as if no array had been interpolated at
    that point.</p>
<p class="Pp">This interpolation combines with the facts that the opening and
    closing parentheses are optional (except when necessary for precedence) and
    lists may end with an optional comma to mean that multiple commas within
    lists are legal syntax. The list <span class="Li">&quot;1,,3&quot;</span> is
    a concatenation of two lists, <span class="Li">&quot;1,&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">3</span>, the first of which ends with that optional comma.
    <span class="Li">&quot;1,,3&quot;</span> is
    <span class="Li">&quot;(1,),(3)&quot;</span> is
    <span class="Li">&quot;1,3&quot;</span> (And similarly for
    <span class="Li">&quot;1,,,3&quot;</span> is
    <span class="Li">&quot;(1,),(,),3&quot;</span> is
    <span class="Li">&quot;1,3&quot;</span> and so on.) Not that we'd advise you
    to use this obfuscation.</p>
<p class="Pp">A list value may also be subscripted like a normal array. You must
    put the list in parentheses to avoid ambiguity. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    # Stat returns list value.
    $time = (stat($file))[8];

    # SYNTAX ERROR HERE.
    $time = stat($file)[8];  # OOPS, FORGOT PARENTHESES

    # Find a hex digit.
    $hexdigit = ('a','b','c','d','e','f')[$digit-10];

    # A &quot;reverse comma operator&quot;.
    return (pop(@foo),pop(@foo))[0];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Lists may be assigned to only when each element of the list is
    itself legal to assign to:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    ($x, $y, $z) = (1, 2, 3);

    ($map{'red'}, $map{'blue'}, $map{'green'}) = (0x00f, 0x0f0, 0xf00);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">An exception to this is that you may assign to
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> in a list. This is useful for
    throwing away some of the return values of a function:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    ($dev, $ino, undef, undef, $uid, $gid) = stat($file);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As of Perl 5.22, you can also use
    <span class="Li">&quot;(undef)x2&quot;</span> instead of
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef, undef&quot;</span>. (You can also do
    <span class="Li">&quot;($x) x 2&quot;</span>, which is less useful, because
    it assigns to the same variable twice, clobbering the first value
  assigned.)</p>
<p class="Pp">When you assign a list of scalars to an array, all previous values
    in that array are wiped out and the number of elements in the array will now
    be equal to the number of elements in the right-hand list -- the list from
    which assignment was made. The array will automatically resize itself to
    precisely accommodate each element in the right-hand list.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use warnings;
    my (@xyz, $x, $y, $z);

    @xyz = (1, 2, 3);
    print &quot;@xyz\n&quot;;                             # 1 2 3

    @xyz = ('al', 'be', 'ga', 'de');
    print &quot;@xyz\n&quot;;                             # al be ga de

    @xyz = (101, 102);
    print &quot;@xyz\n&quot;;                             # 101 102
</pre>
<p class="Pp">When, however, you assign a list of scalars to another list of
    scalars, the results differ according to whether the left-hand list -- the
    list being assigned to -- has the same, more or fewer elements than the
    right-hand list.</p>

<p class="Pp">If the number of scalars in the left-hand list is less than that

<p class="Pp">List assignment in scalar context returns the number of elements
    produced by the expression on the right side of the assignment:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $x = (($foo,$bar) = (3,2,1));       # set $x to 3, not 2
    $x = (($foo,$bar) = f());           # set $x to f()'s return count
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is handy when you want to do a list assignment in a Boolean
    context, because most list functions return a null list when finished, which
    when assigned produces a 0, which is interpreted as FALSE.</p>
<p class="Pp">It's also the source of a useful idiom for executing a function or
    performing an operation in list context and then counting the number of
    return values, by assigning to an empty list and then using that assignment
    in scalar context. For example, this code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $count = () = $string =~ /\d+/g;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will place into <span class="Li">$count</span> the number of digit
    groups found in <span class="Li">$string</span>. This happens because the
    pattern match is in list context (since it is being assigned to the empty
    list), and will therefore return a list of all matching parts of the string.
    The list assignment in scalar context will translate that into the number of
    elements (here, the number of times the pattern matched) and assign that to
    <span class="Li">$count</span>. Note that simply using</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $count = $string =~ /\d+/g;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">would not have worked, since a pattern match in scalar context
    will only return true or false, rather than a count of matches.</p>
<p class="Pp">The final element of a list assignment may be an array or a
  hash:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    ($x, $y, @rest) = split;
    my($x, $y, %rest) = @_;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can actually put an array or hash anywhere in the list, but
    the first one in the list will soak up all the values, and anything after it
    will become undefined. This may be useful in a <b>my()</b> or
    <b>local()</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">A hash can be initialized using a literal list holding pairs of
    items to be interpreted as a key and a value:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    # same as map assignment above
    %map = ('red',0x00f,'blue',0x0f0,'green',0xf00);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">While literal lists and named arrays are often interchangeable,
    that's not the case for hashes. Just because you can subscript a list value
    like a normal array does not mean that you can subscript a list value as a
    hash. Likewise, hashes included as parts of other lists (including
    parameters lists and return lists from functions) always flatten out into
    key/value pairs. That's why it's good to use references sometimes.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is often more readable to use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;=&gt;&quot;</span> operator between key/value pairs.
    The <span class="Li">&quot;=&gt;&quot;</span> operator is mostly just a more
    visually distinctive synonym for a comma, but it also arranges for its
    left-hand operand to be interpreted as a string if it's a bareword that
    would be a legal simple identifier.
    <span class="Li">&quot;=&gt;&quot;</span> doesn't quote compound
    identifiers, that contain double colons. This makes it nice for initializing
    hashes:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    %map = (
                 red   =&gt; 0x00f,
                 blue  =&gt; 0x0f0,
                 green =&gt; 0xf00,
   );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or for initializing hash references to be used as records:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $rec = {
                witch =&gt; 'Mable the Merciless',
                cat   =&gt; 'Fluffy the Ferocious',
                date  =&gt; '10/31/1776',
    };
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or for using call-by-named-parameter to complicated functions:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
   $field = $query-&gt;radio_group(
               name      =&gt; 'group_name',
               values    =&gt; ['eenie','meenie','minie'],
               default   =&gt; 'meenie',
               linebreak =&gt; 'true',
               labels    =&gt; \%labels
   );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that just because a hash is initialized in that order doesn't
    mean that it comes out in that order. See &quot;sort&quot; in perlfunc for
    examples of how to arrange for an output ordering.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a key appears more than once in the initializer list of a hash,
    the last occurrence wins:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    %circle = (
                  center =&gt; [5, 10],
                  center =&gt; [27, 9],
                  radius =&gt; 100,
                  color =&gt; [0xDF, 0xFF, 0x00],
                  radius =&gt; 54,
    );

    # same as
    %circle = (
                  center =&gt; [27, 9],
                  color =&gt; [0xDF, 0xFF, 0x00],
                  radius =&gt; 54,
    );
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This can be used to provide overridable configuration
  defaults:</p>

    # values in %args take priority over %config_defaults
    %config = (%config_defaults, %args);

<h2 class="Ss" id="Subscripts"><a class="permalink" href="#Subscripts">Subscripts</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">An array can be accessed one scalar at a time by specifying a
    dollar sign (<span class="Li">&quot;$&quot;</span>), then the name of the
    array (without the leading <span class="Li">&quot;@&quot;</span>), then the
    subscript inside square brackets. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @myarray = (5, 50, 500, 5000);
    print &quot;The Third Element is&quot;, $myarray[2], &quot;\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The array indices start with 0. A negative subscript retrieves its
    value from the end. In our example, <span class="Li">$myarray[-1]</span>
    would have been 5000, and <span class="Li">$myarray[-2]</span> would have
    been 500.</p>
<p class="Pp">Hash subscripts are similar, only instead of square brackets curly
    brackets are used. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    %scientists = 
    (
        &quot;Newton&quot; =&gt; &quot;Isaac&quot;,
        &quot;Einstein&quot; =&gt; &quot;Albert&quot;,
        &quot;Darwin&quot; =&gt; &quot;Charles&quot;,
        &quot;Feynman&quot; =&gt; &quot;Richard&quot;,
    );

    print &quot;Darwin's First Name is &quot;, $scientists{&quot;Darwin&quot;}, &quot;\n&quot;;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You can also subscript a list to get a single element from it:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $dir = (getpwnam(&quot;daemon&quot;))[7];
</pre>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Multi-dimensional_array_emulation"><a class="permalink" href="#Multi-dimensional_array_emulation">Multi-dimensional

<h2 class="Ss" id="Slices"><a class="permalink" href="#Slices">Slices</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A slice accesses several elements of a list, an array, or a hash
    simultaneously using a list of subscripts. It's more convenient than writing
    out the individual elements as a list of separate scalar values.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    ($him, $her)   = @folks[0,-1];              # array slice
    @them          = @folks[0 .. 3];            # array slice
    ($who, $home)  = @ENV{&quot;USER&quot;, &quot;HOME&quot;};      # hash slice
    ($uid, $dir)   = (getpwnam(&quot;daemon&quot;))[2,7]; # list slice
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Since you can assign to a list of variables, you can also assign
    to an array or hash slice.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @days[3..5]    = qw/Wed Thu Fri/;
    @colors{'red','blue','green'} 
                   = (0xff0000, 0x0000ff, 0x00ff00);
    @folks[0, -1]  = @folks[-1, 0];
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The previous assignments are exactly equivalent to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    ($days[3], $days[4], $days[5]) = qw/Wed Thu Fri/;
    ($colors{'red'}, $colors{'blue'}, $colors{'green'})
                   = (0xff0000, 0x0000ff, 0x00ff00);
    ($folks[0], $folks[-1]) = ($folks[-1], $folks[0]);
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Since changing a slice changes the original array or hash that
    it's slicing, a <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> construct will
    alter some--or even all--of the values of the array or hash.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    foreach (@array[ 4 .. 10 ]) { s/peter/paul/ } 

    foreach (@hash{qw[key1 key2]}) {
        s/^\s+//;           # trim leading whitespace
        s/\s+$//;           # trim trailing whitespace
        s/(\w+)/\u\L$1/g;   # &quot;titlecase&quot; words
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As a special exception, when you slice a list (but not an array or
    a hash), if the list evaluates to empty, then taking a slice of that empty
    list will always yield the empty list in turn. Thus:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @a = ()[0,1];          # @a has no elements
    @b = (@a)[0,1];        # @b has no elements
    @c = (sub{}-&gt;())[0,1]; # @c has no elements
    @d = ('a','b')[0,1];   # @d has two elements
    @e = (@d)[0,1,8,9];    # @e has four elements
    @f = (@d)[8,9];        # @f has two elements
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This makes it easy to write loops that terminate when a null list
    is returned:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    while ( ($home, $user) = (getpwent)[7,0] ) {
        printf &quot;%-8s %s\n&quot;, $user, $home;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As noted earlier in this document, the scalar sense of list
    assignment is the number of elements on the right-hand side of the
    assignment. The null list contains no elements, so when the password file is
    exhausted, the result is 0, not 2.</p>
<p class="Pp">Slices in scalar context return the last item of the slice.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @a = qw/first second third/;
    %h = (first =&gt; 'A', second =&gt; 'B');
    $t = @a[0, 1];                  # $t is now 'second'
    $u = @h{'first', 'second'};     # $u is now 'B'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If you're confused about why you use an '@' there on a hash slice
    instead of a '%', think of it like this. The type of bracket (square or
    curly) governs whether it's an array or a hash being looked at. On the other
    hand, the leading symbol ('$' or '@') on the array or hash indicates whether
    you are getting back a singular value (a scalar) or a plural one (a
  list).</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Key/Value Hash Slices</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Starting in Perl 5.20, a hash slice operation with the % symbol is
    a variant of slice operation returning a list of key/value pairs rather than
    just values:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    %h = (blonk =&gt; 2, foo =&gt; 3, squink =&gt; 5, bar =&gt; 8);
    %subset = %h{'foo', 'bar'}; # key/value hash slice
    # %subset is now (foo =&gt; 3, bar =&gt; 8)
    %removed = delete %h{'foo', 'bar'};
    # %removed is now (foo =&gt; 3, bar =&gt; 8)
    # %h is now (blonk =&gt; 2, squink =&gt; 5)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">However, the result of such a slice cannot be localized or used in
    assignment. These are otherwise very much consistent with hash slices using
    the @ symbol.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Index/Value Array Slices</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Similar to key/value hash slices (and also introduced in Perl
    5.20), the % array slice syntax returns a list of index/value pairs:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @a = &quot;a&quot;..&quot;z&quot;;
    @list = %a[3,4,6];
    # @list is now (3, &quot;d&quot;, 4, &quot;e&quot;, 6, &quot;g&quot;)
    @removed = delete %a[3,4,6]
    # @removed is now (3, &quot;d&quot;, 4, &quot;e&quot;, 6, &quot;g&quot;)
    # @list[3,4,6] are now undef
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that calling <span class="Li">&quot;delete&quot;</span> on
    array values is strongly discouraged.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Typeglobs_and_Filehandles"><a class="permalink" href="#Typeglobs_and_Filehandles">Typeglobs
  and Filehandles</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl uses an internal type called a <i>typeglob</i> to hold an
    entire symbol table entry. The type prefix of a typeglob is a
    <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>, because it represents all types. This
    used to be the preferred way to pass arrays and hashes by reference into a
    function, but now that we have real references, this is seldom needed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The main use of typeglobs in modern Perl is create symbol table
    aliases. This assignment:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    *this = *that;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">makes <span class="Li">$this</span> an alias for
    <span class="Li">$that</span>, <span class="Li">@this</span> an alias for
    <span class="Li">@that</span>, <span class="Li">%this</span> an alias for
    <span class="Li">%that</span>, &amp;this an alias for &amp;that, etc. Much
    safer is to use a reference. This:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    local *Here::blue = \$There::green;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">temporarily makes <span class="Li">$Here::blue</span> an alias for
    <span class="Li">$There::green</span>, but doesn't make
    <span class="Li">@Here::blue</span> an alias for
    <span class="Li">@There::green</span>, or
    <span class="Li">%Here::blue</span> an alias for
    <span class="Li">%There::green</span>, etc. See &quot;Symbol Tables&quot; in
    perlmod for more examples of this. Strange though this may seem, this is the
    basis for the whole module import/export system.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another use for typeglobs is to pass filehandles into a function
    or to create new filehandles. If you need to use a typeglob to save away a
    filehandle, do it this way:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $fh = *STDOUT;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or perhaps as a real reference, like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $fh = \*STDOUT;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">See perlsub for examples of using these as indirect filehandles in
    functions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Typeglobs are also a way to create a local filehandle using the
    <b>local()</b> operator. These last until their block is exited, but may be
    passed back. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    sub newopen {
        my $path = shift;
        local  *FH;  # not my!
        open   (FH, $path)          or  return undef;
        return *FH;
    }
    $fh = newopen('/etc/passwd');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Now that we have the <span class="Li">*foo{THING}</span> notation,
    typeglobs aren't used as much for filehandle manipulations, although they're
    still needed to pass brand new file and directory handles into or out of
    functions. That's because <span class="Li">*HANDLE{IO}</span> only works if
    HANDLE has already been used as a handle. In other words,
    <span class="Li">*FH</span> must be used to create new symbol table entries;
    <span class="Li">*foo{THING}</span> cannot. When in doubt, use
    <span class="Li">*FH</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">All functions that are capable of creating filehandles
    (<b>open()</b>, <b>opendir()</b>, <b>pipe()</b>, <b>socketpair()</b>,
    <b>sysopen()</b>, <b>socket()</b>, and <b>accept()</b>) automatically create
    an anonymous filehandle if the handle passed to them is an uninitialized
    scalar variable. This allows the constructs such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;open(my $fh, ...)&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;open(local $fh,...)&quot;</span> to be used to create
    filehandles that will conveniently be closed automatically when the scope
    ends, provided there are no other references to them. This largely
    eliminates the need for typeglobs when opening filehandles that must be
    passed around, as in the following example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    sub myopen {
        open my $fh, &quot;@_&quot;
             or die &quot;Can't open '@_': $!&quot;;
        return $fh;
    }

    {
        my $f = myopen(&quot;&lt;/etc/motd&quot;);
        print &lt;$f&gt;;
        # $f implicitly closed here
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that if an initialized scalar variable is used instead the
    result is different: <span class="Li">&quot;my $fh='zzz'; open($fh,
    ...)&quot;</span> is equivalent to <span class="Li">&quot;open( *{'zzz'},
    ...)&quot;</span>. <span class="Li">&quot;use strict 'refs'&quot;</span>
    forbids such practice.</p>
<p class="Pp">Another way to create anonymous filehandles is with the Symbol
    module or with the IO::Handle module and its ilk. These modules have the
    advantage of not hiding different types of the same name during the
    <b>local()</b>. See the bottom of &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc for an
    example.</p>
