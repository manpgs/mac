<p class="Pp">This document describes differences between the 5.003 release (as

  Environments</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Perl5.004 builds out of the box on Unix, Plan 9, LynxOS, VMS,
    OS/2, QNX, AmigaOS, and Windows NT. Perl runs on Windows 95 as well, but it
    cannot be built there, for lack of a reasonable command interpreter.</p>

  option: Binary compatibility with 5.003</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">There is a new Configure question that asks if you want to
    maintain binary compatibility with Perl 5.003. If you choose binary
    compatibility, you do not have to recompile your extensions, but you might
    have symbol conflicts if you embed Perl in another application, just as in
    the 5.003 release. By default, binary compatibility is preserved at the
    expense of symbol table pollution.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="$PERL5OPT_environment_variable"><a class="permalink" href="#$PERL5OPT_environment_variable">$PERL5OPT
  environment variable</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You may now put Perl options in the
    <span class="Li">$PERL5OPT</span> environment variable. Unless Perl is
    running with taint checks, it will interpret this variable as if its
    contents had appeared on a &quot;#!perl&quot; line at the beginning of your
    script, except that hyphens are optional. PERL5OPT may only be used to set
    the following switches: <b>-[DIMUdmw]</b>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Limitations_on_"><a class="permalink" href="#Limitations_on_">Limitations
  on <b>-M</b>, <b>-m</b>, and <b>-T</b> options</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;-M&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;-m&quot;</span> options are no longer allowed on the
    <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line of a script. If a script needs a
    module, it should invoke it with the <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>
    pragma.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-T</b> option is also forbidden on the
    <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line of a script, unless it was
    present on the Perl command line. Due to the way
    <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> works, this usually means that
    <b>-T</b> must be in the first argument. Thus:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -T -w
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will probably work for an executable script invoked as
    <span class="Li">&quot;scriptname&quot;</span>, while:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w -T
</pre>
<p class="Pp">will probably fail under the same conditions. (Non-Unix systems
    will probably not follow this rule.) But <span class="Li">&quot;perl
    scriptname&quot;</span> is guaranteed to fail, since then there is no chance
    of <b>-T</b> being found on the command line before it is found on the
    <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="More_precise_warnings"><a class="permalink" href="#More_precise_warnings">More
  precise warnings</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">If you removed the <b>-w</b> option from your Perl 5.003 scripts
    because it made Perl too verbose, we recommend that you try putting it back
    when you upgrade to Perl 5.004. Each new perl version tends to remove some
    undesirable warnings, while adding new warnings that may catch bugs in your
    scripts.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Deprecated:_Inherited__AUTOLOAD__for_non-methods"><a class="permalink" href="#Deprecated:_Inherited__AUTOLOAD__for_non-methods">Deprecated:
  Inherited &quot;AUTOLOAD&quot; for non-methods</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Before Perl 5.004, <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span>
    functions were looked up as methods (using the <span class="Li">@ISA</span>
    hierarchy), even when the function to be autoloaded was called as a plain
    function (e.g. <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::bar()&quot;</span>), not a method
    (e.g. <span class="Li">&quot;Foo-&gt;bar()&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;$obj-&gt;bar()&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl 5.005 will use method lookup only for methods'
    <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span>s. However, there is a
    significant base of existing code that may be using the old behavior. So, as
    an interim step, Perl 5.004 issues an optional warning when a non-method
    uses an inherited <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The simple rule is: Inheritance will not work when autoloading
    non-methods. The simple fix for old code is: In any module that used to
    depend on inheriting <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> for
    non-methods from a base class named
    <span class="Li">&quot;BaseClass&quot;</span>, execute
    <span class="Li">&quot;*AUTOLOAD = \&amp;BaseClass::AUTOLOAD&quot;</span>
    during startup.</p>

  deprecated %OVERLOAD is no longer usable</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Using <span class="Li">%OVERLOAD</span> to define overloading was
    deprecated in 5.003. Overloading is now defined using the overload pragma.
    <span class="Li">%OVERLOAD</span> is still used internally but should not be
    used by Perl scripts. See overload for more details.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Subroutine_arguments_created_only_when_they're_modified"><a class="permalink" href="#Subroutine_arguments_created_only_when_they're_modified">Subroutine
  arguments created only when they're modified</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In Perl 5.004, nonexistent array and hash elements used as
    subroutine parameters are brought into existence only if they are actually
    assigned to (via <span class="Li">@_</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Earlier versions of Perl vary in their handling of such arguments.
    Perl versions 5.002 and 5.003 always brought them into existence. Perl
    versions 5.000 and 5.001 brought them into existence only if they were not
    the first argument (which was almost certainly a bug). Earlier versions of
    Perl never brought them into existence.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, given this code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
     undef @a; undef %a;
     sub show { print $_[0] };
     sub change { $_[0]++ };
     show($a[2]);
     change($a{b});
</pre>
<p class="Pp">After this code executes in Perl 5.004,
    <span class="Li">$a</span>{b} exists but <span class="Li">$a</span>[2] does
    not. In Perl 5.002 and 5.003, both <span class="Li">$a</span>{b} and
    <span class="Li">$a</span>[2] would have existed (but
    <span class="Li">$a</span>[2]'s value would have been undefined).</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Group_vector_changeable_with_$)"><a class="permalink" href="#Group_vector_changeable_with_$)">Group
  vector changeable with $)</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">$)</span> special variable has always (well,
    in Perl 5, at least) reflected not only the current effective group, but
    also the group list as returned by the
    <span class="Li">&quot;getgroups()&quot;</span> C function (if there is
    one). However, until this release, there has not been a way to call the
    <span class="Li">&quot;setgroups()&quot;</span> C function from Perl.</p>
<p class="Pp">In Perl 5.004, assigning to <span class="Li">$)</span> is exactly
    symmetrical with examining it: The first number in its string value is used
    as the effective gid; if there are any numbers after the first one, they are
    passed to the <span class="Li">&quot;setgroups()&quot;</span> C function (if
    there is one).</p>

  parsing of $$&lt;digit&gt;, &amp;$&lt;digit&gt;, etc.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl versions before 5.004 misinterpreted any type marker followed
    by &quot;$&quot; and a digit. For example, &quot;$$0&quot; was incorrectly
    taken to mean &quot;${$}0&quot; instead of &quot;${$0}&quot;. This bug is
    (mostly) fixed in Perl 5.004.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, the developers of Perl 5.004 could not fix this bug
    completely, because at least two widely-used modules depend on the old
    meaning of &quot;$$0&quot; in a string. So Perl 5.004 still interprets
    &quot;$$&lt;digit&gt;&quot; in the old (broken) way inside strings; but it
    generates this message as a warning. And in Perl 5.005, this special
    treatment will cease.</p>

  localization of $&lt;digit&gt;, $&amp;, etc.</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl versions before 5.004 did not always properly localize the
    regex-related special variables. Perl 5.004 does localize them, as the
    documentation has always said it should. This may result in
    <span class="Li">$1</span>, <span class="Li">$2</span>, etc. no longer being
    set where existing programs use them.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="No_resetting_of_$._on_implicit_close"><a class="permalink" href="#No_resetting_of_$._on_implicit_close">No
  resetting of $. on implicit close</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The documentation for Perl 5.0 has always stated that
    <span class="Li">$.</span> is <i>not</i> reset when an already-open file
    handle is reopened with no intervening call to
    <span class="Li">&quot;close&quot;</span>. Due to a bug, perl versions 5.000
    through 5.003 <i>did</i> reset <span class="Li">$.</span> under that
    circumstance; Perl 5.004 does not.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="_wantarray__may_return_undef"><a class="permalink" href="#_wantarray__may_return_undef">&quot;wantarray&quot;
  may return undef</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;wantarray&quot;</span> operator returns
    true if a subroutine is expected to return a list, and false otherwise. In
    Perl 5.004, <span class="Li">&quot;wantarray&quot;</span> can also return
    the undefined value if a subroutine's return value will not be used at all,
    which allows subroutines to avoid a time-consuming calculation of a return
    value if it isn't going to be used.</p>

  EXPR&quot; determines value of EXPR in scalar context</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Perl (version 5) used to determine the value of EXPR
    inconsistently, sometimes incorrectly using the surrounding context for the
    determination. Now, the value of EXPR (before being parsed by eval) is
    always determined in a scalar context. Once parsed, it is executed as
    before, by providing the context that the scope surrounding the eval
    provided. This change makes the behavior Perl4 compatible, besides fixing
    bugs resulting from the inconsistent behavior. This program:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    @a = qw(time now is time);
    print eval @a;
    print '|', scalar eval @a;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">used to print something like &quot;timenowis881399109|4&quot;, but
    now (and in perl4) prints &quot;4|4&quot;.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Changes_to_tainting_checks"><a class="permalink" href="#Changes_to_tainting_checks">Changes
  to tainting checks</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A bug in previous versions may have failed to detect some insecure
    conditions when taint checks are turned on. (Taint checks are used in setuid
    or setgid scripts, or when explicitly turned on with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-T&quot;</span> invocation option.) Although it's
    unlikely, this may cause a previously-working script to now fail, which
    should be construed as a blessing since that indicates a potentially-serious
    security hole was just plugged.</p>
<p class="Pp">The new restrictions when tainting include:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="No"><a class="permalink" href="#No">No <i>glob()</i> or
    &lt;*&gt;</a></dt>
  <dd>These operators may spawn the C shell (csh), which cannot be made safe.
      This restriction will be lifted in a future version of Perl when globbing
      is implemented without the use of an external program.</dd>
  <dt id="No~2"><a class="permalink" href="#No~2">No spawning if tainted
    $CDPATH, $ENV, $BASH_ENV</a></dt>
  <dd>These environment variables may alter the behavior of spawned programs
      (especially shells) in ways that subvert security. So now they are treated
      as dangerous, in the manner of <span class="Li">$IFS</span> and
      <span class="Li">$PATH</span>.</dd>
  <dt id="No~3"><a class="permalink" href="#No~3">No spawning if tainted $TERM
    doesn't look like a terminal name</a></dt>
  <dd>Some termcap libraries do unsafe things with
      <span class="Li">$TERM</span>. However, it would be unnecessarily harsh to
      treat all <span class="Li">$TERM</span> values as unsafe, since only shell
      metacharacters can cause trouble in <span class="Li">$TERM</span>. So a
      tainted <span class="Li">$TERM</span> is considered to be safe if it
      contains only alphanumerics, underscores, dashes, and colons, and unsafe
      if it contains other characters (including whitespace).</dd>

<p class="Pp">File handles are now stored internally as type IO::Handle. The

      increase the number of hash buckets allocated for the given hash. This can
      gain you a measure of efficiency if you know the hash is going to get big.
      (This is similar to pre-extending an array by assigning a larger number to
      $#array.) If you say
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    keys %hash = 200;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">then <span class="Li">%hash</span> will have at least 200
        buckets allocated for it. These buckets will be retained even if you do
        <span class="Li">&quot;%hash = ()&quot;</span>; use
        <span class="Li">&quot;undef</span> <span class="Li">%hash&quot;</span>
        if you want to free the storage while <span class="Li">%hash</span> is
        still in scope. You can't shrink the number of buckets allocated for the
        hash using <span class="Li">&quot;keys&quot;</span> in this way (but you
        needn't worry about doing this by accident, as trying has no

  <dt id="use"><a class="permalink" href="#use">use VERSION</a></dt>
  <dd>If the first argument to <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> is a
      number, it is treated as a version number instead of a module name. If the
      version of the Perl interpreter is less than VERSION, then an error
      message is printed and Perl exits immediately. Because
      <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span> occurs at compile time, this check
      happens immediately during the compilation process, unlike
      <span class="Li">&quot;require VERSION&quot;</span>, which waits until
      runtime for the check. This is often useful if you need to check the
      current Perl version before <span class="Li">&quot;use&quot;</span>ing
      library modules which have changed in incompatible ways from older
      versions of Perl. (We try not to do this more than we have to.)</dd>

  <dd>If the VERSION argument is present between Module and LIST, then the

      larger than the value of the variable
      <span class="Li">$Module::VERSION</span>. (Note that there is not a comma
      after VERSION!)
    <p class="Pp">This version-checking mechanism is similar to the one
        currently used in the Exporter module, but it is faster and can be used

  <dd>The default seed for <span class="Li">&quot;srand&quot;</span>, which used

      a heady mix of difficult-to-predict system-dependent values, which should
      be sufficient for most everyday purposes.
    <p class="Pp">Previous to version 5.004, calling
        <span class="Li">&quot;rand&quot;</span> without first calling
        <span class="Li">&quot;srand&quot;</span> would yield the same sequence

        you're calling <span class="Li">&quot;rand&quot;</span> and haven't yet
        called <span class="Li">&quot;srand&quot;</span>, it calls
        <span class="Li">&quot;srand&quot;</span> with the default seed. You
        should still call <span class="Li">&quot;srand&quot;</span> manually if
        your code might ever be run on a pre-5.004 system, of course, or if you

  <dt>&quot;m//gc&quot; does not reset search position on failure</dt>

      as a result, the next <span class="Li">&quot;m//g&quot;</span> match after
      a failure starts again at the beginning of the string. With Perl 5.004,
      this reset may be disabled by adding the &quot;c&quot; (for
      &quot;continue&quot;) modifier, i.e.
      <span class="Li">&quot;m//gc&quot;</span>. This feature, in conjunction

  <dt>&quot;m//x&quot; ignores whitespace before ?*+{}</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;m//x&quot;</span> construct has always been
      intended to ignore all unescaped whitespace. However, before Perl 5.004,
      whitespace had the effect of escaping repeat modifiers like &quot;*&quot;
      or &quot;?&quot;; for example, <span class="Li">&quot;/a *b/x&quot;</span>
      was (mis)interpreted as <span class="Li">&quot;/a\*b/x&quot;</span>. This

  <dt id="DPACK_MALLOC"><a class="permalink" href="#DPACK_MALLOC">-DPACK_MALLOC</a></dt>
  <dd>Perl memory allocation is by bucket with sizes close to powers of two.
      Because of these malloc overhead may be big, especially for data of size
      exactly a power of two. If <span class="Li">&quot;PACK_MALLOC&quot;</span>
      is defined, perl uses a slightly different algorithm for small allocations
      (up to 64 bytes long), which makes it possible to have overhead down to 1
      byte for allocations which are powers of two (and appear quite often).
    <p class="Pp">Expected memory savings (with 8-byte alignment in
        <span class="Li">&quot;alignbytes&quot;</span>) is about 20% for typical

      are typical for big hashes and special-purpose scripts, especially image
      processing.
    <p class="Pp">On recent systems, the fact that perl requires 2M from system
        for 1M allocation will not affect speed of execution, since the tail of
        such a chunk is not going to be touched (and thus will not require real
        memory). However, it may result in a premature out-of-memory error. So

      builtin operations.
    <p class="Pp">When <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> is in
        effect, the current LC_CTYPE locale is used for regular expressions and
        case mapping; LC_COLLATE for string ordering; and LC_NUMERIC for numeric
        formatting in printf and sprintf (but <b>not</b> in print). LC_NUMERIC
        is always used in write, since lexical scoping of formats is problematic
        at best.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Each <span class="Li">&quot;use locale&quot;</span> or
        <span class="Li">&quot;no locale&quot;</span> affects statements to the
        end of the enclosing BLOCK or, if not inside a BLOCK, to the end of the

<p class="Pp">Also, the majordomo mailing list program, version 1.94.1, doesn't

  <dt>&quot;void&quot; XSUBs now default to returning nothing</dt>
  <dd>Due to a documentation/implementation bug in previous versions of Perl,
      XSUBs with a return type of <span class="Li">&quot;void&quot;</span> have
      actually been returning one value. Usually that value was the GV for the
      XSUB, but sometimes it was some already freed or reused value, which would
      sometimes lead to program failure.
    <p class="Pp">In Perl 5.004, if an XSUB is declared as returning
        <span class="Li">&quot;void&quot;</span>, it actually returns no value,
        i.e. an empty list (though there is a backward-compatibility exception;
        see below). If your XSUB really does return an SV, you should give it a
        return type of <span class="Li">&quot;SV *&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For backward compatibility, <i>xsubpp</i> tries to guess
        whether a <span class="Li">&quot;void&quot;</span> XSUB is really
        <span class="Li">&quot;void&quot;</span> or if it wants to return an
        <span class="Li">&quot;SV *&quot;</span>. It does so by examining the
        text of the XSUB: if <i>xsubpp</i> finds what looks like an assignment
        to <span class="Li">ST(0)</span>, it assumes that the XSUB's return type
        is really <span class="Li">&quot;SV *&quot;</span>.</p>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;gv_fetchmethod&quot; and &quot;perl_call_sv&quot;</dt>
  <dd>The <span class="Li">&quot;gv_fetchmethod&quot;</span> function finds a
      method for an object, just like in Perl 5.003. The GV it returns may be a
      method cache entry. However, in Perl 5.004, method cache entries are not
      visible to users; therefore, they can no longer be passed directly to
      <span class="Li">&quot;perl_call_sv&quot;</span>. Instead, you should use
      the <span class="Li">&quot;GvCV&quot;</span> macro on the GV to extract
      its CV, and pass the CV to
      <span class="Li">&quot;perl_call_sv&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">The most likely symptom of passing the result of
        <span class="Li">&quot;gv_fetchmethod&quot;</span> to
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl_call_sv&quot;</span> is Perl's producing an

  <dt>&quot;perl_eval_pv&quot;</dt>
  <dd>A new function handy for eval'ing strings of Perl code inside C code. This

  <dt id="Extended"><a class="permalink" href="#Extended">Extended API for
    manipulating hashes</a></dt>
  <dd>Internal handling of hash keys has changed. The old hashtable API is still
      fully supported, and will likely remain so. The additions to the API allow
      passing keys as <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span>s, so that
      <span class="Li">&quot;tied&quot;</span> hashes can be given real scalars
      as keys rather than plain strings (nontied hashes still can only use
      strings as keys). New extensions must use the new hash access functions
      and macros if they wish to use <span class="Li">&quot;SV*&quot;</span>
      keys. These additions also make it feasible to manipulate
      <span class="Li">&quot;HE*&quot;</span>s (hash entries), which can be more
      efficient. See perlguts for details.</dd>

      typographical error. Note that the earlier variable will still exist until
      the end of the scope or until all closure referents to it are
    destroyed.</dd>
  <dt>%s argument is not a HASH element or slice</dt>
  <dd>(F) The argument to <i>delete()</i> must be either a hash element, such as

  <dt id="Applying"><a class="permalink" href="#Applying">Applying %s to %s will
    act on scalar(%s)</a></dt>
  <dd>(W) The pattern match (//), substitution (s///), and transliteration
      (tr///) operators work on scalar values. If you apply one of them to an
      array or a hash, it will convert the array or hash to a scalar value (the
      length of an array or the population info of a hash) and then work on that
      scalar value. This is probably not what you meant to do. See

      alternatives.</dd>
  <dt id="Attempt"><a class="permalink" href="#Attempt">Attempt to free
    nonexistent shared string</a></dt>
  <dd>(P) Perl maintains a reference counted internal table of strings to

  <dt id="Bareword"><a class="permalink" href="#Bareword">Bareword
    &quot;%s&quot; refers to nonexistent package</a></dt>
  <dd>(W) You used a qualified bareword of the form
      <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::&quot;</span>, but the compiler saw no other

  <dt id="Can't"><a class="permalink" href="#Can't">Can't redefine active sort

  <dd>(F) Perl optimizes the internal handling of sort subroutines and keeps
      pointers into them. You tried to redefine one such sort subroutine when it
      was currently active, which is not allowed. If you really want to do this,
      you should write <span class="Li">&quot;sort { &amp;func } @x&quot;</span>

      Constructor&quot; in overload.</dd>
  <dt id="Died"><a class="permalink" href="#Died">Died</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) You passed <i>die()</i> an empty string (the equivalent of

  <dt id="Exiting"><a class="permalink" href="#Exiting">Exiting pseudo-block via

  <dd>(W) You are exiting a rather special block construct (like a sort block or

      statement. See &quot;sort&quot; in perlfunc.</dd>
  <dt id="Identifier"><a class="permalink" href="#Identifier">Identifier too
    long</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl limits identifiers (names for variables, functions, etc.) to 252
      characters for simple names, somewhat more for compound names (like
      <span class="Li">$A::B</span>). You've exceeded Perl's limits. Future
      versions of Perl are likely to eliminate these arbitrary limitations.</dd>
  <dt id="Illegal"><a class="permalink" href="#Illegal">Illegal character %s
    (carriage return)</a></dt>
  <dd>(F) A carriage return character was found in the input. This is an error,
      and not a warning, because carriage return characters can break multi-line

      as if it were csh (e.g.

        it depends on the way Perl was compiled. By default it is not trappable.

  <dd>(W) <i>qw()</i> lists contain items separated by whitespace; as with

      treated as literal data. (You may have used different delimiters than the

  <dd>(W) You've used a hash slice (indicated by @) to select a single element
      of a hash. Generally it's better to ask for a scalar value (indicated by
      $). The difference is that <span class="Li">$foo{&amp;bar}</span> always
      behaves like a scalar, both when assigning to it and when evaluating its
      argument, while <span class="Li">@foo{&amp;bar}</span> behaves like a list
      when you assign to it, and provides a list context to its subscript, which
      can do weird things if you're expecting only one subscript.</dd>

  <dd>(P) Overloading resolution over <span class="Li">@ISA</span> tree may be

  <dd>(X) The #! line (or local equivalent) in a Perl script contains the

      list. This is an error because, by the time Perl discovers a <b>-T</b> in
      a script, it's too late to properly taint everything from the environment.
      So Perl gives up.</dd>

  <dd>(D) Perl versions before 5.004 misinterpreted any type marker followed by
      &quot;$&quot; and a digit. For example, &quot;$$0&quot; was incorrectly
      taken to mean &quot;${$}0&quot; instead of &quot;${$0}&quot;. This bug is
      (mostly) fixed in Perl 5.004.
    <p class="Pp">However, the developers of Perl 5.004 could not fix this bug
        completely, because at least two widely-used modules depend on the old
        meaning of &quot;$$0&quot; in a string. So Perl 5.004 still interprets
        &quot;$$&lt;digit&gt;&quot; in the old (broken) way inside strings; but
        it generates this message as a warning. And in Perl 5.005, this special

  <dt id="Value"><a class="permalink" href="#Value">Value of %s can be

      <span class="Li">&quot;readdir()&quot;</span> as a boolean value. Each of
      these constructs can return a value of &quot;0&quot;; that would make the
      conditional expression false, which is probably not what you intended.
      When using these constructs in conditional expressions, test their values
      with the <span class="Li">&quot;defined&quot;</span> operator.</dd>
  <dt id="Variable"><a class="permalink" href="#Variable">Variable
    &quot;%s&quot; may be unavailable</a></dt>
  <dd>(W) An inner (nested) <i>anonymous</i> subroutine is inside a <i>named</i>
      subroutine, and outside that is another subroutine; and the anonymous
      (innermost) subroutine is referencing a lexical variable defined in the
      outermost subroutine. For example:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
   sub outermost { my $a; sub middle { sub { $a } } }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the anonymous subroutine is called or referenced (directly
        or indirectly) from the outermost subroutine, it will share the variable
        as you would expect. But if the anonymous subroutine is called or
        referenced when the outermost subroutine is not active, it will see the
        value of the shared variable as it was before and during the *first*
        call to the outermost subroutine, which is probably not what you
      want.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In these circumstances, it is usually best to make the middle
        subroutine anonymous, using the <span class="Li">&quot;sub
        {}&quot;</span> syntax. Perl has specific support for shared variables
        in nested anonymous subroutines; a named subroutine in between
        interferes with this feature.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="Variable~2"><a class="permalink" href="#Variable~2">Variable
    &quot;%s&quot; will not stay shared</a></dt>
  <dd>(W) An inner (nested) <i>named</i> subroutine is referencing a lexical
      variable defined in an outer subroutine.
    <p class="Pp">When the inner subroutine is called, it will probably see the
        value of the outer subroutine's variable as it was before and during the
        *first* call to the outer subroutine; in this case, after the first call
        to the outer subroutine is complete, the inner and outer subroutines
        will no longer share a common value for the variable. In other words,
        the variable will no longer be shared.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Furthermore, if the outer subroutine is anonymous and
        references a lexical variable outside itself, then the outer and inner
        subroutines will <i>never</i> share the given variable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This problem can usually be solved by making the inner
        subroutine anonymous, using the <span class="Li">&quot;sub
        {}&quot;</span> syntax. When inner anonymous subs that reference
        variables in outer subroutines are called or referenced, they are
        automatically rebound to the current values of such variables.</p>

  <dt id="Ill-formed"><a class="permalink" href="#Ill-formed">Ill-formed logical

  <dd>(W) A warning peculiar to VMS. A logical name was encountered when

      syntactic rules governing logical names. Since it cannot be translated
      normally, it is skipped, and will not appear in
      <span class="Li">%ENV</span>. This may be a benign occurrence, as some
