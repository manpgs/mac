<p class="Pp">Pod is a simple-to-use markup language used for writing
    documentation for Perl, Perl programs, and Perl modules.</p>
<p class="Pp">Translators are available for converting Pod to various formats
    like plain text, HTML, man pages, and more.</p>
<p class="Pp">Pod markup consists of three basic kinds of paragraphs: ordinary,
    verbatim, and command.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Ordinary_Paragraph"><a class="permalink" href="#Ordinary_Paragraph">Ordinary
  Paragraph</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Most paragraphs in your documentation will be ordinary blocks of
    text, like this one. You can simply type in your text without any markup
    whatsoever, and with just a blank line before and after. When it gets
    formatted, it will undergo minimal formatting, like being rewrapped,
    probably put into a proportionally spaced font, and maybe even
  justified.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can use formatting codes in ordinary paragraphs, for
    <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, <span class="Li">&quot;code-style&quot;</span>,
    hyperlinks, and more. Such codes are explained in the &quot;Formatting
    Codes&quot; section, below.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Verbatim_Paragraph"><a class="permalink" href="#Verbatim_Paragraph">Verbatim
  Paragraph</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Verbatim paragraphs are usually used for presenting a codeblock or
    other text which does not require any special parsing or formatting, and
    which shouldn't be wrapped.</p>
<p class="Pp">A verbatim paragraph is distinguished by having its first
    character be a space or a tab. (And commonly, all its lines begin with
    spaces and/or tabs.) It should be reproduced exactly, with tabs assumed to
    be on 8-column boundaries. There are no special formatting codes, so you
    can't italicize or anything like that. A \ means \, and nothing else.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Command_Paragraph"><a class="permalink" href="#Command_Paragraph">Command
  Paragraph</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A command paragraph is used for special treatment of whole chunks
    of text, usually as headings or parts of lists.</p>
<p class="Pp">All command paragraphs (which are typically only one line long)
    start with &quot;=&quot;, followed by an identifier, followed by arbitrary
    text that the command can use however it pleases. Currently recognized
    commands are</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    =pod
    =head1 Heading Text
    =head2 Heading Text
    =head3 Heading Text
    =head4 Heading Text
    =over indentlevel
    =item stuff
    =back
    =begin format
    =end format
    =for format text...
    =encoding type
    =cut
</pre>
<p class="Pp">To explain them each in detail:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;=head1 <i>Heading Text</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;=head2 <i>Heading Text</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;=head3 <i>Heading Text</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;=head4 <i>Heading Text</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span></dt>
  <dd>Head1 through head4 produce headings, head1 being the highest level. The
      text in the rest of this paragraph is the content of the heading. For
      example:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  =head2 Object Attributes
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The text &quot;Object Attributes&quot; comprises the heading
        there. The text in these heading commands can use formatting codes, as
        seen here:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  =head2 Possible Values for C&lt;$/&gt;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Such commands are explained in the &quot;Formatting
        Codes&quot; section, below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;=over <i>indentlevel</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;=item <i>stuff...</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;=back&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Item, over, and back require a little more explanation: &quot;=over&quot;
      starts a region specifically for the generation of a list using
      &quot;=item&quot; commands, or for indenting (groups of) normal
      paragraphs. At the end of your list, use &quot;=back&quot; to end it. The
      <i>indentlevel</i> option to &quot;=over&quot; indicates how far over to
      indent, generally in ems (where one em is the width of an &quot;M&quot; in
      the document's base font) or roughly comparable units; if there is no
      <i>indentlevel</i> option, it defaults to four. (And some formatters may
      just ignore whatever <i>indentlevel</i> you provide.) In the <i>stuff</i>
      in <span class="Li">&quot;=item
      </span><i>stuff...</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>, you may use
      formatting codes, as seen here:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  =item Using C&lt;$|&gt; to Control Buffering
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Such commands are explained in the &quot;Formatting
        Codes&quot; section, below.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note also that there are some basic rules to using
        &quot;=over&quot; ... &quot;=back&quot; regions:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Don't use &quot;=item&quot;s outside of an &quot;=over&quot; ...
      &quot;=back&quot; region.</li>
  <li>The first thing after the &quot;=over&quot; command should be an
      &quot;=item&quot;, unless there aren't going to be any items at all in
      this &quot;=over&quot; ... &quot;=back&quot; region.</li>
  <li>Don't put &quot;=head<i>n</i>&quot; commands inside an &quot;=over&quot;
      ... &quot;=back&quot; region.</li>
  <li>And perhaps most importantly, keep the items consistent: either use
      &quot;=item *&quot; for all of them, to produce bullets; or use
      &quot;=item 1.&quot;, &quot;=item 2.&quot;, etc., to produce numbered
      lists; or use &quot;=item foo&quot;, &quot;=item bar&quot;, etc.--namely,
      things that look nothing like bullets or numbers.
    <p class="Pp">If you start with bullets or numbers, stick with them, as
        formatters use the first &quot;=item&quot; type to decide how to format
        the list.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;=cut&quot;</dt>
  <dd>To end a Pod block, use a blank line, then a line beginning with
      &quot;=cut&quot;, and a blank line after it. This lets Perl (and the Pod
      formatter) know that this is where Perl code is resuming. (The blank line
      before the &quot;=cut&quot; is not technically necessary, but many older
      Pod processors require it.)</dd>
  <dt>&quot;=pod&quot;</dt>
  <dd>The &quot;=pod&quot; command by itself doesn't do much of anything, but it
      signals to Perl (and Pod formatters) that a Pod block starts here. A Pod
      block starts with <i>any</i> command paragraph, so a &quot;=pod&quot;
      command is usually used just when you want to start a Pod block with an
      ordinary paragraph or a verbatim paragraph. For example:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  =item stuff()

  This function does stuff.

  =cut

  sub stuff {
    ...
  }

  =pod

  Remember to check its return value, as in:

    stuff() || die &quot;Couldn't do stuff!&quot;;

  =cut
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;=begin <i>formatname</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;=end <i>formatname</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>&quot;=for <i>formatname</i><span class="Li">
    </span><i>text...</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span></dt>
  <dd>For, begin, and end will let you have regions of text/code/data that are
      not generally interpreted as normal Pod text, but are passed directly to
      particular formatters, or are otherwise special. A formatter that can use
      that format will use the region, otherwise it will be completely ignored.
    <p class="Pp">A command &quot;=begin <i>formatname</i>&quot;, some
        paragraphs, and a command &quot;=end <i>formatname</i>&quot;, mean that
        the text/data in between is meant for formatters that understand the
        special format called <i>formatname</i>. For example,</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  =begin html

  &lt;hr&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;thang.png&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; This is a raw HTML paragraph &lt;/p&gt;

  =end html
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The command &quot;=for <i>formatname</i> <i>text...</i>&quot;
        specifies that the remainder of just this paragraph (starting right
        after <i>formatname</i>) is in that special format.</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  =for html &lt;hr&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;thang.png&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; This is a raw HTML paragraph &lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This means the same thing as the above &quot;=begin html&quot;
        ... &quot;=end html&quot; region.</p>
    <p class="Pp">That is, with &quot;=for&quot;, you can have only one
        paragraph's worth of text (i.e., the text in &quot;=foo targetname
        text...&quot;), but with &quot;=begin targetname&quot; ... &quot;=end
        targetname&quot;, you can have any amount of stuff in between. (Note
        that there still must be a blank line after the &quot;=begin&quot;
        command and a blank line before the &quot;=end&quot; command.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Here are some examples of how to use these:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  =begin html

  &lt;br&gt;Figure 1.&lt;br&gt;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;figure1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;

  =end html

  =begin text

    ---------------
    |  foo        |
    |        bar  |
    ---------------

  ^^^^ Figure 1. ^^^^

  =end text
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Some format names that formatters currently are known to
        accept include &quot;roff&quot;, &quot;man&quot;, &quot;latex&quot;,
        &quot;tex&quot;, &quot;text&quot;, and &quot;html&quot;. (Some
        formatters will treat some of these as synonyms.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">A format name of &quot;comment&quot; is common for just making
        notes (presumably to yourself) that won't appear in any formatted
        version of the Pod document:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  =for comment
  Make sure that all the available options are documented!
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Some <i>formatnames</i> will require a leading colon (as in
        <span class="Li">&quot;=for :formatname&quot;</span>, or
        <span class="Li">&quot;=begin :formatname&quot; ... &quot;=end
        :formatname&quot;</span>), to signal that the text is not raw data, but
        instead <i>is</i> Pod text (i.e., possibly containing formatting codes)
        that's just not for normal formatting (e.g., may not be a normal-use
        paragraph, but might be for formatting as a footnote).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>&quot;=encoding <i>encodingname</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span></dt>
  <dd>This command is used for declaring the encoding of a document. Most users
      won't need this; but if your encoding isn't US-ASCII or Latin-1, then put
      a <span class="Li">&quot;=encoding
      </span><i>encodingname</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span> command early in
      the document so that pod formatters will know how to decode the document.
      For <i>encodingname</i>, use a name recognized by the Encode::Supported
      module. Examples:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
  =encoding utf8

  =encoding koi8-r

  =encoding ShiftJIS

  =encoding big5
    </pre>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;=encoding&quot;</span> affects the whole
    document, and must occur only once.</p>
<p class="Pp">And don't forget, when using any other command, that the command
    lasts up until the end of its <i>paragraph</i>, not its line. So in the
    examples below, you can see that every command needs the blank line after
    it, to end its paragraph.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some examples of lists include:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  =over

  =item *

  First item

  =item *

  Second item

  =back

  =over

  =item Foo()

  Description of Foo function

  =item Bar()

  Description of Bar function

  =back

  Codes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In ordinary paragraphs and in some command paragraphs, various

      &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;NE&lt;lt&gt;3&quot;</span>&quot; (for
      &quot;N&lt;3&quot;) you could write
      &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;NZ&lt;&gt;&lt;3&quot;</span>&quot; (the
      &quot;Z&lt;&gt;&quot; breaks up the &quot;N&quot; and the &quot;&lt;&quot;
      so they can't be considered the part of a (fictitious)
      &quot;N&lt;...&gt;&quot; code).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Most of the time, you will need only a single set of angle
    brackets to delimit the beginning and end of formatting codes. However,
    sometimes you will want to put a real right angle bracket (a greater-than
    sign, '&gt;') inside of a formatting code. This is particularly common when
    using a formatting code to provide a different font-type for a snippet of
    code. As with all things in Perl, there is more than one way to do it. One
    way is to simply escape the closing bracket using an
    <span class="Li">&quot;E&quot;</span> code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    C&lt;$a E&lt;lt&gt;=E&lt;gt&gt; $b&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This will produce: &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;$a &lt;=&gt;
    $b&quot;</span>&quot;</p>
<p class="Pp">A more readable, and perhaps more &quot;plain&quot; way is to use
    an alternate set of delimiters that doesn't require a single
    &quot;&gt;&quot; to be escaped. Doubled angle brackets (&quot;&lt;&lt;&quot;
    and &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;) may be used <i>if and only if there is</i>
    <i>whitespace right after the opening delimiter and whitespace right</i>
    <i>before the closing delimiter!</i> For example, the following will do the
    trick:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    C&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In fact, you can use as many repeated angle-brackets as you like
    so long as you have the same number of them in the opening and closing
    delimiters, and make sure that whitespace immediately follows the last
    '&lt;' of the opening delimiter, and immediately precedes the first '&gt;'
    of the closing delimiter. (The whitespace is ignored.) So the following will
    also work:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    C&lt;&lt;&lt; $a &lt;=&gt; $b &gt;&gt;&gt;
    C&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  $a &lt;=&gt; $b     &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">And they all mean exactly the same as this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    C&lt;$a E&lt;lt&gt;=E&lt;gt&gt; $b&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The multiple-bracket form does not affect the interpretation of
    the contents of the formatting code, only how it must end. That means that
    the examples above are also exactly the same as this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    C&lt;&lt; $a E&lt;lt&gt;=E&lt;gt&gt; $b &gt;&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">As a further example, this means that if you wanted to put these
    bits of code in <span class="Li">&quot;C&quot;</span> (code) style:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    open(X, &quot;&gt;&gt;thing.dat&quot;) || die $!
    $foo-&gt;bar();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">you could do it like so:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    C&lt;&lt;&lt; open(X, &quot;&gt;&gt;thing.dat&quot;) || die $! &gt;&gt;&gt;
    C&lt;&lt; $foo-&gt;bar(); &gt;&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">which is presumably easier to read than the old way:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    C&lt;open(X, &quot;E&lt;gt&gt;E&lt;gt&gt;thing.dat&quot;) || die $!&gt;
    C&lt;$foo-E&lt;gt&gt;bar();&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is currently supported by pod2text (Pod::Text), pod2man
    (Pod::Man), and any other pod2xxx or Pod::Xxxx translators that use
    Pod::Parser 1.093 or later, or Pod::Tree 1.02 or later.</p>

  Intent</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The intent is simplicity of use, not power of expression.
    Paragraphs look like paragraphs (block format), so that they stand out
    visually, and so that I could run them through
    <span class="Li">&quot;fmt&quot;</span> easily to reformat them (that's F7
    in my version of <b>vi</b>, or Esc Q in my version of <b>emacs</b>). I
    wanted the translator to always leave the
    <span class="Li">&quot;'&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;`&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span> quotes alone, in verbatim mode,
    so I could slurp in a working program, shift it over four spaces, and have
    it print out, er, verbatim. And presumably in a monospace font.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Pod format is not necessarily sufficient for writing a book.
    Pod is just meant to be an idiot-proof common source for nroff, HTML, TeX,
    and other markup languages, as used for online documentation. Translators
    exist for <b>pod2text</b>, <b>pod2html</b>, <b>pod2man</b> (that's for
    <i>nroff</i>(1) and <i>troff</i>(1)), <b>pod2latex</b>, and <b>pod2fm</b>.
    Various others are available in CPAN.</p>

  Pods in Perl Modules</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You can embed Pod documentation in your Perl modules and scripts.
    Start your documentation with an empty line, a &quot;=head1&quot; command at
    the beginning, and end it with a &quot;=cut&quot; command and an empty line.
    Perl will ignore the Pod text. See any of the supplied library modules for
    examples. If you're going to put your Pod at the end of the file, and you're
    using an __END__ or __DATA__ cut mark, make sure to put an empty line there
    before the first Pod command.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
  __END__

  =head1 NAME

  Time::Local - efficiently compute time from local and GMT time
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Without that empty line before the &quot;=head1&quot;, many
    translators wouldn't have recognized the &quot;=head1&quot; as starting a
    Pod block.</p>

  <li>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <p class="Pp">The <b>podchecker</b> command is provided for checking Pod
        syntax for errors and warnings. For example, it checks for completely
        blank lines in Pod blocks and for unknown commands and formatting codes.
        You should still also pass your document through one or more translators
        and proofread the result, or print out the result and proofread that.
        Some of the problems found may be bugs in the translators, which you may
        or may not wish to work around.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If you're more familiar with writing in HTML than with writing in Pod, you
      can try your hand at writing documentation in simple HTML, and converting
      it to Pod with the experimental Pod::HTML2Pod module, (available in CPAN),
      and looking at the resulting code. The experimental Pod::PXML module in
      CPAN might also be useful.</li>
  <li>Many older Pod translators require the lines before every Pod command and
      after every Pod command (including &quot;=cut&quot;!) to be a blank line.
      Having something like this:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
 # - - - - - - - - - - - -
 =item $firecracker-&gt;boom()

 This noisily detonates the firecracker object.
 =cut
 sub boom {
 ...
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">...will make such Pod translators completely fail to see the
        Pod block at all.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Instead, have it like this:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
 # - - - - - - - - - - - -

 =item $firecracker-&gt;boom()

 This noisily detonates the firecracker object.

 =cut

 sub boom {

    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>Some older Pod translators require paragraphs (including command
      paragraphs like &quot;=head2 Functions&quot;) to be separated by
      <i>completely</i> empty lines. If you have an apparently empty line with
      some spaces on it, this might not count as a separator for those
      translators, and that could cause odd formatting.</li>
  <li>Older translators might add wording around an L&lt;&gt; link, so that
      <span class="Li">&quot;L&lt;Foo::Bar&gt;&quot;</span> may become &quot;the
      Foo::Bar manpage&quot;, for example. So you shouldn't write things like
      <span class="Li">&quot;the L&lt;foo&gt;</span>
      <span class="Li">documentation&quot;</span>, if you want the translated
      document to read sensibly. Instead, write <span class="Li">&quot;the
      L&lt;Foo::Bar|Foo::Bar&gt; documentation&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;L&lt;the Foo::Bar
      documentation|Foo::Bar&gt;&quot;</span>, to control how the link comes
      out.</li>
  <li>Going past the 70th column in a verbatim block might be ungracefully
      wrapped by some formatters.</li>
