</section>

<p class="Pp"><b>uux</b> [ options ] command</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The <i>uux</i> command is used to execute a command on a remote
    system, or to execute a command on the local system using files from remote
    systems. The command is not executed immediately; the request is queued
    until the <i>uucico</i> (8) daemon calls the system and executes it. The
    daemon is started automatically unless one of the <b>-r</b> or
    <b>--nouucico</b> options is given.</p>
<p class="Pp">The actual command execution is done by the <i>uuxqt</i> (8)
    daemon.</p>
<p class="Pp">File arguments can be gathered from remote systems to the
    execution system, as can standard input. Standard output may be directed to
    a file on a remote system.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command name may be preceded by a system name followed by an
    exclamation point if it is to be executed on a remote system. An empty
    system name is taken as the local system.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each argument that contains an exclamation point is treated as
    naming a file. The system which the file is on is before the exclamation
    point, and the pathname on that system follows it. An empty system name is
    taken as the local system; this must be used to transfer a file to a command
    being executed on a remote system. If the path is not absolute, it will be
    appended to the current working directory on the local system; the result
    may not be meaningful on the remote system. A pathname may begin with ~/, in
    which case it is relative to the UUCP public directory (usually
    /usr/spool/uucppublic or /var/spool/uucppublic) on the appropriate system. A
    pathname may begin with ~name/, in which case it is relative to the home
    directory of the named user on the appropriate system.</p>
<p class="Pp">Standard input and output may be redirected as usual; the
    pathnames used may contain exclamation points to indicate that they are on
    remote systems. Note that the redirection characters must be quoted so that
    they are passed to <i>uux</i> rather than interpreted by the shell. Append
    redirection (&gt;&gt;) does not work.</p>
<p class="Pp">All specified files are gathered together into a single directory
    before execution of the command begins. This means that each file must have
    a distinct base name. For example,
  <br/>
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>uux 'sys1!diff sys2!~user1/foo sys3!~user2/foo &gt;!foo.diff'</pre>
will fail because both files will be copied to sys1 and stored under the name
  foo.
<p class="Pp">Arguments may be quoted by parentheses to avoid interpretation of
    exclamation points. This is useful when executing the <i>uucp</i> command on
    a remote system.</p>
<p class="Pp">A request to execute an empty command (e.g., <i>uux sys!)</i> will
    create a poll file for the specified system.</p>
<p class="Pp">The exit status of <i>uux</i> is one of the codes found in the
    header file <b>sysexits.h.</b> In particular, <b>EX_OK</b> ( <b>0</b> )
    indicates success, and <b>EX_TEMPFAIL</b> ( <b>75</b> ) indicates a
    temporary failure.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The following options may be given to <i>uux.</i></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-, -p, --stdin</b></dt>
  <dd>Read standard input and use it as the standard input for the command to be
      executed.</dd>
  <dt id="c,"><a class="permalink" href="#c,"><b>-c, --nocopy</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not copy local files to the spool directory. This is the default. If
      they are removed before being processed by the <i>uucico</i> (8) daemon,
      the copy will fail. The files must be readable by the <i>uucico</i> (8)
      daemon, as well as the by the invoker of <i>uux.</i></dd>
  <dt id="C,"><a class="permalink" href="#C,"><b>-C, --copy</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Copy local files to the spool directory.</dd>
  <dt id="l,"><a class="permalink" href="#l,"><b>-l, --link</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Link local files into the spool directory. If a file can not be linked
      because it is on a different device, it will be copied unless one of the
      <b>-c</b> or <b>--nocopy</b> options also appears (in other words, use of
      <b>--link</b> switches the default from <b>--nocopy</b> to <b>--copy).</b>
      If the files are changed before being processed by the <i>uucico</i> (8)
      daemon, the changed versions will be used. The files must be readable by
      the <i>uucico</i> (8) daemon, as well as by the invoker of
    <i>uux.</i></dd>
  <dt id="g"><a class="permalink" href="#g"><b>-g grade, --grade
    grade</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Set the grade of the file transfer command. Jobs of a higher grade are
      executed first. Grades run 0 ... 9 A ... Z a ... z from high to low.</dd>
  <dt id="n,"><a class="permalink" href="#n,"><b>-n,
    --notification=no</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not send mail about the status of the job, even if it fails.</dd>
  <dt id="z,"><a class="permalink" href="#z,"><b>-z,
    --notification=error</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Send mail about the status of the job if an error occurs. For many
      <i>uuxqt</i> daemons, including the Taylor UUCP <i>uuxqt,</i> this is the
      default action; for those, <b>--notification=error</b> will have no
      effect. However, some <i>uuxqt</i> daemons will send mail if the job
      succeeds unless the <b>--notification=error</b> option is used, and some
      other <i>uuxqt</i> daemons will not send mail if the job fails unless the
      <b>--notification=error</b> option is used.</dd>
  <dt id="r,"><a class="permalink" href="#r,"><b>-r, --nouucico</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Do not start the <i>uucico</i> (8) daemon immediately; merely queue up the
      execution request for later processing.</dd>
  <dt id="j,"><a class="permalink" href="#j,"><b>-j, --jobid</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print jobids on standard output. A jobid will be generated for each file
      copy operation required to perform the operation. These file copies may be
      cancelled by passing the jobid to the <b>--kill</b> switch of
      <i>uustat</i> (1), which will make the execution impossible to
    complete.</dd>
  <dt id="a"><a class="permalink" href="#a"><b>-a address, --requestor
    address</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Report job status to the specified e-mail address.</dd>
  <dt id="x"><a class="permalink" href="#x"><b>-x type, --debug
    type</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Turn on particular debugging types. The following types are recognized:
      abnormal, chat, handshake, uucp-proto, proto, port, config, spooldir,
      execute, incoming, outgoing. Only abnormal, config, spooldir and execute
      are meaningful for <i>uux.</i>
    <p class="Pp">Multiple types may be given, separated by commas, and the
        <b>--debug</b> option may appear multiple times. A number may also be
        given, which will turn on that many types from the foregoing list; for
        example, <b>--debug 2</b> is equivalent to <b>--debug
      abnormal,chat.</b></p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="I"><a class="permalink" href="#I"><b>-I file, --config
    file</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Set configuration file to use. This option may not be available, depending
      upon how <i>uux</i> was compiled.</dd>
  <dt id="v,"><a class="permalink" href="#v,"><b>-v, --version</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Report version information and exit.</dd>
  <dt id="help"><a class="permalink" href="#help"><b>--help</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Print a help message and exit.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLES"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a></h1>
<pre>uux -z - sys1!rmail user1</pre>
<p class="Pp">Execute the command ``rmail user1'' on the system sys1, giving it
    as standard input whatever is given to <i>uux</i> as standard input. If a
    failure occurs, send a message using <i>mail</i> (1).</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>uux 'diff -c sys1!~user1/file1 sys2!~user2/file2 &gt;!file.diff'</pre>
Fetch the two named files from system sys1 and system sys2 and execute
  <i>diff</i> putting the result in file.diff in the current directory. The
  current directory must be writable by the <i>uuxqt</i> (8) daemon for this to
  work.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>uux 'sys1!uucp ~user1/file1 (sys2!~user2/file2)'</pre>
Execute <i>uucp</i> on the system sys1 copying file1 (on system sys1) to sys2.
  This illustrates the use of parentheses for quoting.

<h1 class="Sh" id="RESTRICTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#RESTRICTIONS">RESTRICTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The remote system may not permit you to execute certain commands.
    Many remote systems only permit the execution of <i>rmail</i> and
    <i>rnews.</i></p>
<p class="Pp">Some of the options are dependent on the capabilities of the
    <i>uuxqt</i> (8) daemon on the remote system.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Files can not be referenced across multiple systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">Too many jobids are output by <b>--jobid,</b> and there is no good
    way to cancel a local execution requiring remote files.</p>
