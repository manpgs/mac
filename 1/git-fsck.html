<p class="Pp">&lt;object&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An object to treat as the head of an unreachability
  trace.
<p class="Pp">If no objects are given, <i>git fsck</i> defaults to using the
    index file, all SHA-1 references in <b>refs</b> namespace, and all reflogs
    (unless --no-reflogs is given) as heads.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--unreachable</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print out objects that exist but that aren&#x2019;t
  reachable from any of the reference nodes.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]dangling</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print objects that exist but that are never
  <i>directly</i> used (default). <b>--no-dangling</b> can be used to omit this
  information from the output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--root</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Report root nodes.</div>
<p class="Pp">--tags</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Report tags.</div>
<p class="Pp">--cache</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Consider any object recorded in the index also as a head
  node for an unreachability trace.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-reflogs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not consider commits that are referenced only by an
  entry in a reflog to be reachable. This option is meant only to search for
  commits that used to be in a ref, but now aren&#x2019;t, but are still in that
  corresponding reflog.</div>
<p class="Pp">--full</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Check not just objects in GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY
  ($GIT_DIR/objects), but also the ones found in alternate object pools listed
  in GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES or $GIT_DIR/objects/info/alternates, and
  in packed Git archives found in $GIT_DIR/objects/pack and corresponding pack
  subdirectories in alternate object pools. This is now default; you can turn it
  off with --no-full.</div>
<p class="Pp">--connectivity-only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Check only the connectivity of reachable objects, making
  sure that any objects referenced by a reachable tag, commit, or tree is
  present. This speeds up the operation by avoiding reading blobs entirely
  (though it does still check that referenced blobs exist). This will detect
  corruption in commits and trees, but not do any semantic checks (e.g., for
  format errors). Corruption in blob objects will not be detected at all.
<p class="Pp">Unreachable tags, commits, and trees will also be accessed to find
    the tips of dangling segments of history. Use <b>--no-dangling</b> if you
    don&#x2019;t care about this output and want to speed it up further.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--strict</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable more strict checking, namely to catch a file mode
  recorded with g+w bit set, which was created by older versions of Git.
  Existing repositories, including the Linux kernel, Git itself, and sparse
  repository have old objects that triggers this check, but it is recommended to
  check new projects with this flag.</div>
<p class="Pp">--verbose</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Be chatty.</div>
<p class="Pp">--lost-found</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Write dangling objects into .git/lost-found/commit/ or
  .git/lost-found/other/, depending on type. If the object is a blob, the
  contents are written into the file, rather than its object name.</div>
<p class="Pp">--name-objects</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When displaying names of reachable objects, in addition
  to the SHA-1 also display a name that describes <b>how</b> they are reachable,
  compatible with <b>git-rev-parse</b>(1), e.g.
  <b>HEAD@{1234567890}~25^2:src/</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]progress</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Progress status is reported on the standard error stream
  by default when it is attached to a terminal, unless --no-progress or
  --verbose is specified. --progress forces progress status even if the standard
  error stream is not directed to a terminal.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">During fsck git may find issues with legacy data which
  wouldn&#x2019;t be generated by current versions of git, and which
  wouldn&#x2019;t be sent over the wire if <b>transfer.fsckObjects</b> was set.
  This feature is intended to support working with legacy repositories
  containing such data.
<p class="Pp">Setting <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> will be picked up by
    <b>git-fsck</b>(1), but to accept pushes of such data set
    <b>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> instead, or to clone or fetch it set
    <b>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The rest of the documentation discusses <b>fsck.*</b> for brevity,
    but the same applies for the corresponding <b>receive.fsck.*</b> and
    <b>fetch.&lt;msg-id&gt;.*</b>. variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike variables like <b>color.ui</b> and <b>core.editor</b> the
    <b>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> and <b>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b>
    variables will not fall back on the <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> configuration
    if they aren&#x2019;t set. To uniformly configure the same fsck settings in
    different circumstances all three of them they must all set to the same
    values.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> is set, errors can be switched to
    warnings and vice versa by configuring the <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b>
    setting where the <b>&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> is the fsck message ID and the value
    is one of <b>error</b>, <b>warn</b> or <b>ignore</b>. For convenience, fsck
    prefixes the error/warning with the message ID, e.g. &quot;missingEmail:
    invalid author/committer line - missing email&quot; means that setting
    <b>fsck.missingEmail = ignore</b> will hide that issue.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, it is better to enumerate existing objects with
    problems with <b>fsck.skipList</b>, instead of listing the kind of breakages
    these problematic objects share to be ignored, as doing the latter will
    allow new instances of the same breakages go unnoticed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Setting an unknown <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> value will cause
    fsck to die, but doing the same for <b>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> and
    <b>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> will only cause git to warn.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">fsck.skipList</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The path to a list of object names (i.e. one
  unabbreviated SHA-1 per line) that are known to be broken in a non-fatal way
  and should be ignored. On versions of Git 2.20 and later comments (<i>#</i>),
  empty lines, and any leading and trailing whitespace is ignored. Everything
  but a SHA-1 per line will error out on older versions.
<p class="Pp">This feature is useful when an established project should be
    accepted despite early commits containing errors that can be safely ignored
    such as invalid committer email addresses. Note: corrupt objects cannot be
    skipped with this setting.</p>
<p class="Pp">Like <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> this variable has corresponding
    <b>receive.fsck.skipList</b> and <b>fetch.fsck.skipList</b> variants.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike variables like <b>color.ui</b> and <b>core.editor</b> the
    <b>receive.fsck.skipList</b> and <b>fetch.fsck.skipList</b> variables will
    not fall back on the <b>fsck.skipList</b> configuration if they
    aren&#x2019;t set. To uniformly configure the same fsck settings in
    different circumstances all three of them they must all set to the same
    values.</p>
<p class="Pp">Older versions of Git (before 2.20) documented that the object
    names list should be sorted. This was never a requirement, the object names
    could appear in any order, but when reading the list we tracked whether the
    list was sorted for the purposes of an internal binary search
    implementation, which could save itself some work with an already sorted
    list. Unless you had a humongous list there was no reason to go out of your
    way to pre-sort the list. After Git version 2.20 a hash implementation is
    used instead, so there&#x2019;s now no reason to pre-sort the list.</p>

<p class="Pp">git-fsck tests SHA-1 and general object sanity, and it does full
    tracking of the resulting reachability and everything else. It prints out
    any corruption it finds (missing or bad objects), and if you use the
    <b>--unreachable</b> flag it will also print out objects that exist but that
    aren&#x2019;t reachable from any of the specified head nodes (or the default
    set, as mentioned above).</p>
<p class="Pp">Any corrupt objects you will have to find in backups or other
    archives (i.e., you can just remove them and do an <i>rsync</i> with some
    other site in the hopes that somebody else has the object you have
    corrupted).</p>
<p class="Pp">If core.commitGraph is true, the commit-graph file will also be
    inspected using <i>git commit-graph verify</i>. See
    <b>git-commit-graph</b>(1).</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">The &lt;type&gt; object &lt;object&gt;, isn&#x2019;t

  seen. This can mean that there&#x2019;s another root node that you&#x2019;re
  not specifying or that the tree is corrupt. If you haven&#x2019;t missed a
  root node then you might as well delete unreachable nodes since they
  can&#x2019;t be used.</div>
