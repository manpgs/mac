<p class="Pp">You can query/set/replace/unset options with this command. The
    name is actually the section and the key separated by a dot, and the value
    will be escaped.</p>
<p class="Pp">Multiple lines can be added to an option by using the <b>--add</b>
    option. If you want to update or unset an option which can occur on multiple
    lines, a <b>value-pattern</b> (which is an extended regular expression,
    unless the <b>--fixed-value</b> option is given) needs to be given. Only the
    existing values that match the pattern are updated or unset. If you want to
    handle the lines that do <b>not</b> match the pattern, just prepend a single
    exclamation mark in front (see also the section called
    &#x201C;EXAMPLES&#x201D;), but note that this only works when the
    <b>--fixed-value</b> option is not in use.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>--type=&lt;type&gt;</b> option instructs <i>git config</i>
    to ensure that incoming and outgoing values are canonicalize-able under the
    given &lt;type&gt;. If no <b>--type=&lt;type&gt;</b> is given, no
    canonicalization will be performed. Callers may unset an existing
    <b>--type</b> specifier with <b>--no-type</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When reading, the values are read from the system, global and
    repository local configuration files by default, and options
    <b>--system</b>, <b>--global</b>, <b>--local</b>, <b>--worktree</b> and
    <b>--file &lt;filename&gt;</b> can be used to tell the command to read from
    only that location (see the section called &#x201C;FILES&#x201D;).</p>
<p class="Pp">When writing, the new value is written to the repository local
    configuration file by default, and options <b>--system</b>, <b>--global</b>,
    <b>--worktree</b>, <b>--file &lt;filename&gt;</b> can be used to tell the
    command to write to that location (you can say <b>--local</b> but that is
    the default).</p>
<p class="Pp">This command will fail with non-zero status upon error. Some exit
    codes are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The section or key is invalid (ret=1),</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;no section or name was provided (ret=2),</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the config file is invalid (ret=3),</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;the config file cannot be written (ret=4),</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;you try to unset an option which does not exist
  (ret=5),</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;you try to unset/set an option for which multiple
  lines match (ret=5), or</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;you try to use an invalid regexp (ret=6).</div>
<p class="Pp">On success, the command returns the exit code 0.</p>
<p class="Pp">A list of all available configuration variables can be obtained
    using the <b>git help --config</b> command.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">--replace-all</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Default behavior is to replace at most one line. This
  replaces all lines matching the key (and optionally the
  <b>value-pattern</b>).</div>
<p class="Pp">--add</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Adds a new line to the option without altering any
  existing values. This is the same as providing <i>^$</i> as the
  <b>value-pattern</b> in <b>--replace-all</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--get</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Get the value for a given key (optionally filtered by a
  regex matching the value). Returns error code 1 if the key was not found and
  the last value if multiple key values were found.</div>
<p class="Pp">--get-all</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Like get, but returns all values for a multi-valued
  key.</div>
<p class="Pp">--get-regexp</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Like --get-all, but interprets the name as a regular
  expression and writes out the key names. Regular expression matching is
  currently case-sensitive and done against a canonicalized version of the key
  in which section and variable names are lowercased, but subsection names are
  not.</div>
<p class="Pp">--get-urlmatch &lt;name&gt; &lt;URL&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When given a two-part name section.key, the value for
  section.&lt;URL&gt;.key whose &lt;URL&gt; part matches the best to the given
  URL is returned (if no such key exists, the value for section.key is used as a
  fallback). When given just the section as name, do so for all the keys in the
  section and list them. Returns error code 1 if no value is found.</div>
<p class="Pp">--global</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For writing options: write to global <b>~/.gitconfig</b>
  file rather than the repository <b>.git/config</b>, write to
  <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config</b> file if this file exists and the
  <b>~/.gitconfig</b> file doesn&#x2019;t.
<p class="Pp">For reading options: read only from global <b>~/.gitconfig</b> and
    from <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config</b> rather than from all available
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also the section called &#x201C;FILES&#x201D;.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--system</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For writing options: write to system-wide
  <b>$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig</b> rather than the repository <b>.git/config</b>.
<p class="Pp">For reading options: read only from system-wide
    <b>$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig</b> rather than from all available files.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also the section called &#x201C;FILES&#x201D;.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--local</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For writing options: write to the repository
  <b>.git/config</b> file. This is the default behavior.
<p class="Pp">For reading options: read only from the repository
    <b>.git/config</b> rather than from all available files.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also the section called &#x201C;FILES&#x201D;.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--worktree</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Similar to <b>--local</b> except that
  <b>$GIT_DIR/config.worktree</b> is read from or written to if
  <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b> is enabled. If not it&#x2019;s the same as
  <b>--local</b>. Note that <b>$GIT_DIR</b> is equal to <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b>
  for the main working tree, but is of the form
  <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/</b> for other working trees. See
  <b>git-worktree</b>(1) to learn how to enable
  <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-f &lt;config-file&gt;, --file &lt;config-file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For writing options: write to the specified file rather
  than the repository <b>.git/config</b>.
<p class="Pp">For reading options: read only from the specified file rather than
    from all available files.</p>
<p class="Pp">See also the section called &#x201C;FILES&#x201D;.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--blob &lt;blob&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Similar to <b>--file</b> but use the given blob instead
  of a file. E.g. you can use <i>master:.gitmodules</i> to read values from the
  file <i>.gitmodules</i> in the master branch. See &quot;SPECIFYING
  REVISIONS&quot; section in <b>gitrevisions</b>(7) for a more complete list of
  ways to spell blob names.</div>
<p class="Pp">--remove-section</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Remove the given section from the configuration
  file.</div>
<p class="Pp">--rename-section</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Rename the given section to a new name.</div>
<p class="Pp">--unset</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Remove the line matching the key from config file.</div>
<p class="Pp">--unset-all</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Remove all lines matching the key from config file.</div>
<p class="Pp">-l, --list</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">List all variables set in config file, along with their
  values.</div>
<p class="Pp">--fixed-value</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When used with the <b>value-pattern</b> argument, treat
  <b>value-pattern</b> as an exact string instead of a regular expression. This
  will restrict the name/value pairs that are matched to only those where the
  value is exactly equal to the <b>value-pattern</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--type &lt;type&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><i>git config</i> will ensure that any input or output is
  valid under the given type constraint(s), and will canonicalize outgoing
  values in <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>'s canonical form.
<p class="Pp">Valid <b>&lt;type&gt;</b>'s include:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>bool</i>: canonicalize values as either
  &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>int</i>: canonicalize values as simple decimal
  numbers. An optional suffix of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> will cause the
  value to be multiplied by 1024, 1048576, or 1073741824 upon input.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>bool-or-int</i>: canonicalize according to
  either <i>bool</i> or <i>int</i>, as described above.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>path</i>: canonicalize by adding a leading
  <b>~</b> to the value of <b>$HOME</b> and <b>~user</b> to the home directory
  for the specified user. This specifier has no effect when setting the value
  (but you can use <b>git config section.variable ~/</b> from the command line
  to let your shell do the expansion.)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>expiry-date</i>: canonicalize by converting
  from a fixed or relative date-string to a timestamp. This specifier has no
  effect when setting the value.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>color</i>: When getting a value, canonicalize
  by converting to an ANSI color escape sequence. When setting a value, a
  sanity-check is performed to ensure that the given value is canonicalize-able
  as an ANSI color, but it is written as-is.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--bool, --int, --bool-or-int, --path, --expiry-date</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Historical options for selecting a type specifier. Prefer
  instead <b>--type</b> (see above).</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-type</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Un-sets the previously set type specifier (if one was
  previously set). This option requests that <i>git config</i> not canonicalize
  the retrieved variable. <b>--no-type</b> has no effect without
  <b>--type=&lt;type&gt;</b> or <b>--&lt;type&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-z, --null</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For all options that output values and/or keys, always
  end values with the null character (instead of a newline). Use newline instead
  as a delimiter between key and value. This allows for secure parsing of the
  output without getting confused e.g. by values that contain line breaks.</div>
<p class="Pp">--name-only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output only the names of config variables for
  <b>--list</b> or <b>--get-regexp</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--show-origin</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Augment the output of all queried config options with the
  origin type (file, standard input, blob, command line) and the actual origin
  (config file path, ref, or blob id if applicable).</div>
<p class="Pp">--show-scope</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Similar to <b>--show-origin</b> in that it augments the
  output of all queried config options with the scope of that value (worktree,
  local, global, system, command).</div>
<p class="Pp">--get-colorbool &lt;name&gt; [&lt;stdout-is-tty&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Find the color setting for <b>&lt;name&gt;</b> (e.g.
  <b>color.diff</b>) and output &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;.
  <b>&lt;stdout-is-tty&gt;</b> should be either &quot;true&quot; or
  &quot;false&quot;, and is taken into account when configuration says
  &quot;auto&quot;. If <b>&lt;stdout-is-tty&gt;</b> is missing, then checks the
  standard output of the command itself, and exits with status 0 if color is to
  be used, or exits with status 1 otherwise. When the color setting for
  <b>name</b> is undefined, the command uses <b>color.ui</b> as fallback.</div>
<p class="Pp">--get-color &lt;name&gt; [&lt;default&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Find the color configured for <b>name</b> (e.g.
  <b>color.diff.new</b>) and output it as the ANSI color escape sequence to the
  standard output. The optional <b>default</b> parameter is used instead, if
  there is no color configured for <b>name</b>.
<p class="Pp"><b>--type=color [--default=&lt;default&gt;]</b> is preferred over
    <b>--get-color</b> (but note that <b>--get-color</b> will omit the trailing
    newline printed by <b>--type=color</b>).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-e, --edit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Opens an editor to modify the specified config file;
  either <b>--system</b>, <b>--global</b>, or repository (default).</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]includes</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Respect <b>include.*</b> directives in config files when
  looking up values. Defaults to <b>off</b> when a specific file is given (e.g.,
  using <b>--file</b>, <b>--global</b>, etc) and <b>on</b> when searching all
  config files.</div>
<p class="Pp">--default &lt;value&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When using <b>--get</b>, and the requested variable is
  not found, behave as if &lt;value&gt; were the value assigned to the that
  variable.</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION">CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp"><b>pager.config</b> is only respected when listing configuration,
    i.e., when using <b>--list</b> or any of the <b>--get-*</b> which may return
    multiple results. The default is to use a pager.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="permalink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If not set explicitly with <b>--file</b>, there are four files
    where <i>git config</i> will search for configuration options:</p>
<p class="Pp">$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">System-wide configuration file.</div>
<p class="Pp">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Second user-specific configuration file. If
  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set or empty, <b>$HOME/.config/git/config</b> will be
  used. Any single-valued variable set in this file will be overwritten by
  whatever is in <b>~/.gitconfig</b>. It is a good idea not to create this file
  if you sometimes use older versions of Git, as support for this file was added
  fairly recently.</div>
<p class="Pp">~/.gitconfig</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">User-specific configuration file. Also called
  &quot;global&quot; configuration file.</div>
<p class="Pp">$GIT_DIR/config</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Repository specific configuration file.</div>
<p class="Pp">$GIT_DIR/config.worktree</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is optional and is only searched when
  <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b> is present in $GIT_DIR/config.</div>
<p class="Pp">If no further options are given, all reading options will read all
    of these files that are available. If the global or the system-wide
    configuration file are not available they will be ignored. If the repository
    configuration file is not available or readable, <i>git config</i> will exit
    with a non-zero error code. However, in neither case will an error message
    be issued.</p>
<p class="Pp">The files are read in the order given above, with last value found
    taking precedence over values read earlier. When multiple values are taken
    then all values of a key from all files will be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may override individual configuration parameters when running
    any git command by using the <b>-c</b> option. See <b>git</b>(1) for
    details.</p>
<p class="Pp">All writing options will per default write to the repository
    specific configuration file. Note that this also affects options like
    <b>--replace-all</b> and <b>--unset</b>. <b></b><i>git config</i><b> will
    only ever change one file at a time</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can override these rules using the <b>--global</b>,
    <b>--system</b>, <b>--local</b>, <b>--worktree</b>, and <b>--file</b>
    command-line options; see the section called &#x201C;OPTIONS&#x201D;
  above.</p>

<p class="Pp">GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL, GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Take the configuration from the given files instead from
  global or system-level configuration. See <b>git</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether to skip reading settings from the system-wide

<p class="Pp">GIT_CONFIG_COUNT, GIT_CONFIG_KEY_&lt;n&gt;,
    GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If GIT_CONFIG_COUNT is set to a positive number, all
  environment pairs GIT_CONFIG_KEY_&lt;n&gt; and GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_&lt;n&gt; up
  to that number will be added to the process&#x2019;s runtime configuration.
  The config pairs are zero-indexed. Any missing key or value is treated as an
  error. An empty GIT_CONFIG_COUNT is treated the same as GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=0,
  namely no pairs are processed. These environment variables will override
  values in configuration files, but will be overridden by any explicit options
  passed via <b>git -c</b>.
<p class="Pp">This is useful for cases where you want to spawn multiple git
    commands with a common configuration but cannot depend on a configuration
    file, for example when writing scripts.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">GIT_CONFIG</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If no <b>--file</b> option is provided to <b>git
  config</b>, use the file given by <b>GIT_CONFIG</b> as if it were provided via
  <b>--file</b>. This variable has no effect on other Git commands, and is
  mostly for historical compatibility; there is generally no reason to use it
  instead of the <b>--file</b> option.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="CONFIGURATION_FILE"><a class="permalink" href="#CONFIGURATION_FILE">CONFIGURATION
  FILE</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The Git configuration file contains a number of variables that
    affect the Git commands' behavior. The files <b>.git/config</b> and
    optionally <b>config.worktree</b> (see the &quot;CONFIGURATION FILE&quot;
    section of <b>git-worktree</b>(1)) in each repository are used to store the
    configuration for that repository, and <b>$HOME/.gitconfig</b> is used to
    store a per-user configuration as fallback values for the <b>.git/config</b>
    file. The file <b>/etc/gitconfig</b> can be used to store a system-wide
    default configuration.</p>
<p class="Pp">The configuration variables are used by both the Git plumbing and
    the porcelains. The variables are divided into sections, wherein the fully
    qualified variable name of the variable itself is the last dot-separated
    segment and the section name is everything before the last dot. The variable
    names are case-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric characters and <b>-</b>,
    and must start with an alphabetic character. Some variables may appear
    multiple times; we say then that the variable is multivalued.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Syntax"><a class="permalink" href="#Syntax">Syntax</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The syntax is fairly flexible and permissive; whitespaces are
    mostly ignored. The <i>#</i> and <i>;</i> characters begin comments to the
    end of line, blank lines are ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">The file consists of sections and variables. A section begins with
    the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next
    section begins. Section names are case-insensitive. Only alphanumeric
    characters, <b>-</b> and <b>.</b> are allowed in section names. Each
    variable must belong to some section, which means that there must be a
    section header before the first setting of a variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sections can be further divided into subsections. To begin a
    subsection put its name in double quotes, separated by space from the
    section name, in the section header, like in the example below:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        [section &quot;subsection&quot;]
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<p class="Pp">Subsection names are case sensitive and can contain any characters
    except newline and the null byte. Doublequote <b>&quot;</b> and backslash
    can be included by escaping them as <b>\&quot;</b> and <b>\\</b>,
    respectively. Backslashes preceding other characters are dropped when
    reading; for example, <b>\t</b> is read as <b>t</b> and <b>\0</b> is read as
    <b>0</b>. Section headers cannot span multiple lines. Variables may belong
    directly to a section or to a given subsection. You can have
    <b>[section]</b> if you have <b>[section &quot;subsection&quot;]</b>, but
    you don&#x2019;t need to.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is also a deprecated <b>[section.subsection]</b> syntax.
    With this syntax, the subsection name is converted to lower-case and is also
    compared case sensitively. These subsection names follow the same
    restrictions as section names.</p>
<p class="Pp">All the other lines (and the remainder of the line after the
    section header) are recognized as setting variables, in the form <i>name =
    value</i> (or just <i>name</i>, which is a short-hand to say that the
    variable is the boolean &quot;true&quot;). The variable names are
    case-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric characters and <b>-</b>, and must
    start with an alphabetic character.</p>
<p class="Pp">A line that defines a value can be continued to the next line by
    ending it with a <b>\</b>; the backslash and the end-of-line are stripped.
    Leading whitespaces after <i>name =</i>, the remainder of the line after the
    first comment character <i>#</i> or <i>;</i>, and trailing whitespaces of
    the line are discarded unless they are enclosed in double quotes. Internal
    whitespaces within the value are retained verbatim.</p>
<p class="Pp">Inside double quotes, double quote <b>&quot;</b> and backslash
    <b>\</b> characters must be escaped: use <b>\&quot;</b> for <b>&quot;</b>
    and <b>\\</b> for <b>\</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following escape sequences (beside <b>\&quot;</b> and
    <b>\\</b>) are recognized: <b>\n</b> for newline character (NL), <b>\t</b>
    for horizontal tabulation (HT, TAB) and <b>\b</b> for backspace (BS). Other
    char escape sequences (including octal escape sequences) are invalid.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Includes"><a class="permalink" href="#Includes">Includes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <b>include</b> and <b>includeIf</b> sections allow you to
    include config directives from another source. These sections behave
    identically to each other with the exception that <b>includeIf</b> sections
    may be ignored if their condition does not evaluate to true; see
    &quot;Conditional includes&quot; below.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can include a config file from another by setting the special
    <b>include.path</b> (or <b>includeIf.*.path</b>) variable to the name of the
    file to be included. The variable takes a pathname as its value, and is
    subject to tilde expansion. These variables can be given multiple times.</p>
<p class="Pp">The contents of the included file are inserted immediately, as if
    they had been found at the location of the include directive. If the value
    of the variable is a relative path, the path is considered to be relative to
    the configuration file in which the include directive was found. See below
    for examples.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Conditional_includes"><a class="permalink" href="#Conditional_includes">Conditional
  includes</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">You can include a config file from another conditionally by
    setting a <b>includeIf.&lt;condition&gt;.path</b> variable to the name of
    the file to be included.</p>
<p class="Pp">The condition starts with a keyword followed by a colon and some
    data whose format and meaning depends on the keyword. Supported keywords
    are:</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>gitdir</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The data that follows the keyword <b>gitdir:</b> is used
  as a glob pattern. If the location of the .git directory matches the pattern,
  the include condition is met.
<p class="Pp">The .git location may be auto-discovered, or come from
    <b>$GIT_DIR</b> environment variable. If the repository is auto discovered
    via a .git file (e.g. from submodules, or a linked worktree), the .git
    location would be the final location where the .git directory is, not where
    the .git file is.</p>
<p class="Pp">The pattern can contain standard globbing wildcards and two
    additional ones, <b>**/</b> and <b>/**</b>, that can match multiple path
    components. Please refer to <b>gitignore</b>(5) for details. For
    convenience:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If the pattern starts with <b>~/</b>, <b>~</b>
  will be substituted with the content of the environment variable
  <b>HOME</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If the pattern starts with <b>./</b>, it is
  replaced with the directory containing the current config file.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If the pattern does not start with either
  <b>~/</b>, <b>./</b> or <b>/</b>, <b>**/</b> will be automatically prepended.
  For example, the pattern <b>foo/bar</b> becomes <b>**/foo/bar</b> and would
  match <b>/any/path/to/foo/bar</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If the pattern ends with <b>/</b>, <b>**</b> will
  be automatically added. For example, the pattern <b>foo/</b> becomes
  <b>foo/**</b>. In other words, it matches &quot;foo&quot; and everything
  inside, recursively.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>gitdir/i</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is the same as <b>gitdir</b> except that matching is
  done case-insensitively (e.g. on case-insensitive file systems)</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>onbranch</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The data that follows the keyword <b>onbranch:</b> is
  taken to be a pattern with standard globbing wildcards and two additional
  ones, <b>**/</b> and <b>/**</b>, that can match multiple path components. If
  we are in a worktree where the name of the branch that is currently checked
  out matches the pattern, the include condition is met.
<p class="Pp">If the pattern ends with <b>/</b>, <b>**</b> will be automatically
    added. For example, the pattern <b>foo/</b> becomes <b>foo/**</b>. In other
    words, it matches all branches that begin with <b>foo/</b>. This is useful
    if your branches are organized hierarchically and you would like to apply a
    configuration to all the branches in that hierarchy.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>hasconfig:remote.*.url:</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The data that follows this keyword is taken to be a
  pattern with standard globbing wildcards and two additional ones, <b>**/</b>
  and <b>/**</b>, that can match multiple components. The first time this
  keyword is seen, the rest of the config files will be scanned for remote URLs
  (without applying any values). If there exists at least one remote URL that
  matches this pattern, the include condition is met.
<p class="Pp">Files included by this option (directly or indirectly) are not
    allowed to contain remote URLs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that unlike other includeIf conditions, resolving this
    condition relies on information that is not yet known at the point of
    reading the condition. A typical use case is this option being present as a
    system-level or global-level config, and the remote URL being in a
    local-level config; hence the need to scan ahead when resolving this
    condition. In order to avoid the chicken-and-egg problem in which
    potentially-included files can affect whether such files are potentially
    included, Git breaks the cycle by prohibiting these files from affecting the
    resolution of these conditions (thus, prohibiting them from declaring remote
    URLs).</p>
<p class="Pp">As for the naming of this keyword, it is for forwards compatibiliy
    with a naming scheme that supports more variable-based include conditions,
    but currently Git only supports the exact keyword described above.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">A few more notes on matching via <b>gitdir</b> and
    <b>gitdir/i</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Symlinks in <b>$GIT_DIR</b> are not resolved
  before matching.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Both the symlink &amp; realpath versions of paths
  will be matched outside of <b>$GIT_DIR</b>. E.g. if ~/git is a symlink to
  /mnt/storage/git, both <b>gitdir:~/git</b> and <b>gitdir:/mnt/storage/git</b>
  will match.
<p class="Pp">This was not the case in the initial release of this feature in
    v2.13.0, which only matched the realpath version. Configuration that wants
    to be compatible with the initial release of this feature needs to either
    specify only the realpath version, or both versions.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Note that &quot;../&quot; is not special and will
  match literally, which is unlikely what you want.</div>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Values"><a class="permalink" href="#Values">Values</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Values of many variables are treated as a simple string, but there
    are variables that take values of specific types and there are rules as to
    how to spell them.</p>
<p class="Pp">boolean</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When a variable is said to take a boolean value, many
  synonyms are accepted for <i>true</i> and <i>false</i>; these are all
  case-insensitive.
<p class="Pp">true</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Boolean true literals are <b>yes</b>, <b>on</b>,
  <b>true</b>, and <b>1</b>. Also, a variable defined without <b>=
  &lt;value&gt;</b> is taken as true.</div>
<p class="Pp">false</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Boolean false literals are <b>no</b>, <b>off</b>,
  <b>false</b>, <b>0</b> and the empty string.
<p class="Pp">When converting a value to its canonical form using the
    <b>--type=bool</b> type specifier, <i>git config</i> will ensure that the
    output is &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; (spelled in lowercase).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">integer</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The value for many variables that specify various sizes
  can be suffixed with <b>k</b>, <b>M</b>,... to mean &quot;scale the number by
  1024&quot;, &quot;by 1024x1024&quot;, etc.</div>
<p class="Pp">color</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The value for a variable that takes a color is a list of
  colors (at most two, one for foreground and one for background) and attributes
  (as many as you want), separated by spaces.
<p class="Pp">The basic colors accepted are <b>normal</b>, <b>black</b>,
    <b>red</b>, <b>green</b>, <b>yellow</b>, <b>blue</b>, <b>magenta</b>,
    <b>cyan</b>, <b>white</b> and <b>default</b>. The first color given is the
    foreground; the second is the background. All the basic colors except
    <b>normal</b> and <b>default</b> have a bright variant that can be specified
    by prefixing the color with <b>bright</b>, like <b>brightred</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The color <b>normal</b> makes no change to the color. It is the
    same as an empty string, but can be used as the foreground color when
    specifying a background color alone (for example, &quot;normal
  red&quot;).</p>
<p class="Pp">The color <b>default</b> explicitly resets the color to the
    terminal default, for example to specify a cleared background. Although it
    varies between terminals, this is usually not the same as setting to
    &quot;white black&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Colors may also be given as numbers between 0 and 255; these use
    ANSI 256-color mode (but note that not all terminals may support this). If
    your terminal supports it, you may also specify 24-bit RGB values as hex,
    like <b>#ff0ab3</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The accepted attributes are <b>bold</b>, <b>dim</b>, <b>ul</b>,
    <b>blink</b>, <b>reverse</b>, <b>italic</b>, and <b>strike</b> (for
    crossed-out or &quot;strikethrough&quot; letters). The position of any
    attributes with respect to the colors (before, after, or in between),
    doesn&#x2019;t matter. Specific attributes may be turned off by prefixing
    them with <b>no</b> or <b>no-</b> (e.g., <b>noreverse</b>, <b>no-ul</b>,
    etc).</p>
<p class="Pp">The pseudo-attribute <b>reset</b> resets all colors and attributes
    before applying the specified coloring. For example, <b>reset green</b> will
    result in a green foreground and default background without any active
    attributes.</p>
<p class="Pp">An empty color string produces no color effect at all. This can be
    used to avoid coloring specific elements without disabling color
  entirely.</p>
<p class="Pp">For git&#x2019;s pre-defined color slots, the attributes are meant
    to be reset at the beginning of each item in the colored output. So setting
    <b>color.decorate.branch</b> to <b>black</b> will paint that branch name in
    a plain <b>black</b>, even if the previous thing on the same output line
    (e.g. opening parenthesis before the list of branch names in <b>log
    --decorate</b> output) is set to be painted with <b>bold</b> or some other
    attribute. However, custom log formats may do more complicated and layered
    coloring, and the negated forms may be useful there.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">pathname</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A variable that takes a pathname value can be given a
  string that begins with &quot;<b>~/</b>&quot; or &quot;<b>~user/</b>&quot;,
  and the usual tilde expansion happens to such a string: <b>~/</b> is expanded
  to the value of <b>$HOME</b>, and <b>~user/</b> to the specified user&#x2019;s
  home directory.
<p class="Pp">If a path starts with <b>%(prefix)/</b>, the remainder is
    interpreted as a path relative to Git&#x2019;s &quot;runtime prefix&quot;,
    i.e. relative to the location where Git itself was installed. For example,
    <b>%(prefix)/bin/</b> refers to the directory in which the Git executable
    itself lives. If Git was compiled without runtime prefix support, the
    compiled-in prefix will be substituted instead. In the unlikely event that a
    literal path needs to be specified that should <i>not</i> be expanded, it
    needs to be prefixed by <b>./</b>, like so: <b>./%(prefix)/bin</b>.</p>

<p class="Pp">checkoutAmbiguousRemoteBranchName</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Advice shown when the argument to <b>git-checkout</b>(1)
  and <b>git-switch</b>(1) ambiguously resolves to a remote tracking branch on
  more than one remote in situations where an unambiguous argument would have
  otherwise caused a remote-tracking branch to be checked out. See the

<p class="Pp">ignoredHook</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Advice shown if a hook is ignored because the hook is not

</div>
<p class="Pp">core.fileMode</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Tells Git if the executable bit of files in the working
  tree is to be honored.
<p class="Pp">Some filesystems lose the executable bit when a file that is
    marked as executable is checked out, or checks out a non-executable file
    with executable bit on. <b>git-clone</b>(1) or <b>git-init</b>(1) probe the
    filesystem to see if it handles the executable bit correctly and this
    variable is automatically set as necessary.</p>
<p class="Pp">A repository, however, may be on a filesystem that handles the
    filemode correctly, and this variable is set to <i>true</i> when created,
    but later may be made accessible from another environment that loses the
    filemode (e.g. exporting ext4 via CIFS mount, visiting a Cygwin created
    repository with Git for Windows or Eclipse). In such a case it may be
    necessary to set this variable to <i>false</i>. See
    <b>git-update-index</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">The default is true (when core.filemode is not specified in the
    config file).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.hideDotFiles</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">(Windows-only) If true, mark newly-created directories
  and files whose name starts with a dot as hidden. If <i>dotGitOnly</i>, only
  the <b>.git/</b> directory is hidden, but no other files starting with a dot.
  The default mode is <i>dotGitOnly</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.ignoreCase</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Internal variable which enables various workarounds to
  enable Git to work better on filesystems that are not case sensitive, like
  APFS, HFS+, FAT, NTFS, etc. For example, if a directory listing finds
  &quot;makefile&quot; when Git expects &quot;Makefile&quot;, Git will assume it
  is really the same file, and continue to remember it as &quot;Makefile&quot;.
<p class="Pp">The default is false, except <b>git-clone</b>(1) or
    <b>git-init</b>(1) will probe and set core.ignoreCase true if appropriate
    when the repository is created.</p>
<p class="Pp">Git relies on the proper configuration of this variable for your
    operating and file system. Modifying this value may result in unexpected
    behavior.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.precomposeUnicode</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option is only used by Mac OS implementation of Git.
  When core.precomposeUnicode=true, Git reverts the unicode decomposition of
  filenames done by Mac OS. This is useful when sharing a repository between Mac
  OS and Linux or Windows. (Git for Windows 1.7.10 or higher is needed, or Git
  under cygwin 1.7). When false, file names are handled fully transparent by
  Git, which is backward compatible with older versions of Git.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.protectHFS</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, do not allow checkout of paths that would
  be considered equivalent to <b>.git</b> on an HFS+ filesystem. Defaults to
  <b>true</b> on Mac OS, and <b>false</b> elsewhere.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.protectNTFS</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, do not allow checkout of paths that would
  cause problems with the NTFS filesystem, e.g. conflict with 8.3
  &quot;short&quot; names. Defaults to <b>true</b> on Windows, and <b>false</b>
  elsewhere.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.fsmonitor</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, enable the built-in file system monitor
  daemon for this working directory (<b>git-fsmonitor--daemon</b>(1)).
<p class="Pp">Like hook-based file system monitors, the built-in file system
    monitor can speed up Git commands that need to refresh the Git index (e.g.
    <b>git status</b>) in a working directory with many files. The built-in
    monitor eliminates the need to install and maintain an external third-party
    tool.</p>
<p class="Pp">The built-in file system monitor is currently available only on a
    limited set of supported platforms. Currently, this includes Windows and
    MacOS.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
Otherwise, this variable contains the pathname of the &quot;fsmonitor&quot;
hook command.
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This hook command is used to identify all files that may have
    changed since the requested date/time. This information is used to speed up
    git by avoiding unnecessary scanning of files that have not changed.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the &quot;fsmonitor-watchman&quot; section of
    <b>githooks</b>(5).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that if you concurrently use multiple versions of Git, such
    as one version on the command line and another version in an IDE tool, that
    the definition of <b>core.fsmonitor</b> was extended to allow boolean values
    in addition to hook pathnames. Git versions 2.35.1 and prior will not
    understand the boolean values and will consider the &quot;true&quot; or
    &quot;false&quot; values as hook pathnames to be invoked. Git versions 2.26
    thru 2.35.1 default to hook protocol V2 and will fall back to no fsmonitor
    (full scan). Git versions prior to 2.26 default to hook protocol V1 and will
    silently assume there were no changes to report (no scan), so status
    commands may report incomplete results. For this reason, it is best to
    upgrade all of your Git versions before using the built-in file system
    monitor.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.fsmonitorHookVersion</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sets the protocol version to be used when invoking the
  &quot;fsmonitor&quot; hook.
<p class="Pp">There are currently versions 1 and 2. When this is not set,
    version 2 will be tried first and if it fails then version 1 will be tried.
    Version 1 uses a timestamp as input to determine which files have changes
    since that time but some monitors like Watchman have race conditions when
    used with a timestamp. Version 2 uses an opaque string so that the monitor
    can return something that can be used to determine what files have changed
    without race conditions.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.trustctime</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If false, the ctime differences between the index and the
  working tree are ignored; useful when the inode change time is regularly
  modified by something outside Git (file system crawlers and some backup
  systems). See <b>git-update-index</b>(1). True by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.splitIndex</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, the split-index feature of the index will be
  used. See <b>git-update-index</b>(1). False by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.untrackedCache</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Determines what to do about the untracked cache feature
  of the index. It will be kept, if this variable is unset or set to
  <b>keep</b>. It will automatically be added if set to <b>true</b>. And it will
  automatically be removed, if set to <b>false</b>. Before setting it to
  <b>true</b>, you should check that mtime is working properly on your system.
  See <b>git-update-index</b>(1). <b>keep</b> by default, unless
  <b>feature.manyFiles</b> is enabled which sets this setting to <b>true</b> by
  default.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.checkStat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When missing or is set to <b>default</b>, many fields in
  the stat structure are checked to detect if a file has been modified since Git
  looked at it. When this configuration variable is set to <b>minimal</b>,
  sub-second part of mtime and ctime, the uid and gid of the owner of the file,
  the inode number (and the device number, if Git was compiled to use it), are
  excluded from the check among these fields, leaving only the whole-second part
  of mtime (and ctime, if <b>core.trustCtime</b> is set) and the filesize to be
  checked.
<p class="Pp">There are implementations of Git that do not leave usable values
    in some fields (e.g. JGit); by excluding these fields from the comparison,
    the <b>minimal</b> mode may help interoperability when the same repository
    is used by these other systems at the same time.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.quotePath</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commands that output paths (e.g. <i>ls-files</i>,
  <i>diff</i>), will quote &quot;unusual&quot; characters in the pathname by
  enclosing the pathname in double-quotes and escaping those characters with
  backslashes in the same way C escapes control characters (e.g. <b>\t</b> for
  TAB, <b>\n</b> for LF, <b>\\</b> for backslash) or bytes with values larger
  than 0x80 (e.g. octal <b>\302\265</b> for &quot;micro&quot; in UTF-8). If this
  variable is set to false, bytes higher than 0x80 are not considered
  &quot;unusual&quot; any more. Double-quotes, backslash and control characters
  are always escaped regardless of the setting of this variable. A simple space
  character is not considered &quot;unusual&quot;. Many commands can output
  pathnames completely verbatim using the <b>-z</b> option. The default value is
  true.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.eol</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sets the line ending type to use in the working directory
  for files that are marked as text (either by having the <b>text</b> attribute
  set, or by having <b>text=auto</b> and Git auto-detecting the contents as
  text). Alternatives are <i>lf</i>, <i>crlf</i> and <i>native</i>, which uses
  the platform&#x2019;s native line ending. The default value is <b>native</b>.
  See <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for more information on end-of-line conversion.
  Note that this value is ignored if <b>core.autocrlf</b> is set to <b>true</b>
  or <b>input</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.safecrlf</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, makes Git check if converting <b>CRLF</b> is
  reversible when end-of-line conversion is active. Git will verify if a command
  modifies a file in the work tree either directly or indirectly. For example,
  committing a file followed by checking out the same file should yield the
  original file in the work tree. If this is not the case for the current
  setting of <b>core.autocrlf</b>, Git will reject the file. The variable can be
  set to &quot;warn&quot;, in which case Git will only warn about an
  irreversible conversion but continue the operation.
<p class="Pp">CRLF conversion bears a slight chance of corrupting data. When it
    is enabled, Git will convert CRLF to LF during commit and LF to CRLF during
    checkout. A file that contains a mixture of LF and CRLF before the commit
    cannot be recreated by Git. For text files this is the right thing to do: it
    corrects line endings such that we have only LF line endings in the
    repository. But for binary files that are accidentally classified as text
    the conversion can corrupt data.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you recognize such corruption early you can easily fix it by
    setting the conversion type explicitly in .gitattributes. Right after
    committing you still have the original file in your work tree and this file
    is not yet corrupted. You can explicitly tell Git that this file is binary
    and Git will handle the file appropriately.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unfortunately, the desired effect of cleaning up text files with
    mixed line endings and the undesired effect of corrupting binary files
    cannot be distinguished. In both cases CRLFs are removed in an irreversible
    way. For text files this is the right thing to do because CRLFs are line
    endings, while for binary files converting CRLFs corrupts data.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note, this safety check does not mean that a checkout will
    generate a file identical to the original file for a different setting of
    <b>core.eol</b> and <b>core.autocrlf</b>, but only for the current one. For
    example, a text file with <b>LF</b> would be accepted with
    <b>core.eol=lf</b> and could later be checked out with <b>core.eol=crlf</b>,
    in which case the resulting file would contain <b>CRLF</b>, although the
    original file contained <b>LF</b>. However, in both work trees the line
    endings would be consistent, that is either all <b>LF</b> or all
    <b>CRLF</b>, but never mixed. A file with mixed line endings would be
    reported by the <b>core.safecrlf</b> mechanism.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.autocrlf</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Setting this variable to &quot;true&quot; is the same as
  setting the <b>text</b> attribute to &quot;auto&quot; on all files and
  core.eol to &quot;crlf&quot;. Set to true if you want to have <b>CRLF</b> line
  endings in your working directory and the repository has LF line endings. This
  variable can be set to <i>input</i>, in which case no output conversion is
  performed.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.checkRoundtripEncoding</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A comma and/or whitespace separated list of encodings
  that Git performs UTF-8 round trip checks on if they are used in an
  <b>working-tree-encoding</b> attribute (see <b>gitattributes</b>(5)). The
  default value is <b>SHIFT-JIS</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.symlinks</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If false, symbolic links are checked out as small plain
  files that contain the link text. <b>git-update-index</b>(1) and
  <b>git-add</b>(1) will not change the recorded type to regular file. Useful on
  filesystems like FAT that do not support symbolic links.
<p class="Pp">The default is true, except <b>git-clone</b>(1) or
    <b>git-init</b>(1) will probe and set core.symlinks false if appropriate
    when the repository is created.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.gitProxy</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A &quot;proxy command&quot; to execute (as <i>command
  host port</i>) instead of establishing direct connection to the remote server
  when using the Git protocol for fetching. If the variable value is in the
  &quot;COMMAND for DOMAIN&quot; format, the command is applied only on
  hostnames ending with the specified domain string. This variable may be set
  multiple times and is matched in the given order; the first match wins.
<p class="Pp">Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_PROXY_COMMAND</b> environment
    variable (which always applies universally, without the special
    &quot;for&quot; handling).</p>
<p class="Pp">The special string <b>none</b> can be used as the proxy command to
    specify that no proxy be used for a given domain pattern. This is useful for
    excluding servers inside a firewall from proxy use, while defaulting to a
    common proxy for external domains.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.sshCommand</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If this variable is set, <b>git fetch</b> and <b>git
  push</b> will use the specified command instead of <b>ssh</b> when they need
  to connect to a remote system. The command is in the same form as the
  <b>GIT_SSH_COMMAND</b> environment variable and is overridden when the
  environment variable is set.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.ignoreStat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, Git will avoid using lstat() calls to detect if
  files have changed by setting the &quot;assume-unchanged&quot; bit for those
  tracked files which it has updated identically in both the index and working
  tree.
<p class="Pp">When files are modified outside of Git, the user will need to
    stage the modified files explicitly (e.g. see <i>Examples</i> section in
    <b>git-update-index</b>(1)). Git will not normally detect changes to those
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is useful on systems where lstat() calls are very slow, such
    as CIFS/Microsoft Windows.</p>
<p class="Pp">False by default.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.preferSymlinkRefs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of the default &quot;symref&quot; format for HEAD
  and other symbolic reference files, use symbolic links. This is sometimes
  needed to work with old scripts that expect HEAD to be a symbolic link.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.alternateRefsCommand</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When advertising tips of available history from an
  alternate, use the shell to execute the specified command instead of
  <b>git-for-each-ref</b>(1). The first argument is the absolute path of the
  alternate. Output must contain one hex object id per line (i.e., the same as
  produced by <b>git for-each-ref --format='%(objectname)'</b>).
<p class="Pp">Note that you cannot generally put <b>git for-each-ref</b>
    directly into the config value, as it does not take a repository path as an
    argument (but you can wrap the command above in a shell script).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.alternateRefsPrefixes</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When listing references from an alternate, list only
  references that begin with the given prefix. Prefixes match as if they were
  given as arguments to <b>git-for-each-ref</b>(1). To list multiple prefixes,
  separate them with whitespace. If <b>core.alternateRefsCommand</b> is set,
  setting <b>core.alternateRefsPrefixes</b> has no effect.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.bare</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true this repository is assumed to be <i>bare</i> and
  has no working directory associated with it. If this is the case a number of
  commands that require a working directory will be disabled, such as
  <b>git-add</b>(1) or <b>git-merge</b>(1).
<p class="Pp">This setting is automatically guessed by <b>git-clone</b>(1) or
    <b>git-init</b>(1) when the repository was created. By default a repository
    that ends in &quot;/.git&quot; is assumed to be not bare (bare = false),
    while all other repositories are assumed to be bare (bare = true).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.worktree</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the path to the root of the working tree. If
  <b>GIT_COMMON_DIR</b> environment variable is set, core.worktree is ignored
  and not used for determining the root of working tree. This can be overridden
  by the <b>GIT_WORK_TREE</b> environment variable and the <b>--work-tree</b>
  command-line option. The value can be an absolute path or relative to the path
  to the .git directory, which is either specified by --git-dir or GIT_DIR, or
  automatically discovered. If --git-dir or GIT_DIR is specified but none of
  --work-tree, GIT_WORK_TREE and core.worktree is specified, the current working
  directory is regarded as the top level of your working tree.
<p class="Pp">Note that this variable is honored even when set in a
    configuration file in a &quot;.git&quot; subdirectory of a directory and its
    value differs from the latter directory (e.g.
    &quot;/path/to/.git/config&quot; has core.worktree set to
    &quot;/different/path&quot;), which is most likely a misconfiguration.
    Running Git commands in the &quot;/path/to&quot; directory will still use
    &quot;/different/path&quot; as the root of the work tree and can cause
    confusion unless you know what you are doing (e.g. you are creating a
    read-only snapshot of the same index to a location different from the
    repository&#x2019;s usual working tree).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.logAllRefUpdates</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable the reflog. Updates to a ref &lt;ref&gt; is logged
  to the file &quot;<b>$GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;ref&gt;</b>&quot;, by appending the new
  and old SHA-1, the date/time and the reason of the update, but only when the
  file exists. If this configuration variable is set to <b>true</b>, missing
  &quot;<b>$GIT_DIR/logs/&lt;ref&gt;</b>&quot; file is automatically created for
  branch heads (i.e. under <b>refs/heads/</b>), remote refs (i.e. under
  <b>refs/remotes/</b>), note refs (i.e. under <b>refs/notes/</b>), and the
  symbolic ref <b>HEAD</b>. If it is set to <b>always</b>, then a missing reflog
  is automatically created for any ref under <b>refs/</b>.
<p class="Pp">This information can be used to determine what commit was the tip
    of a branch &quot;2 days ago&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">This value is true by default in a repository that has a working
    directory associated with it, and false by default in a bare repository.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.repositoryFormatVersion</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Internal variable identifying the repository format and
  layout version.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.sharedRepository</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <i>group</i> (or <i>true</i>), the repository is
  made shareable between several users in a group (making sure all the files and
  objects are group-writable). When <i>all</i> (or <i>world</i> or
  <i>everybody</i>), the repository will be readable by all users, additionally
  to being group-shareable. When <i>umask</i> (or <i>false</i>), Git will use
  permissions reported by umask(2). When <i>0xxx</i>, where <i>0xxx</i> is an
  octal number, files in the repository will have this mode value. <i>0xxx</i>
  will override user&#x2019;s umask value (whereas the other options will only
  override requested parts of the user&#x2019;s umask value). Examples:
  <i>0660</i> will make the repo read/write-able for the owner and group, but
  inaccessible to others (equivalent to <i>group</i> unless umask is e.g.
  <i>0022</i>). <i>0640</i> is a repository that is group-readable but not
  group-writable. See <b>git-init</b>(1). False by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.warnAmbiguousRefs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, Git will warn you if the ref name you passed it
  is ambiguous and might match multiple refs in the repository. True by
  default.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.compression</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An integer -1..9, indicating a default compression level.
  -1 is the zlib default. 0 means no compression, and 1..9 are various
  speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being slowest. If set, this provides a default to
  other compression variables, such as <b>core.looseCompression</b> and
  <b>pack.compression</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.looseCompression</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An integer -1..9, indicating the compression level for
  objects that are not in a pack file. -1 is the zlib default. 0 means no
  compression, and 1..9 are various speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being slowest. If
  not set, defaults to core.compression. If that is not set, defaults to 1 (best
  speed).</div>
<p class="Pp">core.packedGitWindowSize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Number of bytes of a pack file to map into memory in a
  single mapping operation. Larger window sizes may allow your system to process
  a smaller number of large pack files more quickly. Smaller window sizes will
  negatively affect performance due to increased calls to the operating
  system&#x2019;s memory manager, but may improve performance when accessing a
  large number of large pack files.
<p class="Pp">Default is 1 MiB if NO_MMAP was set at compile time, otherwise 32
    MiB on 32 bit platforms and 1 GiB on 64 bit platforms. This should be
    reasonable for all users/operating systems. You probably do not need to
    adjust this value.</p>
<p class="Pp">Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are
    supported.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.packedGitLimit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Maximum number of bytes to map simultaneously into memory
  from pack files. If Git needs to access more than this many bytes at once to
  complete an operation it will unmap existing regions to reclaim virtual
  address space within the process.
<p class="Pp">Default is 256 MiB on 32 bit platforms and 32 TiB (effectively
    unlimited) on 64 bit platforms. This should be reasonable for all
    users/operating systems, except on the largest projects. You probably do not
    need to adjust this value.</p>
<p class="Pp">Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are
    supported.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.deltaBaseCacheLimit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Maximum number of bytes per thread to reserve for caching
  base objects that may be referenced by multiple deltified objects. By storing
  the entire decompressed base objects in a cache Git is able to avoid unpacking
  and decompressing frequently used base objects multiple times.
<p class="Pp">Default is 96 MiB on all platforms. This should be reasonable for
    all users/operating systems, except on the largest projects. You probably do
    not need to adjust this value.</p>
<p class="Pp">Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are
    supported.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.bigFileThreshold</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Files larger than this size are stored deflated, without
  attempting delta compression. Storing large files without delta compression
  avoids excessive memory usage, at the slight expense of increased disk usage.
  Additionally files larger than this size are always treated as binary.
<p class="Pp">Default is 512 MiB on all platforms. This should be reasonable for
    most projects as source code and other text files can still be delta
    compressed, but larger binary media files won&#x2019;t be.</p>
<p class="Pp">Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are
    supported.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.excludesFile</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the pathname to the file that contains patterns
  to describe paths that are not meant to be tracked, in addition to
  <b>.gitignore</b> (per-directory) and <b>.git/info/exclude</b>. Defaults to
  <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore</b>. If <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b> is either not
  set or empty, <b>$HOME/.config/git/ignore</b> is used instead. See
  <b>gitignore</b>(5).</div>
<p class="Pp">core.askPass</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Some commands (e.g. svn and http interfaces) that
  interactively ask for a password can be told to use an external program given
  via the value of this variable. Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_ASKPASS</b>
  environment variable. If not set, fall back to the value of the
  <b>SSH_ASKPASS</b> environment variable or, failing that, a simple password
  prompt. The external program shall be given a suitable prompt as command-line
  argument and write the password on its STDOUT.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.attributesFile</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to <b>.gitattributes</b> (per-directory) and
  <b>.git/info/attributes</b>, Git looks into this file for attributes (see
  <b>gitattributes</b>(5)). Path expansions are made the same way as for
  <b>core.excludesFile</b>. Its default value is
  <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/attributes</b>. If <b>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</b> is either
  not set or empty, <b>$HOME/.config/git/attributes</b> is used instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.hooksPath</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default Git will look for your hooks in the
  <b>$GIT_DIR/hooks</b> directory. Set this to different path, e.g.
  <b>/etc/git/hooks</b>, and Git will try to find your hooks in that directory,
  e.g. <b>/etc/git/hooks/pre-receive</b> instead of in
  <b>$GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-receive</b>.
<p class="Pp">The path can be either absolute or relative. A relative path is
    taken as relative to the directory where the hooks are run (see the
    &quot;DESCRIPTION&quot; section of <b>githooks</b>(5)).</p>
<p class="Pp">This configuration variable is useful in cases where you&#x2019;d
    like to centrally configure your Git hooks instead of configuring them on a
    per-repository basis, or as a more flexible and centralized alternative to
    having an <b>init.templateDir</b> where you&#x2019;ve changed default
  hooks.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.editor</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commands such as <b>commit</b> and <b>tag</b> that let
  you edit messages by launching an editor use the value of this variable when
  it is set, and the environment variable <b>GIT_EDITOR</b> is not set. See
  <b>git-var</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">core.commentChar</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commands such as <b>commit</b> and <b>tag</b> that let
  you edit messages consider a line that begins with this character commented,
  and removes them after the editor returns (default <i>#</i>).
<p class="Pp">If set to &quot;auto&quot;, <b>git-commit</b> would select a
    character that is not the beginning character of any line in existing commit
    messages.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.filesRefLockTimeout</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The length of time, in milliseconds, to retry when trying
  to lock an individual reference. Value 0 means not to retry at all; -1 means
  to try indefinitely. Default is 100 (i.e., retry for 100ms).</div>
<p class="Pp">core.packedRefsTimeout</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The length of time, in milliseconds, to retry when trying
  to lock the <b>packed-refs</b> file. Value 0 means not to retry at all; -1
  means to try indefinitely. Default is 1000 (i.e., retry for 1 second).</div>
<p class="Pp">core.pager</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Text viewer for use by Git commands (e.g., <i>less</i>).
  The value is meant to be interpreted by the shell. The order of preference is
  the <b>$GIT_PAGER</b> environment variable, then <b>core.pager</b>
  configuration, then <b>$PAGER</b>, and then the default chosen at compile time
  (usually <i>less</i>).
<p class="Pp">When the <b>LESS</b> environment variable is unset, Git sets it to
    <b>FRX</b> (if <b>LESS</b> environment variable is set, Git does not change
    it at all). If you want to selectively override Git&#x2019;s default setting
    for <b>LESS</b>, you can set <b>core.pager</b> to e.g. <b>less -S</b>. This
    will be passed to the shell by Git, which will translate the final command
    to <b>LESS=FRX less -S</b>. The environment does not set the <b>S</b> option
    but the command line does, instructing less to truncate long lines.
    Similarly, setting <b>core.pager</b> to <b>less -+F</b> will deactivate the
    <b>F</b> option specified by the environment from the command-line,
    deactivating the &quot;quit if one screen&quot; behavior of <b>less</b>. One
    can specifically activate some flags for particular commands: for example,
    setting <b>pager.blame</b> to <b>less -S</b> enables line truncation only
    for <b>git blame</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Likewise, when the <b>LV</b> environment variable is unset, Git
    sets it to <b>-c</b>. You can override this setting by exporting <b>LV</b>
    with another value or setting <b>core.pager</b> to <b>lv +c</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.whitespace</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A comma separated list of common whitespace problems to
  notice. <i>git diff</i> will use <b>color.diff.whitespace</b> to highlight
  them, and <i>git apply --whitespace=error</i> will consider them as errors.
  You can prefix <b>-</b> to disable any of them (e.g. <b>-trailing-space</b>):
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>blank-at-eol</b> treats trailing whitespaces
  at the end of the line as an error (enabled by default).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>space-before-tab</b> treats a space character
  that appears immediately before a tab character in the initial indent part of
  the line as an error (enabled by default).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>indent-with-non-tab</b> treats a line that is
  indented with space characters instead of the equivalent tabs as an error (not
  enabled by default).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>tab-in-indent</b> treats a tab character in
  the initial indent part of the line as an error (not enabled by
  default).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>blank-at-eof</b> treats blank lines added at
  the end of file as an error (enabled by default).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>trailing-space</b> is a short-hand to cover
  both <b>blank-at-eol</b> and <b>blank-at-eof</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>cr-at-eol</b> treats a carriage-return at the
  end of line as part of the line terminator, i.e. with it,
  <b>trailing-space</b> does not trigger if the character before such a
  carriage-return is not a whitespace (not enabled by default).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>tabwidth=&lt;n&gt;</b> tells how many
  character positions a tab occupies; this is relevant for
  <b>indent-with-non-tab</b> and when Git fixes <b>tab-in-indent</b> errors. The
  default tab width is 8. Allowed values are 1 to 63.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.fsync</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A comma-separated list of components of the repository
  that should be hardened via the core.fsyncMethod when created or modified. You
  can disable hardening of any component by prefixing it with a <i>-</i>. Items
  that are not hardened may be lost in the event of an unclean system shutdown.
  Unless you have special requirements, it is recommended that you leave this
  option empty or pick one of <b>committed</b>, <b>added</b>, or <b>all</b>.
<p class="Pp">When this configuration is encountered, the set of components
    starts with the platform default value, disabled components are removed, and
    additional components are added. <b>none</b> resets the state so that the
    platform default is ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">The empty string resets the fsync configuration to the platform
    default. The default on most platforms is equivalent to
    <b>core.fsync=committed,-loose-object</b>, which has good performance, but
    risks losing recent work in the event of an unclean system shutdown.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>none</b> clears the set of fsynced
  components.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>loose-object</b> hardens objects added to the
  repo in loose-object form.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>pack</b> hardens objects added to the repo in
  packfile form.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>pack-metadata</b> hardens packfile bitmaps and
  indexes.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>commit-graph</b> hardens the commit graph
  file.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>index</b> hardens the index when it is
  modified.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>objects</b> is an aggregate option that is
  equivalent to <b>loose-object,pack</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>reference</b> hardens references modified in
  the repo.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>derived-metadata</b> is an aggregate option
  that is equivalent to <b>pack-metadata,commit-graph</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>committed</b> is an aggregate option that is
  currently equivalent to <b>objects</b>. This mode sacrifices some performance
  to ensure that work that is committed to the repository with <b>git commit</b>
  or similar commands is hardened.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>added</b> is an aggregate option that is
  currently equivalent to <b>committed,index</b>. This mode sacrifices
  additional performance to ensure that the results of commands like <b>git
  add</b> and similar operations are hardened.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>all</b> is an aggregate option that syncs all
  individual components above.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.fsyncMethod</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A value indicating the strategy Git will use to harden
  repository data using fsync and related primitives.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>fsync</b> uses the fsync() system call or
  platform equivalents.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>writeout-only</b> issues pagecache writeback
  requests, but depending on the filesystem and storage hardware, data added to
  the repository may not be durable in the event of a system crash. This is the
  default mode on macOS.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>batch</b> enables a mode that uses
  writeout-only flushes to stage multiple updates in the disk writeback cache
  and then does a single full fsync of a dummy file to trigger the disk cache
  flush at the end of the operation.
<p class="Pp">Currently <b>batch</b> mode only applies to loose-object files.
    Other repository data is made durable as if <b>fsync</b> was specified. This
    mode is expected to be as safe as <b>fsync</b> on macOS for repos stored on
    HFS+ or APFS filesystems and on Windows for repos stored on NTFS or ReFS
    filesystems.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.fsyncObjectFiles</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This boolean will enable <i>fsync()</i> when writing
  object files. This setting is deprecated. Use core.fsync instead.
<p class="Pp">This setting affects data added to the Git repository in
    loose-object form. When set to true, Git will issue an fsync or similar
    system call to flush caches so that loose-objects remain consistent in the
    face of a unclean system shutdown.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.preloadIndex</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable parallel index preload for operations like <i>git
  diff</i>
<p class="Pp">This can speed up operations like <i>git diff</i> and <i>git
    status</i> especially on filesystems like NFS that have weak caching
    semantics and thus relatively high IO latencies. When enabled, Git will do
    the index comparison to the filesystem data in parallel, allowing
    overlapping IO&#x2019;s. Defaults to true.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.unsetenvvars</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Windows-only: comma-separated list of environment
  variables' names that need to be unset before spawning any other process.
  Defaults to <b>PERL5LIB</b> to account for the fact that Git for Windows
  insists on using its own Perl interpreter.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.restrictinheritedhandles</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Windows-only: override whether spawned processes inherit
  only standard file handles (<b>stdin</b>, <b>stdout</b> and <b>stderr</b>) or
  all handles. Can be <b>auto</b>, <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>. Defaults to
  <b>auto</b>, which means <b>true</b> on Windows 7 and later, and <b>false</b>
  on older Windows versions.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.createObject</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">You can set this to <i>link</i>, in which case a hardlink
  followed by a delete of the source are used to make sure that object creation
  will not overwrite existing objects.
<p class="Pp">On some file system/operating system combinations, this is
    unreliable. Set this config setting to <i>rename</i> there; However, This
    will remove the check that makes sure that existing object files will not
    get overwritten.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.notesRef</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When showing commit messages, also show notes which are
  stored in the given ref. The ref must be fully qualified. If the given ref
  does not exist, it is not an error but means that no notes should be printed.
<p class="Pp">This setting defaults to &quot;refs/notes/commits&quot;, and it
    can be overridden by the <b>GIT_NOTES_REF</b> environment variable. See
    <b>git-notes</b>(1).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">core.commitGraph</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, then git will read the commit-graph file (if it
  exists) to parse the graph structure of commits. Defaults to true. See
  <b>git-commit-graph</b>(1) for more information.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.useReplaceRefs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to <b>false</b>, behave as if the
  <b>--no-replace-objects</b> option was given on the command line. See
  <b>git</b>(1) and <b>git-replace</b>(1) for more information.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.multiPackIndex</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use the multi-pack-index file to track multiple packfiles
  using a single index. See <b>git-multi-pack-index</b>(1) for more information.
  Defaults to true.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.sparseCheckout</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable &quot;sparse checkout&quot; feature. See
  <b>git-sparse-checkout</b>(1) for more information.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.sparseCheckoutCone</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enables the &quot;cone mode&quot; of the sparse checkout
  feature. When the sparse-checkout file contains a limited set of patterns,
  this mode provides significant performance advantages. The &quot;non cone
  mode&quot; can be requested to allow specifying a more flexible patterns by
  setting this variable to <i>false</i>. See <b>git-sparse-checkout</b>(1) for
  more information.</div>
<p class="Pp">core.abbrev</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the length object names are abbreviated to. If
  unspecified or set to &quot;auto&quot;, an appropriate value is computed based
  on the approximate number of packed objects in your repository, which
  hopefully is enough for abbreviated object names to stay unique for some time.
  If set to &quot;no&quot;, no abbreviation is made and the object names are
  shown in their full length. The minimum length is 4.</div>
<p class="Pp">add.ignoreErrors, add.ignore-errors (deprecated)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Tells <i>git add</i> to continue adding files when some
  files cannot be added due to indexing errors. Equivalent to the
  <b>--ignore-errors</b> option of <b>git-add</b>(1). <b>add.ignore-errors</b>
  is deprecated, as it does not follow the usual naming convention for
  configuration variables.</div>
<p class="Pp">add.interactive.useBuiltin</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set to <b>false</b> to fall back to the original Perl
  implementation of the interactive version of <b>git-add</b>(1) instead of the
  built-in version. Is <b>true</b> by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">alias.*</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Command aliases for the <b>git</b>(1) command wrapper -
  e.g. after defining <b>alias.last = cat-file commit HEAD</b>, the invocation
  <b>git last</b> is equivalent to <b>git cat-file commit HEAD</b>. To avoid
  confusion and troubles with script usage, aliases that hide existing Git
  commands are ignored. Arguments are split by spaces, the usual shell quoting
  and escaping is supported. A quote pair or a backslash can be used to quote
  them.
<p class="Pp">Note that the first word of an alias does not necessarily have to
    be a command. It can be a command-line option that will be passed into the
    invocation of <b>git</b>. In particular, this is useful when used with
    <b>-c</b> to pass in one-time configurations or <b>-p</b> to force
    pagination. For example, <b>loud-rebase = -c commit.verbose=true rebase</b>
    can be defined such that running <b>git loud-rebase</b> would be equivalent
    to <b>git -c commit.verbose=true rebase</b>. Also, <b>ps = -p status</b>
    would be a helpful alias since <b>git ps</b> would paginate the output of
    <b>git status</b> where the original command does not.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the alias expansion is prefixed with an exclamation point, it
    will be treated as a shell command. For example, defining <b>alias.new =
    !gitk --all --not ORIG_HEAD</b>, the invocation <b>git new</b> is equivalent
    to running the shell command <b>gitk --all --not ORIG_HEAD</b>. Note that
    shell commands will be executed from the top-level directory of a
    repository, which may not necessarily be the current directory.
    <b>GIT_PREFIX</b> is set as returned by running <b>git rev-parse
    --show-prefix</b> from the original current directory. See
    <b>git-rev-parse</b>(1).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">am.keepcr</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, git-am will call git-mailsplit for patches in
  mbox format with parameter <b>--keep-cr</b>. In this case git-mailsplit will
  not remove <b>\r</b> from lines ending with <b>\r\n</b>. Can be overridden by
  giving <b>--no-keep-cr</b> from the command line. See <b>git-am</b>(1),
  <b>git-mailsplit</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">am.threeWay</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, <b>git am</b> will fail if the patch does not
  apply cleanly. When set to true, this setting tells <b>git am</b> to fall back
  on 3-way merge if the patch records the identity of blobs it is supposed to
  apply to and we have those blobs available locally (equivalent to giving the
  <b>--3way</b> option from the command line). Defaults to <b>false</b>. See
  <b>git-am</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">apply.ignoreWhitespace</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When set to <i>change</i>, tells <i>git apply</i> to
  ignore changes in whitespace, in the same way as the
  <b>--ignore-space-change</b> option. When set to one of: no, none, never,
  false tells <i>git apply</i> to respect all whitespace differences. See
  <b>git-apply</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">apply.whitespace</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Tells <i>git apply</i> how to handle whitespaces, in the
  same way as the <b>--whitespace</b> option. See <b>git-apply</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">blame.blankBoundary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show blank commit object name for boundary commits in
  <b>git-blame</b>(1). This option defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">blame.coloring</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This determines the coloring scheme to be applied to
  blame output. It can be <i>repeatedLines</i>, <i>highlightRecent</i>, or
  <i>none</i> which is the default.</div>
<p class="Pp">blame.date</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the format used to output dates in
  <b>git-blame</b>(1). If unset the iso format is used. For supported values,
  see the discussion of the <b>--date</b> option at <b>git-log</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">blame.showEmail</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the author email instead of author name in
  <b>git-blame</b>(1). This option defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">blame.showRoot</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not treat root commits as boundaries in
  <b>git-blame</b>(1). This option defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">blame.ignoreRevsFile</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore revisions listed in the file, one unabbreviated
  object name per line, in <b>git-blame</b>(1). Whitespace and comments
  beginning with <b>#</b> are ignored. This option may be repeated multiple
  times. Empty file names will reset the list of ignored revisions. This option
  will be handled before the command line option
  <b>--ignore-revs-file</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">blame.markUnblamableLines</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Mark lines that were changed by an ignored revision that
  we could not attribute to another commit with a <i>*</i> in the output of
  <b>git-blame</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">blame.markIgnoredLines</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Mark lines that were changed by an ignored revision that
  we attributed to another commit with a <i>?</i> in the output of
  <b>git-blame</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">branch.autoSetupMerge</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Tells <i>git branch</i>, <i>git switch</i> and <i>git
  checkout</i> to set up new branches so that <b>git-pull</b>(1) will
  appropriately merge from the starting point branch. Note that even if this
  option is not set, this behavior can be chosen per-branch using the
  <b>--track</b> and <b>--no-track</b> options. The valid settings are:
  <b>false</b> &#x2014; no automatic setup is done; <b>true</b> &#x2014;
  automatic setup is done when the starting point is a remote-tracking branch;
  <b>always</b> &#x2014; automatic setup is done when the starting point is
  either a local branch or remote-tracking branch; <b>inherit</b> &#x2014; if
  the starting point has a tracking configuration, it is copied to the new
  branch; <b>simple</b> &#x2014; automatic setup is done only when the starting
  point is a remote-tracking branch and the new branch has the same name as the
  remote branch. This option defaults to true.</div>
<p class="Pp">branch.autoSetupRebase</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When a new branch is created with <i>git branch</i>,
  <i>git switch</i> or <i>git checkout</i> that tracks another branch, this
  variable tells Git to set up pull to rebase instead of merge (see
  &quot;branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase&quot;). When <b>never</b>, rebase is never
  automatically set to true. When <b>local</b>, rebase is set to true for
  tracked branches of other local branches. When <b>remote</b>, rebase is set to
  true for tracked branches of remote-tracking branches. When <b>always</b>,
  rebase will be set to true for all tracking branches. See
  &quot;branch.autoSetupMerge&quot; for details on how to set up a branch to
  track another branch. This option defaults to never.</div>
<p class="Pp">branch.sort</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This variable controls the sort ordering of branches when
  displayed by <b>git-branch</b>(1). Without the
  &quot;--sort=&lt;value&gt;&quot; option provided, the value of this variable
  will be used as the default. See <b>git-for-each-ref</b>(1) field names for
  valid values.</div>
<p class="Pp">branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When on branch &lt;name&gt;, it tells <i>git fetch</i>
  and <i>git push</i> which remote to fetch from/push to. The remote to push to
  may be overridden with <b>remote.pushDefault</b> (for all branches). The
  remote to push to, for the current branch, may be further overridden by
  <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.pushRemote</b>. If no remote is configured, or if you
  are not on any branch and there is more than one remote defined in the
  repository, it defaults to <b>origin</b> for fetching and
  <b>remote.pushDefault</b> for pushing. Additionally, <b>.</b> (a period) is
  the current local repository (a dot-repository), see
  <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</b>'s final note below.</div>
<p class="Pp">branch.&lt;name&gt;.pushRemote</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When on branch &lt;name&gt;, it overrides
  <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</b> for pushing. It also overrides
  <b>remote.pushDefault</b> for pushing from branch &lt;name&gt;. When you pull
  from one place (e.g. your upstream) and push to another place (e.g. your own
  publishing repository), you would want to set <b>remote.pushDefault</b> to
  specify the remote to push to for all branches, and use this option to
  override it for a specific branch.</div>
<p class="Pp">branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Defines, together with branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote, the
  upstream branch for the given branch. It tells <i>git fetch</i>/<i>git
  pull</i>/<i>git rebase</i> which branch to merge and can also affect <i>git
  push</i> (see push.default). When in branch &lt;name&gt;, it tells <i>git
  fetch</i> the default refspec to be marked for merging in FETCH_HEAD. The
  value is handled like the remote part of a refspec, and must match a ref which
  is fetched from the remote given by &quot;branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote&quot;.
  The merge information is used by <i>git pull</i> (which at first calls <i>git
  fetch</i>) to lookup the default branch for merging. Without this option,
  <i>git pull</i> defaults to merge the first refspec fetched. Specify multiple
  values to get an octopus merge. If you wish to setup <i>git pull</i> so that
  it merges into &lt;name&gt; from another branch in the local repository, you
  can point branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge to the desired branch, and use the
  relative path setting <b>.</b> (a period) for
  branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote.</div>
<p class="Pp">branch.&lt;name&gt;.mergeOptions</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sets default options for merging into branch
  &lt;name&gt;. The syntax and supported options are the same as those of
  <b>git-merge</b>(1), but option values containing whitespace characters are
  currently not supported.</div>
<p class="Pp">branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When true, rebase the branch &lt;name&gt; on top of the
  fetched branch, instead of merging the default branch from the default remote
  when &quot;git pull&quot; is run. See &quot;pull.rebase&quot; for doing this
  in a non branch-specific manner.
<p class="Pp">When <b>merges</b> (or just <i>m</i>), pass the
    <b>--rebase-merges</b> option to <i>git rebase</i> so that the local merge
    commits are included in the rebase (see <b>git-rebase</b>(1) for
  details).</p>
<p class="Pp">When the value is <b>interactive</b> (or just <i>i</i>), the
    rebase is run in interactive mode.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b>: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do <b>not</b>
    use it unless you understand the implications (see <b>git-rebase</b>(1) for
    details).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">branch.&lt;name&gt;.description</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Branch description, can be edited with <b>git branch
  --edit-description</b>. Branch description is automatically added in the
  format-patch cover letter or request-pull summary.</div>
<p class="Pp">browser.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the command to invoke the specified browser. The
  specified command is evaluated in shell with the URLs passed as arguments.
  (See <b>git-web--browse</b>(1).)</div>
<p class="Pp">browser.&lt;tool&gt;.path</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Override the path for the given tool that may be used to
  browse HTML help (see <b>-w</b> option in <b>git-help</b>(1)) or a working
  repository in gitweb (see <b>git-instaweb</b>(1)).</div>
<p class="Pp">checkout.defaultRemote</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When you run <b>git checkout &lt;something&gt;</b> or
  <b>git switch &lt;something&gt;</b> and only have one remote, it may
  implicitly fall back on checking out and tracking e.g.
  <b>origin/&lt;something&gt;</b>. This stops working as soon as you have more
  than one remote with a <b>&lt;something&gt;</b> reference. This setting allows
  for setting the name of a preferred remote that should always win when it
  comes to disambiguation. The typical use-case is to set this to <b>origin</b>.
<p class="Pp">Currently this is used by <b>git-switch</b>(1) and
    <b>git-checkout</b>(1) when <b>git checkout &lt;something&gt;</b> or <b>git
    switch &lt;something&gt;</b> will checkout the <b>&lt;something&gt;</b>
    branch on another remote, and by <b>git-worktree</b>(1) when <b>git worktree
    add</b> refers to a remote branch. This setting might be used for other
    checkout-like commands or functionality in the future.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">checkout.guess</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Provides the default value for the <b>--guess</b> or
  <b>--no-guess</b> option in <b>git checkout</b> and <b>git switch</b>. See
  <b>git-switch</b>(1) and <b>git-checkout</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">checkout.workers</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The number of parallel workers to use when updating the
  working tree. The default is one, i.e. sequential execution. If set to a value
  less than one, Git will use as many workers as the number of logical cores
  available. This setting and <b>checkout.thresholdForParallelism</b> affect all
  commands that perform checkout. E.g. checkout, clone, reset, sparse-checkout,
  etc.
<p class="Pp">Note: parallel checkout usually delivers better performance for
    repositories located on SSDs or over NFS. For repositories on spinning disks
    and/or machines with a small number of cores, the default sequential
    checkout often performs better. The size and compression level of a
    repository might also influence how well the parallel version performs.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">checkout.thresholdForParallelism</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When running parallel checkout with a small number of
  files, the cost of subprocess spawning and inter-process communication might
  outweigh the parallelization gains. This setting allows to define the minimum
  number of files for which parallel checkout should be attempted. The default
  is 100.</div>
<p class="Pp">clean.requireForce</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A boolean to make git-clean do nothing unless given -f,
  -i or -n. Defaults to true.</div>
<p class="Pp">clone.defaultRemoteName</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The name of the remote to create when cloning a
  repository. Defaults to <b>origin</b>, and can be overridden by passing the
  <b>--origin</b> command-line option to <b>git-clone</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">clone.rejectShallow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Reject to clone a repository if it is a shallow one, can
  be overridden by passing option <b>--reject-shallow</b> in command line. See
  <b>git-clone</b>(1)</div>
<p class="Pp">clone.filterSubmodules</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If a partial clone filter is provided (see
  <b>--filter</b> in <b>git-rev-list</b>(1)) and <b>--recurse-submodules</b> is
  used, also apply the filter to submodules.</div>
<p class="Pp">color.advice</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A boolean to enable/disable color in hints (e.g. when a
  push failed, see <b>advice.*</b> for a list). May be set to <b>always</b>,
  <b>false</b> (or <b>never</b>) or <b>auto</b> (or <b>true</b>), in which case
  colors are used only when the error output goes to a terminal. If unset, then
  the value of <b>color.ui</b> is used (<b>auto</b> by default).</div>
<p class="Pp">color.advice.hint</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use customized color for hints.</div>
<p class="Pp">color.blame.highlightRecent</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the line annotation color for <b>git blame
  --color-by-age</b> depending upon the age of the line.
<p class="Pp">This setting should be set to a comma-separated list of color and
    date settings, starting and ending with a color, the dates should be set
    from oldest to newest. The metadata will be colored with the specified
    colors if the line was introduced before the given timestamp, overwriting
    older timestamped colors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Instead of an absolute timestamp relative timestamps work as well,
    e.g. <b>2.weeks.ago</b> is valid to address anything older than 2 weeks.</p>
<p class="Pp">It defaults to <b>blue,12 month ago,white,1 month ago,red</b>,
    which colors everything older than one year blue, recent changes between one
    month and one year old are kept white, and lines introduced within the last
    month are colored red.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">color.blame.repeatedLines</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use the specified color to colorize line annotations for
  <b>git blame --color-lines</b>, if they come from the same commit as the
  preceding line. Defaults to cyan.</div>
<p class="Pp">color.branch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A boolean to enable/disable color in the output of
  <b>git-branch</b>(1). May be set to <b>always</b>, <b>false</b> (or
  <b>never</b>) or <b>auto</b> (or <b>true</b>), in which case colors are used
  only when the output is to a terminal. If unset, then the value of
  <b>color.ui</b> is used (<b>auto</b> by default).</div>
<p class="Pp">color.branch.&lt;slot&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use customized color for branch coloration.
  <b>&lt;slot&gt;</b> is one of <b>current</b> (the current branch),

  (other refs).</div>
<p class="Pp">color.diff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether to use ANSI escape sequences to add color to
  patches. If this is set to <b>always</b>, <b>git-diff</b>(1),
  <b>git-log</b>(1), and <b>git-show</b>(1) will use color for all patches. If
  it is set to <b>true</b> or <b>auto</b>, those commands will only use color
  when output is to the terminal. If unset, then the value of <b>color.ui</b> is
  used (<b>auto</b> by default).
<p class="Pp">This does not affect <b>git-format-patch</b>(1) or the
    <i>git-diff-*</i> plumbing commands. Can be overridden on the command line
    with the <b>--color[=&lt;when&gt;]</b> option.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">color.diff.&lt;slot&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use customized color for diff colorization.

  <b>git-range-diff</b>(1) for details).</div>
<p class="Pp">color.decorate.&lt;slot&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use customized color for <i>git log --decorate</i>
  output. <b>&lt;slot&gt;</b> is one of <b>branch</b>, <b>remoteBranch</b>,
  <b>tag</b>, <b>stash</b> or <b>HEAD</b> for local branches, remote-tracking
  branches, tags, stash and HEAD, respectively and <b>grafted</b> for grafted
  commits.</div>
<p class="Pp">color.grep</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When set to <b>always</b>, always highlight matches. When
  <b>false</b> (or <b>never</b>), never. When set to <b>true</b> or <b>auto</b>,

<p class="Pp">color.ui</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This variable determines the default value for variables
  such as <b>color.diff</b> and <b>color.grep</b> that control the use of color
  per command family. Its scope will expand as more commands learn configuration
  to set a default for the <b>--color</b> option. Set it to <b>false</b> or
  <b>never</b> if you prefer Git commands not to use color unless enabled
  explicitly with some other configuration or the <b>--color</b> option. Set it
  to <b>always</b> if you want all output not intended for machine consumption
  to use color, to <b>true</b> or <b>auto</b> (this is the default since Git

<div class="Bd-indent">never show in columns</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>auto</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">show in columns if the output is to the terminal</div>

<p class="Pp">commit.cleanup</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This setting overrides the default of the
  <b>--cleanup</b> option in <b>git commit</b>. See <b>git-commit</b>(1) for
  details. Changing the default can be useful when you always want to keep lines
  that begin with comment character <b>#</b> in your log message, in which case
  you would do <b>git config commit.cleanup whitespace</b> (note that you will
  have to remove the help lines that begin with <b>#</b> in the commit log
  template yourself, if you do this).</div>
<p class="Pp">commit.gpgSign</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A boolean to specify whether all commits should be GPG
  signed. Use of this option when doing operations such as rebase can result in

<p class="Pp">commitGraph.readChangedPaths</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, then git will use the changed-path Bloom filters
  in the commit-graph file (if it exists, and they are present). Defaults to
  true. See <b>git-commit-graph</b>(1) for more information.</div>
<p class="Pp">credential.helper</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify an external helper to be called when a username
  or password credential is needed; the helper may consult external storage to
  avoid prompting the user for the credentials. This is normally the name of a
  credential helper with possible arguments, but may also be an absolute path
  with arguments or, if preceded by <b>!</b>, shell commands.
<p class="Pp">Note that multiple helpers may be defined. See
    <b>gitcredentials</b>(7) for details and examples.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">credential.useHttpPath</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When acquiring credentials, consider the &quot;path&quot;

  <b>gitcredentials</b>(7) for more information.</div>
<p class="Pp">credential.username</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If no username is set for a network authentication, use

<p class="Pp">credential.&lt;url&gt;.*</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Any of the credential.* options above can be applied
  selectively to some credentials. For example
  &quot;credential.https://example.com.username&quot; would set the default
  username only for https connections to example.com. See
  <b>gitcredentials</b>(7) for details on how URLs are matched.</div>
<p class="Pp">credentialCache.ignoreSIGHUP</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Tell git-credential-cache&#x2014;daemon to ignore SIGHUP,
  instead of quitting.</div>
<p class="Pp">credentialStore.lockTimeoutMS</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The length of time, in milliseconds, for
  git-credential-store to retry when trying to lock the credentials file. Value
  0 means not to retry at all; -1 means to try indefinitely. Default is 1000
  (i.e., retry for 1s).</div>
<p class="Pp">completion.commands</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is only used by git-completion.bash to add or remove
  commands from the list of completed commands. Normally only porcelain commands
  and a few select others are completed. You can add more commands, separated by
  space, in this variable. Prefixing the command with <i>-</i> will remove it
  from the existing list.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.autoRefreshIndex</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When using <i>git diff</i> to compare with work tree
  files, do not consider stat-only change as changed. Instead, silently run
  <b>git update-index --refresh</b> to update the cached stat information for
  paths whose contents in the work tree match the contents in the index. This
  option defaults to true. Note that this affects only <i>git diff</i>
  Porcelain, and not lower level <i>diff</i> commands such as <i>git
  diff-files</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.dirstat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A comma separated list of <b>--dirstat</b> parameters
  specifying the default behavior of the <b>--dirstat</b> option to
  <b>git-diff</b>(1) and friends. The defaults can be overridden on the command
  line (using <b>--dirstat=&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;</b>). The fallback defaults
  (when not changed by <b>diff.dirstat</b>) are <b>changes,noncumulative,3</b>.
  The following parameters are available:
<p class="Pp"><b>changes</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that
  have been removed from the source, or added to the destination. This ignores
  the amount of pure code movements within a file. In other words, rearranging
  lines in a file is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default
  behavior when no parameter is given.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>lines</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular
  line-based diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts. (For
  binary files, count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural
  concept of lines). This is a more expensive <b>--dirstat</b> behavior than the
  <b>changes</b> behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as
  much as other changes. The resulting output is consistent with what you get
  from the other <b>--*stat</b> options.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>files</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of
  files changed. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis. This
  is the computationally cheapest <b>--dirstat</b> behavior, since it does not
  have to look at the file contents at all.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>cumulative</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Count changes in a child directory for the parent
  directory as well. Note that when using <b>cumulative</b>, the sum of the
  percentages reported may exceed 100%. The default (non-cumulative) behavior
  can be specified with the <b>noncumulative</b> parameter.</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;limit&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by
  default). Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes
  are not shown in the output.</div>
<p class="Pp">Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring
    directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and
    accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
    <b>files,10,cumulative</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.statGraphWidth</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Limit the width of the graph part in --stat output. If
  set, applies to all commands generating --stat output except
  format-patch.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.context</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of
  the default of 3. This value is overridden by the -U option.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.interHunkContext</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified
  number of lines, thereby fusing the hunks that are close to each other. This
  value serves as the default for the <b>--inter-hunk-context</b> command line
  option.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.external</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If this config variable is set, diff generation is not
  performed using the internal diff machinery, but using the given command. Can
  be overridden with the &#x2018;GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF&#x2019; environment variable.
  The command is called with parameters as described under &quot;git Diffs&quot;
  in <b>git</b>(1). Note: if you want to use an external diff program only on a
  subset of your files, you might want to use <b>gitattributes</b>(5)
  instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.ignoreSubmodules</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Sets the default value of --ignore-submodules. Note that
  this affects only <i>git diff</i> Porcelain, and not lower level <i>diff</i>
  commands such as <i>git diff-files</i>. <i>git checkout</i> and <i>git
  switch</i> also honor this setting when reporting uncommitted changes. Setting
  it to <i>all</i> disables the submodule summary normally shown by <i>git
  commit</i> and <i>git status</i> when <b>status.submoduleSummary</b> is set
  unless it is overridden by using the --ignore-submodules command-line option.
  The <i>git submodule</i> commands are not affected by this setting. By default
  this is set to untracked so that any untracked submodules are ignored.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.mnemonicPrefix</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set, <i>git diff</i> uses a prefix pair that is
  different from the standard &quot;a/&quot; and &quot;b/&quot; depending on
  what is being compared. When this configuration is in effect, reverse diff
  output also swaps the order of the prefixes:
<p class="Pp"><b>git diff</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">compares the (i)ndex and the (w)ork tree;</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git diff HEAD</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">compares a (c)ommit and the (w)ork tree;</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git diff --cached</b></p>

<p class="Pp"><b>git diff HEAD:file1 file2</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">compares an (o)bject and a (w)ork tree entity;</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>git diff --no-index a b</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">compares two non-git things (1) and (2).</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.noprefix</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set, <i>git diff</i> does not show any source or
  destination prefix.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.relative</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to <i>true</i>, <i>git diff</i> does not show
  changes outside of the directory and show pathnames relative to the current
  directory.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.orderFile</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">File indicating how to order files within a diff. See the
  <i>-O</i> option to <b>git-diff</b>(1) for details. If <b>diff.orderFile</b>
  is a relative pathname, it is treated as relative to the top of the working
  tree.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.renameLimit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The number of files to consider in the exhaustive portion
  of copy/rename detection; equivalent to the <i>git diff</i> option <b>-l</b>.
  If not set, the default value is currently 1000. This setting has no effect if
  rename detection is turned off.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.renames</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether and how Git detects renames. If set to
  &quot;false&quot;, rename detection is disabled. If set to &quot;true&quot;,
  basic rename detection is enabled. If set to &quot;copies&quot; or
  &quot;copy&quot;, Git will detect copies, as well. Defaults to true. Note that
  this affects only <i>git diff</i> Porcelain like <b>git-diff</b>(1) and
  <b>git-log</b>(1), and not lower level commands such as
  <b>git-diff-files</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.suppressBlankEmpty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A boolean to inhibit the standard behavior of printing a
  space before each empty output line. Defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.submodule</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the format in which differences in submodules are
  shown. The &quot;short&quot; format just shows the names of the commits at the
  beginning and end of the range. The &quot;log&quot; format lists the commits
  in the range like <b>git-submodule</b>(1) <b>summary</b> does. The
  &quot;diff&quot; format shows an inline diff of the changed contents of the
  submodule. Defaults to &quot;short&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.wordRegex</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A POSIX Extended Regular Expression used to determine
  what is a &quot;word&quot; when performing word-by-word difference
  calculations. Character sequences that match the regular expression are
  &quot;words&quot;, all other characters are <b>ignorable</b> whitespace.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.&lt;driver&gt;.command</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The custom diff driver command. See
  <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.&lt;driver&gt;.xfuncname</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The regular expression that the diff driver should use to
  recognize the hunk header. A built-in pattern may also be used. See
  <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.&lt;driver&gt;.binary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set this option to true to make the diff driver treat
  files as binary. See <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.&lt;driver&gt;.textconv</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The command that the diff driver should call to generate
  the text-converted version of a file. The result of the conversion is used to
  generate a human-readable diff. See <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.&lt;driver&gt;.wordRegex</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The regular expression that the diff driver should use to
  split words in a line. See <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.&lt;driver&gt;.cachetextconv</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set this option to true to make the diff driver cache the
  text conversion outputs. See <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.tool</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Controls which diff tool is used by
  <b>git-difftool</b>(1). This variable overrides the value configured in
  <b>merge.tool</b>. The list below shows the valid built-in values. Any other
  value is treated as a custom diff tool and requires that a corresponding
  difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd variable is defined.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.guitool</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Controls which diff tool is used by
  <b>git-difftool</b>(1) when the -g/--gui flag is specified. This variable
  overrides the value configured in <b>merge.guitool</b>. The list below shows
  the valid built-in values. Any other value is treated as a custom diff tool

<div class="Bd-indent">Set this option to <b>false</b> to disable the default
  heuristics that shift diff hunk boundaries to make patches easier to
  read.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.algorithm</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:
<p class="Pp"><b>default</b>, <b>myers</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the
  default.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>minimal</b></p>

  is produced.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>patience</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use &quot;patience diff&quot; algorithm when generating
  patches.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>histogram</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to
  &quot;support low-occurrence common elements&quot;.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.wsErrorHighlight</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Highlight whitespace errors in the <b>context</b>,
  <b>old</b> or <b>new</b> lines of the diff. Multiple values are separated by
  comma, <b>none</b> resets previous values, <b>default</b> reset the list to
  <b>new</b> and <b>all</b> is a shorthand for <b>old,new,context</b>. The
  whitespace errors are colored with <b>color.diff.whitespace</b>. The command
  line option <b>--ws-error-highlight=&lt;kind&gt;</b> overrides this
  setting.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.colorMoved</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to either a valid <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b> or a true
  value, moved lines in a diff are colored differently, for details of valid
  modes see <i>--color-moved</i> in <b>git-diff</b>(1). If simply set to true
  the default color mode will be used. When set to false, moved lines are not
  colored.</div>
<p class="Pp">diff.colorMovedWS</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When moved lines are colored using e.g. the
  <b>diff.colorMoved</b> setting, this option controls the <b>&lt;mode&gt;</b>
  how spaces are treated for details of valid modes see <i>--color-moved-ws</i>
  in <b>git-diff</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.path</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Override the path for the given tool. This is useful in
  case your tool is not in the PATH.</div>
<p class="Pp">difftool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the command to invoke the specified diff tool.
  The specified command is evaluated in shell with the following variables
  available: <i>LOCAL</i> is set to the name of the temporary file containing
  the contents of the diff pre-image and <i>REMOTE</i> is set to the name of the
  temporary file containing the contents of the diff post-image.</div>
<p class="Pp">difftool.prompt</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prompt before each invocation of the diff tool.</div>
<p class="Pp">extensions.objectFormat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the hash algorithm to use. The acceptable values
  are <b>sha1</b> and <b>sha256</b>. If not specified, <b>sha1</b> is assumed.
  It is an error to specify this key unless <b>core.repositoryFormatVersion</b>
  is 1.
<p class="Pp">Note that this setting should only be set by <b>git-init</b>(1) or
    <b>git-clone</b>(1). Trying to change it after initialization will not work
    and will produce hard-to-diagnose issues.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">extensions.worktreeConfig</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If enabled, then worktrees will load config settings from
  the <b>$GIT_DIR/config.worktree</b> file in addition to the
  <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config</b> file. Note that <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR</b> and
  <b>$GIT_DIR</b> are the same for the main working tree, while other working
  trees have <b>$GIT_DIR</b> equal to
  <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/worktrees/&lt;id&gt;/</b>. The settings in the
  <b>config.worktree</b> file will override settings from any other config
  files.
<p class="Pp">When enabling <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b>, you must be
    careful to move certain values from the common config file to the main
    working tree&#x2019;s <b>config.worktree</b> file, if present:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>core.worktree</b> must be moved from
  <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config</b> to <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config.worktree</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;If <b>core.bare</b> is true, then it must be
  moved from <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config</b> to
  <b>$GIT_COMMON_DIR/config.worktree</b>.
<p class="Pp">It may also be beneficial to adjust the locations of
    <b>core.sparseCheckout</b> and <b>core.sparseCheckoutCone</b> depending on
    your desire for customizable sparse-checkout settings for each worktree. By
    default, the <b>git sparse-checkout</b> builtin enables
    <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b>, assigns these config values on a
    per-worktree basis, and uses the <b>$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout</b> file
    to specify the sparsity for each worktree independently. See
    <b>git-sparse-checkout</b>(1) for more details.</p>
<p class="Pp">For historical reasons, <b>extensions.worktreeConfig</b> is
    respected regardless of the <b>core.repositoryFormatVersion</b> setting.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">fastimport.unpackLimit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If the number of objects imported by
  <b>git-fast-import</b>(1) is below this limit, then the objects will be
  unpacked into loose object files. However if the number of imported objects
  equals or exceeds this limit then the pack will be stored as a pack. Storing
  the pack from a fast-import can make the import operation complete faster,
  especially on slow filesystems. If not set, the value of
  <b>transfer.unpackLimit</b> is used instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">feature.*</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The config settings that start with <b>feature.</b>
  modify the defaults of a group of other config settings. These groups are
  created by the Git developer community as recommended defaults and are subject
  to change. In particular, new config options may be added with different
  defaults.</div>
<p class="Pp">feature.experimental</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable config options that are new to Git, and are being
  considered for future defaults. Config settings included here may be added or
  removed with each release, including minor version updates. These settings may
  have unintended interactions since they are so new. Please enable this setting
  if you are interested in providing feedback on experimental features. The new
  default values are:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>fetch.negotiationAlgorithm=skipping</b> may
  improve fetch negotiation times by skipping more commits at a time, reducing
  the number of round trips.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">feature.manyFiles</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable config options that optimize for repos with many
  files in the working directory. With many files, commands such as <b>git
  status</b> and <b>git checkout</b> may be slow and these new defaults improve
  performance:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>index.version=4</b> enables path-prefix
  compression in the index.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>core.untrackedCache=true</b> enables the
  untracked cache. This setting assumes that mtime is working on your
  machine.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">fetch.recurseSubmodules</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option controls whether <b>git fetch</b> (and the
  underlying fetch in <b>git pull</b>) will recursively fetch into populated
  submodules. This option can be set either to a boolean value or to
  <i>on-demand</i>. Setting it to a boolean changes the behavior of fetch and
  pull to recurse unconditionally into submodules when set to true or to not
  recurse at all when set to false. When set to <i>on-demand</i>, fetch and pull
  will only recurse into a populated submodule when its superproject retrieves a
  commit that updates the submodule&#x2019;s reference. Defaults to
  <i>on-demand</i>, or to the value of <i>submodule.recurse</i> if set.</div>
<p class="Pp">fetch.fsckObjects</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If it is set to true, git-fetch-pack will check all
  fetched objects. See <b>transfer.fsckObjects</b> for what&#x2019;s checked.
  Defaults to false. If not set, the value of <b>transfer.fsckObjects</b> is
  used instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Acts like <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b>, but is used by
  <b>git-fetch-pack</b>(1) instead of <b>git-fsck</b>(1). See the
  <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> documentation for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">fetch.fsck.skipList</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Acts like <b>fsck.skipList</b>, but is used by
  <b>git-fetch-pack</b>(1) instead of <b>git-fsck</b>(1). See the
  <b>fsck.skipList</b> documentation for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">fetch.unpackLimit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If the number of objects fetched over the Git native
  transfer is below this limit, then the objects will be unpacked into loose
  object files. However if the number of received objects equals or exceeds this
  limit then the received pack will be stored as a pack, after adding any
  missing delta bases. Storing the pack from a push can make the push operation
  complete faster, especially on slow filesystems. If not set, the value of
  <b>transfer.unpackLimit</b> is used instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">fetch.prune</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, fetch will automatically behave as if the
  <b>--prune</b> option was given on the command line. See also
  <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.prune</b> and the PRUNING section of
  <b>git-fetch</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">fetch.pruneTags</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, fetch will automatically behave as if the
  <b>refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*</b> refspec was provided when pruning, if not set
  already. This allows for setting both this option and <b>fetch.prune</b> to
  maintain a 1=1 mapping to upstream refs. See also
  <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.pruneTags</b> and the PRUNING section of
  <b>git-fetch</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">fetch.output</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Control how ref update status is printed. Valid values
  are <b>full</b> and <b>compact</b>. Default value is <b>full</b>. See section
  OUTPUT in <b>git-fetch</b>(1) for detail.</div>
<p class="Pp">fetch.negotiationAlgorithm</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Control how information about the commits in the local
  repository is sent when negotiating the contents of the packfile to be sent by
  the server. Set to &quot;consecutive&quot; to use an algorithm that walks over
  consecutive commits checking each one. Set to &quot;skipping&quot; to use an
  algorithm that skips commits in an effort to converge faster, but may result
  in a larger-than-necessary packfile; or set to &quot;noop&quot; to not send
  any information at all, which will almost certainly result in a
  larger-than-necessary packfile, but will skip the negotiation step. Set to
  &quot;default&quot; to override settings made previously and use the default
  behaviour. The default is normally &quot;consecutive&quot;, but if
  <b>feature.experimental</b> is true, then the default is &quot;skipping&quot;.
  Unknown values will cause <i>git fetch</i> to error out.
<p class="Pp">See also the <b>--negotiate-only</b> and <b>--negotiation-tip</b>
    options to <b>git-fetch</b>(1).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">fetch.showForcedUpdates</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set to false to enable <b>--no-show-forced-updates</b> in
  <b>git-fetch</b>(1) and <b>git-pull</b>(1) commands. Defaults to true.</div>
<p class="Pp">fetch.parallel</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the maximal number of fetch operations to be
  run in parallel at a time (submodules, or remotes when the <b>--multiple</b>
  option of <b>git-fetch</b>(1) is in effect).
<p class="Pp">A value of 0 will give some reasonable default. If unset, it
    defaults to 1.</p>
<p class="Pp">For submodules, this setting can be overridden using the
    <b>submodule.fetchJobs</b> config setting.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">fetch.writeCommitGraph</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set to true to write a commit-graph after every <b>git
  fetch</b> command that downloads a pack-file from a remote. Using the
  <b>--split</b> option, most executions will create a very small commit-graph
  file on top of the existing commit-graph file(s). Occasionally, these files
  will merge and the write may take longer. Having an updated commit-graph file
  helps performance of many Git commands, including <b>git merge-base</b>,
  <b>git push -f</b>, and <b>git log --graph</b>. Defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">format.attach</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable multipart/mixed attachments as the default for
  <i>format-patch</i>. The value can also be a double quoted string which will
  enable attachments as the default and set the value as the boundary. See the
  --attach option in <b>git-format-patch</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">format.from</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Provides the default value for the <b>--from</b> option
  to format-patch. Accepts a boolean value, or a name and email address. If
  false, format-patch defaults to <b>--no-from</b>, using commit authors
  directly in the &quot;From:&quot; field of patch mails. If true, format-patch
  defaults to <b>--from</b>, using your committer identity in the
  &quot;From:&quot; field of patch mails and including a &quot;From:&quot; field
  in the body of the patch mail if different. If set to a non-boolean value,
  format-patch uses that value instead of your committer identity. Defaults to
  false.</div>
<p class="Pp">format.numbered</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A boolean which can enable or disable sequence numbers in
  patch subjects. It defaults to &quot;auto&quot; which enables it only if there
  is more than one patch. It can be enabled or disabled for all messages by
  setting it to &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. See --numbered option in
  <b>git-format-patch</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">format.headers</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Additional email headers to include in a patch to be
  submitted by mail. See <b>git-format-patch</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">format.to, format.cc</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Additional recipients to include in a patch to be
  submitted by mail. See the --to and --cc options in
  <b>git-format-patch</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">format.subjectPrefix</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default for format-patch is to output files with the
  <i>[PATCH]</i> subject prefix. Use this variable to change that prefix.</div>
<p class="Pp">format.coverFromDescription</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default mode for format-patch to determine which
  parts of the cover letter will be populated using the branch&#x2019;s
  description. See the <b>--cover-from-description</b> option in
  <b>git-format-patch</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">format.signature</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default for format-patch is to output a signature
  containing the Git version number. Use this variable to change that default.
  Set this variable to the empty string (&quot;&quot;) to suppress signature
  generation.</div>
<p class="Pp">format.signatureFile</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Works just like format.signature except the contents of
  the file specified by this variable will be used as the signature.</div>
<p class="Pp">format.suffix</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default for format-patch is to output files with the
  suffix <b>.patch</b>. Use this variable to change that suffix (make sure to
  include the dot if you want it).</div>
<p class="Pp">format.encodeEmailHeaders</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Encode email headers that have non-ASCII characters with
  &quot;Q-encoding&quot; (described in RFC 2047) for email transmission.
  Defaults to true.</div>
<p class="Pp">format.pretty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default pretty format for log/show/whatchanged
  command, See <b>git-log</b>(1), <b>git-show</b>(1),
  <b>git-whatchanged</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">format.thread</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default threading style for <i>git format-patch</i>.
  Can be a boolean value, or <b>shallow</b> or <b>deep</b>. <b>shallow</b>
  threading makes every mail a reply to the head of the series, where the head
  is chosen from the cover letter, the <b>--in-reply-to</b>, and the first patch
  mail, in this order. <b>deep</b> threading makes every mail a reply to the
  previous one. A true boolean value is the same as <b>shallow</b>, and a false
  value disables threading.</div>
<p class="Pp">format.signOff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A boolean value which lets you enable the
  <b>-s/--signoff</b> option of format-patch by default. <b>Note:</b> Adding the
  <b>Signed-off-by</b> trailer to a patch should be a conscious act and means
  that you certify you have the rights to submit this work under the same open
  source license. Please see the <i>SubmittingPatches</i> document for further
  discussion.</div>
<p class="Pp">format.coverLetter</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A boolean that controls whether to generate a
  cover-letter when format-patch is invoked, but in addition can be set to
  &quot;auto&quot;, to generate a cover-letter only when there&#x2019;s more
  than one patch. Default is false.</div>
<p class="Pp">format.outputDirectory</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set a custom directory to store the resulting files
  instead of the current working directory. All directory components will be
  created.</div>
<p class="Pp">format.filenameMaxLength</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The maximum length of the output filenames generated by
  the <b>format-patch</b> command; defaults to 64. Can be overridden by the
  <b>--filename-max-length=&lt;n&gt;</b> command line option.</div>
<p class="Pp">format.useAutoBase</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A boolean value which lets you enable the
  <b>--base=auto</b> option of format-patch by default. Can also be set to
  &quot;whenAble&quot; to allow enabling <b>--base=auto</b> if a suitable base
  is available, but to skip adding base info otherwise without the format
  dying.</div>
<p class="Pp">format.notes</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Provides the default value for the <b>--notes</b> option
  to format-patch. Accepts a boolean value, or a ref which specifies where to
  get notes. If false, format-patch defaults to <b>--no-notes</b>. If true,
  format-patch defaults to <b>--notes</b>. If set to a non-boolean value,
  format-patch defaults to <b>--notes=&lt;ref&gt;</b>, where <b>ref</b> is the
  non-boolean value. Defaults to false.
<p class="Pp">If one wishes to use the ref <b>ref/notes/true</b>, please use
    that literal instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">This configuration can be specified multiple times in order to
    allow multiple notes refs to be included. In that case, it will behave
    similarly to multiple <b>--[no-]notes[=]</b> options passed in. That is, a
    value of <b>true</b> will show the default notes, a value of
    <b>&lt;ref&gt;</b> will also show notes from that notes ref and a value of
    <b>false</b> will negate previous configurations and not show notes.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
[format]
        notes = true
        notes = foo
        notes = false
        notes = bar
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">will only show notes from <b>refs/notes/bar</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">filter.&lt;driver&gt;.clean</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The command which is used to convert the content of a
  worktree file to a blob upon checkin. See <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for
  details.</div>
<p class="Pp">filter.&lt;driver&gt;.smudge</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The command which is used to convert the content of a
  blob object to a worktree file upon checkout. See <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for
  details.</div>
<p class="Pp">fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">During fsck git may find issues with legacy data which
  wouldn&#x2019;t be generated by current versions of git, and which
  wouldn&#x2019;t be sent over the wire if <b>transfer.fsckObjects</b> was set.
  This feature is intended to support working with legacy repositories
  containing such data.
<p class="Pp">Setting <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> will be picked up by
    <b>git-fsck</b>(1), but to accept pushes of such data set
    <b>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> instead, or to clone or fetch it set
    <b>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The rest of the documentation discusses <b>fsck.*</b> for brevity,
    but the same applies for the corresponding <b>receive.fsck.*</b> and
    <b>fetch.&lt;msg-id&gt;.*</b>. variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike variables like <b>color.ui</b> and <b>core.editor</b> the
    <b>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> and <b>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b>
    variables will not fall back on the <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> configuration
    if they aren&#x2019;t set. To uniformly configure the same fsck settings in
    different circumstances all three of them they must all set to the same
    values.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> is set, errors can be switched to
    warnings and vice versa by configuring the <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b>
    setting where the <b>&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> is the fsck message ID and the value
    is one of <b>error</b>, <b>warn</b> or <b>ignore</b>. For convenience, fsck
    prefixes the error/warning with the message ID, e.g. &quot;missingEmail:
    invalid author/committer line - missing email&quot; means that setting
    <b>fsck.missingEmail = ignore</b> will hide that issue.</p>
<p class="Pp">In general, it is better to enumerate existing objects with
    problems with <b>fsck.skipList</b>, instead of listing the kind of breakages
    these problematic objects share to be ignored, as doing the latter will
    allow new instances of the same breakages go unnoticed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Setting an unknown <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> value will cause
    fsck to die, but doing the same for <b>receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> and
    <b>fetch.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> will only cause git to warn.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">fsck.skipList</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The path to a list of object names (i.e. one
  unabbreviated SHA-1 per line) that are known to be broken in a non-fatal way
  and should be ignored. On versions of Git 2.20 and later comments (<i>#</i>),
  empty lines, and any leading and trailing whitespace is ignored. Everything
  but a SHA-1 per line will error out on older versions.
<p class="Pp">This feature is useful when an established project should be
    accepted despite early commits containing errors that can be safely ignored
    such as invalid committer email addresses. Note: corrupt objects cannot be
    skipped with this setting.</p>
<p class="Pp">Like <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> this variable has corresponding
    <b>receive.fsck.skipList</b> and <b>fetch.fsck.skipList</b> variants.</p>
<p class="Pp">Unlike variables like <b>color.ui</b> and <b>core.editor</b> the
    <b>receive.fsck.skipList</b> and <b>fetch.fsck.skipList</b> variables will
    not fall back on the <b>fsck.skipList</b> configuration if they
    aren&#x2019;t set. To uniformly configure the same fsck settings in
    different circumstances all three of them they must all set to the same
    values.</p>
<p class="Pp">Older versions of Git (before 2.20) documented that the object
    names list should be sorted. This was never a requirement, the object names
    could appear in any order, but when reading the list we tracked whether the
    list was sorted for the purposes of an internal binary search
    implementation, which could save itself some work with an already sorted
    list. Unless you had a humongous list there was no reason to go out of your
    way to pre-sort the list. After Git version 2.20 a hash implementation is
    used instead, so there&#x2019;s now no reason to pre-sort the list.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.aggressiveDepth</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The depth parameter used in the delta compression
  algorithm used by <i>git gc --aggressive</i>. This defaults to 50, which is
  the default for the <b>--depth</b> option when <b>--aggressive</b>
  isn&#x2019;t in use.
<p class="Pp">See the documentation for the <b>--depth</b> option in
    <b>git-repack</b>(1) for more details.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.aggressiveWindow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The window size parameter used in the delta compression
  algorithm used by <i>git gc --aggressive</i>. This defaults to 250, which is a
  much more aggressive window size than the default <b>--window</b> of 10.
<p class="Pp">See the documentation for the <b>--window</b> option in
    <b>git-repack</b>(1) for more details.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When there are approximately more than this many loose
  objects in the repository, <b>git gc --auto</b> will pack them. Some Porcelain
  commands use this command to perform a light-weight garbage collection from
  time to time. The default value is 6700.
<p class="Pp">Setting this to 0 disables not only automatic packing based on the
    number of loose objects, but any other heuristic <b>git gc --auto</b> will
    otherwise use to determine if there&#x2019;s work to do, such as
    <b>gc.autoPackLimit</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.autoPackLimit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When there are more than this many packs that are not
  marked with <b>*.keep</b> file in the repository, <b>git gc --auto</b>
  consolidates them into one larger pack. The default value is 50. Setting this
  to 0 disables it. Setting <b>gc.auto</b> to 0 will also disable this.
<p class="Pp">See the <b>gc.bigPackThreshold</b> configuration variable below.
    When in use, it&#x2019;ll affect how the auto pack limit works.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.autoDetach</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Make <b>git gc --auto</b> return immediately and run in
  background if the system supports it. Default is true.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.bigPackThreshold</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If non-zero, all packs larger than this limit are kept
  when <b>git gc</b> is run. This is very similar to <b>--keep-largest-pack</b>
  except that all packs that meet the threshold are kept, not just the largest
  pack. Defaults to zero. Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or
  <i>g</i> are supported.
<p class="Pp">Note that if the number of kept packs is more than
    gc.autoPackLimit, this configuration variable is ignored, all packs except
    the base pack will be repacked. After this the number of packs should go
    below gc.autoPackLimit and gc.bigPackThreshold should be respected
  again.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the amount of memory estimated for <b>git repack</b> to run
    smoothly is not available and <b>gc.bigPackThreshold</b> is not set, the
    largest pack will also be excluded (this is the equivalent of running <b>git
    gc</b> with <b>--keep-largest-pack</b>).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.writeCommitGraph</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, then gc will rewrite the commit-graph file when
  <b>git-gc</b>(1) is run. When using <b>git gc --auto</b> the commit-graph will
  be updated if housekeeping is required. Default is true. See
  <b>git-commit-graph</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.logExpiry</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If the file gc.log exists, then <b>git gc --auto</b> will
  print its content and exit with status zero instead of running unless that
  file is more than <i>gc.logExpiry</i> old. Default is &quot;1.day&quot;. See
  <b>gc.pruneExpire</b> for more ways to specify its value.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.packRefs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Running <b>git pack-refs</b> in a repository renders it
  unclonable by Git versions prior to 1.5.1.2 over dumb transports such as HTTP.
  This variable determines whether <i>git gc</i> runs <b>git pack-refs</b>. This
  can be set to <b>notbare</b> to enable it within all non-bare repos or it can
  be set to a boolean value. The default is <b>true</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.cruftPacks</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Store unreachable objects in a cruft pack (see
  <b>git-repack</b>(1)) instead of as loose objects. The default is
  <b>false</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.pruneExpire</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <i>git gc</i> is run, it will call <i>prune --expire
  2.weeks.ago</i> (and <i>repack --cruft --cruft-expiration 2.weeks.ago</i> if
  using cruft packs via <b>gc.cruftPacks</b> or <b>--cruft</b>). Override the
  grace period with this config variable. The value &quot;now&quot; may be used
  to disable this grace period and always prune unreachable objects immediately,
  or &quot;never&quot; may be used to suppress pruning. This feature helps
  prevent corruption when <i>git gc</i> runs concurrently with another process
  writing to the repository; see the &quot;NOTES&quot; section of
  <b>git-gc</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.worktreePruneExpire</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <i>git gc</i> is run, it calls <i>git worktree prune
  --expire 3.months.ago</i>. This config variable can be used to set a different
  grace period. The value &quot;now&quot; may be used to disable the grace
  period and prune <b>$GIT_DIR/worktrees</b> immediately, or &quot;never&quot;
  may be used to suppress pruning.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.reflogExpire, gc.&lt;pattern&gt;.reflogExpire</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><i>git reflog expire</i> removes reflog entries older
  than this time; defaults to 90 days. The value &quot;now&quot; expires all
  entries immediately, and &quot;never&quot; suppresses expiration altogether.
  With &quot;&lt;pattern&gt;&quot; (e.g. &quot;refs/stash&quot;) in the middle
  the setting applies only to the refs that match the &lt;pattern&gt;.</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.reflogExpireUnreachable,
    gc.&lt;pattern&gt;.reflogExpireUnreachable</p>
<div class="Bd-indent"><i>git reflog expire</i> removes reflog entries older
  than this time and are not reachable from the current tip; defaults to 30
  days. The value &quot;now&quot; expires all entries immediately, and
  &quot;never&quot; suppresses expiration altogether. With
  &quot;&lt;pattern&gt;&quot; (e.g. &quot;refs/stash&quot;) in the middle, the
  setting applies only to the refs that match the &lt;pattern&gt;.
<p class="Pp">These types of entries are generally created as a result of using
    <b>git commit --amend</b> or <b>git rebase</b> and are the commits prior to
    the amend or rebase occurring. Since these changes are not part of the
    current project most users will want to expire them sooner, which is why the
    default is more aggressive than <b>gc.reflogExpire</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.rerereResolved</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Records of conflicted merge you resolved earlier are kept
  for this many days when <i>git rerere gc</i> is run. You can also use more
  human-readable &quot;1.month.ago&quot;, etc. The default is 60 days. See
  <b>git-rerere</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">gc.rerereUnresolved</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Records of conflicted merge you have not resolved are
  kept for this many days when <i>git rerere gc</i> is run. You can also use
  more human-readable &quot;1.month.ago&quot;, etc. The default is 15 days. See
  <b>git-rerere</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">gitcvs.commitMsgAnnotation</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Append this string to each commit message. Set to empty
  string to disable this feature. Defaults to &quot;via git-CVS
  emulator&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">gitcvs.enabled</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether the CVS server interface is enabled for this
  repository. See <b>git-cvsserver</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">gitcvs.logFile</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Path to a log file where the CVS server interface well...
  logs various stuff. See <b>git-cvsserver</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">gitcvs.usecrlfattr</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, the server will look up the end-of-line
  conversion attributes for files to determine the <b>-k</b> modes to use. If
  the attributes force Git to treat a file as text, the <b>-k</b> mode will be
  left blank so CVS clients will treat it as text. If they suppress text
  conversion, the file will be set with <i>-kb</i> mode, which suppresses any
  newline munging the client might otherwise do. If the attributes do not allow
  the file type to be determined, then <b>gitcvs.allBinary</b> is used. See
  <b>gitattributes</b>(5).</div>
<p class="Pp">gitcvs.allBinary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is used if <b>gitcvs.usecrlfattr</b> does not
  resolve the correct <i>-kb</i> mode to use. If true, all unresolved files are
  sent to the client in mode <i>-kb</i>. This causes the client to treat them as
  binary files, which suppresses any newline munging it otherwise might do.
  Alternatively, if it is set to &quot;guess&quot;, then the contents of the
  file are examined to decide if it is binary, similar to
  <b>core.autocrlf</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">gitcvs.dbName</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Database used by git-cvsserver to cache revision
  information derived from the Git repository. The exact meaning depends on the
  used database driver, for SQLite (which is the default driver) this is a
  filename. Supports variable substitution (see <b>git-cvsserver</b>(1) for
  details). May not contain semicolons (<b>;</b>). Default:
  <i>%Ggitcvs.%m.sqlite</i></div>
<p class="Pp">gitcvs.dbDriver</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Used Perl DBI driver. You can specify any available
  driver for this here, but it might not work. git-cvsserver is tested with
  <i>DBD::SQLite</i>, reported to work with <i>DBD::Pg</i>, and reported
  <b>not</b> to work with <i>DBD::mysql</i>. Experimental feature. May not
  contain double colons (<b>:</b>). Default: <i>SQLite</i>. See
  <b>git-cvsserver</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">gitcvs.dbUser, gitcvs.dbPass</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Database user and password. Only useful if setting
  <b>gitcvs.dbDriver</b>, since SQLite has no concept of database users and/or
  passwords. <i>gitcvs.dbUser</i> supports variable substitution (see
  <b>git-cvsserver</b>(1) for details).</div>
<p class="Pp">gitcvs.dbTableNamePrefix</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Database table name prefix. Prepended to the names of any
  database tables used, allowing a single database to be used for several
  repositories. Supports variable substitution (see <b>git-cvsserver</b>(1) for
  details). Any non-alphabetic characters will be replaced with
  underscores.</div>
<p class="Pp">All gitcvs variables except for <b>gitcvs.usecrlfattr</b> and
    <b>gitcvs.allBinary</b> can also be specified as
    <i>gitcvs.&lt;access_method&gt;.&lt;varname&gt;</i> (where
    <i>access_method</i> is one of &quot;ext&quot; and &quot;pserver&quot;) to
    make them apply only for the given access method.</p>
<p class="Pp">gitweb.category, gitweb.description, gitweb.owner, gitweb.url</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">See <b>gitweb</b>(1) for description.</div>
<p class="Pp">gitweb.avatar, gitweb.blame, gitweb.grep, gitweb.highlight,
    gitweb.patches, gitweb.pickaxe, gitweb.remote_heads, gitweb.showSizes,
    gitweb.snapshot</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">See <b>gitweb.conf</b>(5) for description.</div>
<p class="Pp">grep.lineNumber</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, enable <b>-n</b> option by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">grep.column</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, enable the <b>--column</b> option by
  default.</div>
<p class="Pp">grep.patternType</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the default matching behavior. Using a value of
  <i>basic</i>, <i>extended</i>, <i>fixed</i>, or <i>perl</i> will enable the
  <b>--basic-regexp</b>, <b>--extended-regexp</b>, <b>--fixed-strings</b>, or
  <b>--perl-regexp</b> option accordingly, while the value <i>default</i> will
  use the <b>grep.extendedRegexp</b> option to choose between <i>basic</i> and
  <i>extended</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">grep.extendedRegexp</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, enable <b>--extended-regexp</b> option by
  default. This option is ignored when the <b>grep.patternType</b> option is set
  to a value other than <i>default</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">grep.threads</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Number of grep worker threads to use. See
  <b>grep.threads</b> in <b>git-grep</b>(1) for more information.</div>
<p class="Pp">grep.fallbackToNoIndex</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, fall back to git grep --no-index if git
  grep is executed outside of a git repository. Defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">gpg.program</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use this custom program instead of &quot;<b>gpg</b>&quot;
  found on <b>$PATH</b> when making or verifying a PGP signature. The program
  must support the same command-line interface as GPG, namely, to verify a
  detached signature, &quot;<b>gpg --verify $signature - &lt;$file</b>&quot; is
  run, and the program is expected to signal a good signature by exiting with
  code 0, and to generate an ASCII-armored detached signature, the standard
  input of &quot;<b>gpg -bsau $key</b>&quot; is fed with the contents to be
  signed, and the program is expected to send the result to its standard
  output.</div>
<p class="Pp">gpg.format</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies which key format to use when signing with
  <b>--gpg-sign</b>. Default is &quot;openpgp&quot;. Other possible values are
  &quot;x509&quot;, &quot;ssh&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">gpg.&lt;format&gt;.program</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use this to customize the program used for the signing
  format you chose. (see <b>gpg.program</b> and <b>gpg.format</b>)
  <b>gpg.program</b> can still be used as a legacy synonym for
  <b>gpg.openpgp.program</b>. The default value for <b>gpg.x509.program</b> is
  &quot;gpgsm&quot; and <b>gpg.ssh.program</b> is &quot;ssh-keygen&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">gpg.minTrustLevel</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies a minimum trust level for signature
  verification. If this option is unset, then signature verification for merge
  operations require a key with at least <b>marginal</b> trust. Other operations
  that perform signature verification require a key with at least
  <b>undefined</b> trust. Setting this option overrides the required trust-level
  for all operations. Supported values, in increasing order of significance:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>undefined</b></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>never</b></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>marginal</b></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>fully</b></div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>ultimate</b></div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gpg.ssh.defaultKeyCommand</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This command that will be run when user.signingkey is not
  set and a ssh signature is requested. On successful exit a valid ssh public
  key prefixed with <b>key::</b> is expected in the first line of its output.
  This allows for a script doing a dynamic lookup of the correct public key when
  it is impractical to statically configure <b>user.signingKey</b>. For example
  when keys or SSH Certificates are rotated frequently or selection of the right
  key depends on external factors unknown to git.</div>
<p class="Pp">gpg.ssh.allowedSignersFile</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A file containing ssh public keys which you are willing
  to trust. The file consists of one or more lines of principals followed by an
  ssh public key. e.g.: <b>user1@example.com,user2@example.com ssh-rsa
  AAAAX1...</b> See ssh-keygen(1) &quot;ALLOWED SIGNERS&quot; for details. The
  principal is only used to identify the key and is available when verifying a
  signature.
<p class="Pp">SSH has no concept of trust levels like gpg does. To be able to
    differentiate between valid signatures and trusted signatures the trust
    level of a signature verification is set to <b>fully</b> when the public key
    is present in the allowedSignersFile. Otherwise the trust level is
    <b>undefined</b> and git verify-commit/tag will fail.</p>
<p class="Pp">This file can be set to a location outside of the repository and
    every developer maintains their own trust store. A central repository server
    could generate this file automatically from ssh keys with push access to
    verify the code against. In a corporate setting this file is probably
    generated at a global location from automation that already handles
    developer ssh keys.</p>
<p class="Pp">A repository that only allows signed commits can store the file in
    the repository itself using a path relative to the top-level of the working
    tree. This way only committers with an already valid key can add or change
    keys in the keyring.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since OpensSSH 8.8 this file allows specifying a key lifetime
    using valid-after &amp; valid-before options. Git will mark signatures as
    valid if the signing key was valid at the time of the signature&#x2019;s
    creation. This allows users to change a signing key without invalidating all
    previously made signatures.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using a SSH CA key with the cert-authority option (see
    ssh-keygen(1) &quot;CERTIFICATES&quot;) is also valid.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">gpg.ssh.revocationFile</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Either a SSH KRL or a list of revoked public keys
  (without the principal prefix). See ssh-keygen(1) for details. If a public key
  is found in this file then it will always be treated as having trust level
  &quot;never&quot; and signatures will show as invalid.</div>
<p class="Pp">gui.commitMsgWidth</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Defines how wide the commit message window is in the
  <b>git-gui</b>(1). &quot;75&quot; is the default.</div>
<p class="Pp">gui.diffContext</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies how many context lines should be used in calls
  to diff made by the <b>git-gui</b>(1). The default is &quot;5&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">gui.displayUntracked</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Determines if <b>git-gui</b>(1) shows untracked files in
  the file list. The default is &quot;true&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">gui.encoding</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the default character encoding to use for
  displaying of file contents in <b>git-gui</b>(1) and <b>gitk</b>(1). It can be
  overridden by setting the <i>encoding</i> attribute for relevant files (see
  <b>gitattributes</b>(5)). If this option is not set, the tools default to the
  locale encoding.</div>
<p class="Pp">gui.matchTrackingBranch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Determines if new branches created with <b>git-gui</b>(1)
  should default to tracking remote branches with matching names or not.
  Default: &quot;false&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">gui.newBranchTemplate</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Is used as suggested name when creating new branches
  using the <b>git-gui</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">gui.pruneDuringFetch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&quot;true&quot; if <b>git-gui</b>(1) should prune
  remote-tracking branches when performing a fetch. The default value is
  &quot;false&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">gui.trustmtime</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Determines if <b>git-gui</b>(1) should trust the file
  modification timestamp or not. By default the timestamps are not
  trusted.</div>
<p class="Pp">gui.spellingDictionary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the dictionary used for spell checking commit
  messages in the <b>git-gui</b>(1). When set to &quot;none&quot; spell checking
  is turned off.</div>
<p class="Pp">gui.fastCopyBlame</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, <i>git gui blame</i> uses <b>-C</b> instead of
  <b>-C -C</b> for original location detection. It makes blame significantly
  faster on huge repositories at the expense of less thorough copy
  detection.</div>
<p class="Pp">gui.copyBlameThreshold</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the threshold to use in <i>git gui blame</i>
  original location detection, measured in alphanumeric characters. See the
  <b>git-blame</b>(1) manual for more information on copy detection.</div>
<p class="Pp">gui.blamehistoryctx</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the radius of history context in days to show
  in <b>gitk</b>(1) for the selected commit, when the <b>Show History

<p class="Pp">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.cmd</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the shell command line to execute when the
  corresponding item of the <b>git-gui</b>(1) <b>Tools</b> menu is invoked. This
  option is mandatory for every tool. The command is executed from the root of
  the working directory, and in the environment it receives the name of the tool
  as <b>GIT_GUITOOL</b>, the name of the currently selected file as
  <i>FILENAME</i>, and the name of the current branch as <i>CUR_BRANCH</i> (if
  the head is detached, <i>CUR_BRANCH</i> is empty).</div>
<p class="Pp">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.needsFile</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Run the tool only if a diff is selected in the GUI. It
  guarantees that <i>FILENAME</i> is not empty.</div>
<p class="Pp">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.noConsole</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Run the command silently, without creating a window to
  display its output.</div>
<p class="Pp">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.noRescan</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Don&#x2019;t rescan the working directory for changes
  after the tool finishes execution.</div>
<p class="Pp">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.confirm</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show a confirmation dialog before actually running the
  tool.</div>
<p class="Pp">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.argPrompt</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Request a string argument from the user, and pass it to
  the tool through the <b>ARGS</b> environment variable. Since requesting an
  argument implies confirmation, the <i>confirm</i> option has no effect if this
  is enabled. If the option is set to <i>true</i>, <i>yes</i>, or <i>1</i>, the
  dialog uses a built-in generic prompt; otherwise the exact value of the
  variable is used.</div>
<p class="Pp">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.revPrompt</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Request a single valid revision from the user, and set
  the <b>REVISION</b> environment variable. In other aspects this option is
  similar to <i>argPrompt</i>, and can be used together with it.</div>
<p class="Pp">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.revUnmerged</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show only unmerged branches in the <i>revPrompt</i>
  subdialog. This is useful for tools similar to merge or rebase, but not for
  things like checkout or reset.</div>
<p class="Pp">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.title</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the title to use for the prompt dialog. The
  default is the tool name.</div>
<p class="Pp">guitool.&lt;name&gt;.prompt</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the general prompt string to display at the top
  of the dialog, before subsections for <i>argPrompt</i> and <i>revPrompt</i>.
  The default value includes the actual command.</div>

<div class="Bd-indent">Override the default help format used by
  <b>git-help</b>(1). Values <i>man</i>, <i>info</i>, <i>web</i> and <i>html</i>
  are supported. <i>man</i> is the default. <i>web</i> and <i>html</i> are the
  same.</div>
<p class="Pp">help.autoCorrect</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If git detects typos and can identify exactly one valid
  command similar to the error, git will try to suggest the correct command or
  even run the suggestion automatically. Possible config values are:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;0 (default): show the suggested command.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;positive number: run the suggested command after
  specified deciseconds (0.1 sec).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>

  immediately.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&quot;prompt&quot;: show the suggestion and
  prompt for confirmation to run the command.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;&quot;never&quot;: don&#x2019;t run or show any
  suggested command.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">help.htmlPath</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the path where the HTML documentation resides.
  File system paths and URLs are supported. HTML pages will be prefixed with
  this path when help is displayed in the <i>web</i> format. This defaults to
  the documentation path of your Git installation.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.proxy</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Override the HTTP proxy, normally configured using the
  <i>http_proxy</i>, <i>https_proxy</i>, and <i>all_proxy</i> environment
  variables (see <b>curl(1)</b>). In addition to the syntax understood by curl,
  it is possible to specify a proxy string with a user name but no password, in
  which case git will attempt to acquire one in the same way it does for other
  credentials. See <b>gitcredentials</b>(7) for more information. The syntax
  thus is <i>[protocol://][user[:password]@]proxyhost[:port]</i>. This can be
  overridden on a per-remote basis; see remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxy</div>
<p class="Pp">http.proxyAuthMethod</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the method with which to authenticate against the
  HTTP proxy. This only takes effect if the configured proxy string contains a
  user name part (i.e. is of the form <i>user@host</i> or
  <i>user@host:port</i>). This can be overridden on a per-remote basis; see
  <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxyAuthMethod</b>. Both can be overridden by the
  <b>GIT_HTTP_PROXY_AUTHMETHOD</b> environment variable. Possible values are:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>anyauth</b> - Automatically pick a suitable
  authentication method. It is assumed that the proxy answers an unauthenticated
  request with a 407 status code and one or more Proxy-authenticate headers with
  supported authentication methods. This is the default.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>basic</b> - HTTP Basic authentication</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>digest</b> - HTTP Digest authentication; this
  prevents the password from being transmitted to the proxy in clear text</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>negotiate</b> - GSS-Negotiate authentication
  (compare the --negotiate option of <b>curl(1)</b>)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>ntlm</b> - NTLM authentication (compare the
  --ntlm option of <b>curl(1)</b>)</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">http.proxySSLCert</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The pathname of a file that stores a client certificate
  to use to authenticate with an HTTPS proxy. Can be overridden by the
  <b>GIT_PROXY_SSL_CERT</b> environment variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.proxySSLKey</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The pathname of a file that stores a private key to use
  to authenticate with an HTTPS proxy. Can be overridden by the
  <b>GIT_PROXY_SSL_KEY</b> environment variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.proxySSLCertPasswordProtected</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable Git&#x2019;s password prompt for the proxy SSL
  certificate. Otherwise OpenSSL will prompt the user, possibly many times, if
  the certificate or private key is encrypted. Can be overridden by the
  <b>GIT_PROXY_SSL_CERT_PASSWORD_PROTECTED</b> environment variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.proxySSLCAInfo</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pathname to the file containing the certificate bundle
  that should be used to verify the proxy with when using an HTTPS proxy. Can be
  overridden by the <b>GIT_PROXY_SSL_CAINFO</b> environment variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.emptyAuth</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Attempt authentication without seeking a username or
  password. This can be used to attempt GSS-Negotiate authentication without
  specifying a username in the URL, as libcurl normally requires a username for
  authentication.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.delegation</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Control GSSAPI credential delegation. The delegation is
  disabled by default in libcurl since version 7.21.7. Set parameter to tell the
  server what it is allowed to delegate when it comes to user credentials. Used
  with GSS/kerberos. Possible values are:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>none</b> - Don&#x2019;t allow any
  delegation.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>policy</b> - Delegates if and only if the
  OK-AS-DELEGATE flag is set in the Kerberos service ticket, which is a matter
  of realm policy.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>always</b> - Unconditionally allow the server
  to delegate.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">http.extraHeader</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pass an additional HTTP header when communicating with a
  server. If more than one such entry exists, all of them are added as extra
  headers. To allow overriding the settings inherited from the system config, an
  empty value will reset the extra headers to the empty list.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.cookieFile</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The pathname of a file containing previously stored
  cookie lines, which should be used in the Git http session, if they match the
  server. The file format of the file to read cookies from should be plain HTTP
  headers or the Netscape/Mozilla cookie file format (see <b>curl(1)</b>). NOTE
  that the file specified with http.cookieFile is used only as input unless
  http.saveCookies is set.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.saveCookies</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set, store cookies received during requests to the
  file specified by http.cookieFile. Has no effect if http.cookieFile is
  unset.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.version</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use the specified HTTP protocol version when
  communicating with a server. If you want to force the default. The available
  and default version depend on libcurl. Currently the possible values of this
  option are:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;HTTP/2</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;HTTP/1.1</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">http.curloptResolve</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Hostname resolution information that will be used first
  by libcurl when sending HTTP requests. This information should be in one of
  the following formats:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;[+]HOST:PORT:ADDRESS[,ADDRESS]</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;-HOST:PORT</div>
<p class="Pp">The first format redirects all requests to the given
    <b>HOST:PORT</b> to the provided <b>ADDRESS</b>(s). The second format clears
    all previous config values for that <b>HOST:PORT</b> combination. To allow
    easy overriding of all the settings inherited from the system config, an
    empty value will reset all resolution information to the empty list.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">http.sslVersion</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The SSL version to use when negotiating an SSL
  connection, if you want to force the default. The available and default
  version depend on whether libcurl was built against NSS or OpenSSL and the
  particular configuration of the crypto library in use. Internally this sets
  the <i>CURLOPT_SSL_VERSION</i> option; see the libcurl documentation for more
  details on the format of this option and for the ssl version supported.
  Currently the possible values of this option are:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;sslv2</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;sslv3</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;tlsv1</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;tlsv1.0</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;tlsv1.1</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;tlsv1.2</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;tlsv1.3</div>
<p class="Pp">Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_SSL_VERSION</b> environment
    variable. To force git to use libcurl&#x2019;s default ssl version and
    ignore any explicit http.sslversion option, set <b>GIT_SSL_VERSION</b> to
    the empty string.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">http.sslCipherList</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A list of SSL ciphers to use when negotiating an SSL
  connection. The available ciphers depend on whether libcurl was built against
  NSS or OpenSSL and the particular configuration of the crypto library in use.
  Internally this sets the <i>CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST</i> option; see the
  libcurl documentation for more details on the format of this list.
<p class="Pp">Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST</b> environment
    variable. To force git to use libcurl&#x2019;s default cipher list and
    ignore any explicit http.sslCipherList option, set
    <b>GIT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST</b> to the empty string.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">http.sslVerify</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether to verify the SSL certificate when fetching or
  pushing over HTTPS. Defaults to true. Can be overridden by the
  <b>GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY</b> environment variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.sslCert</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">File containing the SSL certificate when fetching or
  pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_SSL_CERT</b> environment
  variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.sslKey</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">File containing the SSL private key when fetching or
  pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the <b>GIT_SSL_KEY</b> environment
  variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.sslCertPasswordProtected</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable Git&#x2019;s password prompt for the SSL
  certificate. Otherwise OpenSSL will prompt the user, possibly many times, if
  the certificate or private key is encrypted. Can be overridden by the
  <b>GIT_SSL_CERT_PASSWORD_PROTECTED</b> environment variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.sslCAInfo</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">File containing the certificates to verify the peer with
  when fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the
  <b>GIT_SSL_CAINFO</b> environment variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.sslCAPath</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Path containing files with the CA certificates to verify
  the peer with when fetching or pushing over HTTPS. Can be overridden by the
  <b>GIT_SSL_CAPATH</b> environment variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.sslBackend</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Name of the SSL backend to use (e.g. &quot;openssl&quot;
  or &quot;schannel&quot;). This option is ignored if cURL lacks support for
  choosing the SSL backend at runtime.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.schannelCheckRevoke</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Used to enforce or disable certificate revocation checks
  in cURL when http.sslBackend is set to &quot;schannel&quot;. Defaults to
  <b>true</b> if unset. Only necessary to disable this if Git consistently
  errors and the message is about checking the revocation status of a
  certificate. This option is ignored if cURL lacks support for setting the
  relevant SSL option at runtime.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.schannelUseSSLCAInfo</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">As of cURL v7.60.0, the Secure Channel backend can use
  the certificate bundle provided via <b>http.sslCAInfo</b>, but that would
  override the Windows Certificate Store. Since this is not desirable by
  default, Git will tell cURL not to use that bundle by default when the
  <b>schannel</b> backend was configured via <b>http.sslBackend</b>, unless
  <b>http.schannelUseSSLCAInfo</b> overrides this behavior.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.pinnedPubkey</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Public key of the https service. It may either be the
  filename of a PEM or DER encoded public key file or a string starting with
  <i>sha256//</i> followed by the base64 encoded sha256 hash of the public key.
  See also libcurl <i>CURLOPT_PINNEDPUBLICKEY</i>. git will exit with an error
  if this option is set but not supported by cURL.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.sslTry</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Attempt to use AUTH SSL/TLS and encrypted data transfers
  when connecting via regular FTP protocol. This might be needed if the FTP
  server requires it for security reasons or you wish to connect securely
  whenever remote FTP server supports it. Default is false since it might
  trigger certificate verification errors on misconfigured servers.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.maxRequests</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">How many HTTP requests to launch in parallel. Can be
  overridden by the <b>GIT_HTTP_MAX_REQUESTS</b> environment variable. Default
  is 5.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.minSessions</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The number of curl sessions (counted across slots) to be
  kept across requests. They will not be ended with curl_easy_cleanup() until
  http_cleanup() is invoked. If USE_CURL_MULTI is not defined, this value will
  be capped at 1. Defaults to 1.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.postBuffer</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Maximum size in bytes of the buffer used by smart HTTP
  transports when POSTing data to the remote system. For requests larger than
  this buffer size, HTTP/1.1 and Transfer-Encoding: chunked is used to avoid
  creating a massive pack file locally. Default is 1 MiB, which is sufficient
  for most requests.
<p class="Pp">Note that raising this limit is only effective for disabling
    chunked transfer encoding and therefore should be used only where the remote
    server or a proxy only supports HTTP/1.0 or is noncompliant with the HTTP
    standard. Raising this is not, in general, an effective solution for most
    push problems, but can increase memory consumption significantly since the
    entire buffer is allocated even for small pushes.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">http.lowSpeedLimit, http.lowSpeedTime</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If the HTTP transfer speed is less than
  <i>http.lowSpeedLimit</i> for longer than <i>http.lowSpeedTime</i> seconds,
  the transfer is aborted. Can be overridden by the
  <b>GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT</b> and <b>GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_TIME</b> environment
  variables.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.noEPSV</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A boolean which disables using of EPSV ftp command by
  curl. This can helpful with some &quot;poor&quot; ftp servers which
  don&#x2019;t support EPSV mode. Can be overridden by the
  <b>GIT_CURL_FTP_NO_EPSV</b> environment variable. Default is false (curl will
  use EPSV).</div>
<p class="Pp">http.userAgent</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The HTTP USER_AGENT string presented to an HTTP server.
  The default value represents the version of the client Git such as git/1.7.1.
  This option allows you to override this value to a more common value such as
  Mozilla/4.0. This may be necessary, for instance, if connecting through a
  firewall that restricts HTTP connections to a set of common USER_AGENT strings
  (but not including those like git/1.7.1). Can be overridden by the
  <b>GIT_HTTP_USER_AGENT</b> environment variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.followRedirects</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether git should follow HTTP redirects. If set to
  <b>true</b>, git will transparently follow any redirect issued by a server it
  encounters. If set to <b>false</b>, git will treat all redirects as errors. If
  set to <b>initial</b>, git will follow redirects only for the initial request
  to a remote, but not for subsequent follow-up HTTP requests. Since git uses
  the redirected URL as the base for the follow-up requests, this is generally
  sufficient. The default is <b>initial</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">http.&lt;url&gt;.*</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Any of the http.* options above can be applied
  selectively to some URLs. For a config key to match a URL, each element of the
  config key is compared to that of the URL, in the following order:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.Scheme (e.g., <b>https</b> in
  <b>https://example.com/</b>). This field must match exactly between the config
  key and the URL.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.Host/domain name (e.g., <b>example.com</b> in
  <b>https://example.com/</b>). This field must match between the config key and
  the URL. It is possible to specify a <b>*</b> as part of the host name to
  match all subdomains at this level. <b>https://*.example.com/</b> for example
  would match <b>https://foo.example.com/</b>, but not
  <b>https://foo.bar.example.com/</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Port number (e.g., <b>8080</b> in
  <b>http://example.com:8080/</b>). This field must match exactly between the
  config key and the URL. Omitted port numbers are automatically converted to
  the correct default for the scheme before matching.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.Path (e.g., <b>repo.git</b> in
  <b>https://example.com/repo.git</b>). The path field of the config key must
  match the path field of the URL either exactly or as a prefix of
  slash-delimited path elements. This means a config key with path <b>foo/</b>
  matches URL path <b>foo/bar</b>. A prefix can only match on a slash (<b>/</b>)
  boundary. Longer matches take precedence (so a config key with path
  <b>foo/bar</b> is a better match to URL path <b>foo/bar</b> than a config key
  with just path <b>foo/</b>).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 5.User name (e.g., <b>user</b> in
  <b>https://user@example.com/repo.git</b>). If the config key has a user name
  it must match the user name in the URL exactly. If the config key does not
  have a user name, that config key will match a URL with any user name
  (including none), but at a lower precedence than a config key with a user
  name.</div>
<p class="Pp">The list above is ordered by decreasing precedence; a URL that
    matches a config key&#x2019;s path is preferred to one that matches its user
    name. For example, if the URL is <b>https://user@example.com/foo/bar</b> a
    config key match of <b>https://example.com/foo</b> will be preferred over a
    config key match of <b>https://user@example.com</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">All URLs are normalized before attempting any matching (the
    password part, if embedded in the URL, is always ignored for matching
    purposes) so that equivalent URLs that are simply spelled differently will
    match properly. Environment variable settings always override any matches.
    The URLs that are matched against are those given directly to Git commands.
    This means any URLs visited as a result of a redirection do not participate
    in matching.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">i18n.commitEncoding</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Character encoding the commit messages are stored in; Git
  itself does not care per se, but this information is necessary e.g. when
  importing commits from emails or in the gitk graphical history browser (and
  possibly at other places in the future or in other porcelains). See e.g.
  <b>git-mailinfo</b>(1). Defaults to <i>utf-8</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">i18n.logOutputEncoding</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Character encoding the commit messages are converted to
  when running <i>git log</i> and friends.</div>
<p class="Pp">imap.folder</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The folder to drop the mails into, which is typically the
  Drafts folder. For example: &quot;INBOX.Drafts&quot;, &quot;INBOX/Drafts&quot;
  or &quot;[Gmail]/Drafts&quot;. Required.</div>
<p class="Pp">imap.tunnel</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Command used to setup a tunnel to the IMAP server through
  which commands will be piped instead of using a direct network connection to
  the server. Required when imap.host is not set.</div>
<p class="Pp">imap.host</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A URL identifying the server. Use an <b>imap://</b>
  prefix for non-secure connections and an <b>imaps://</b> prefix for secure
  connections. Ignored when imap.tunnel is set, but required otherwise.</div>
<p class="Pp">imap.user</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The username to use when logging in to the server.</div>
<p class="Pp">imap.pass</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The password to use when logging in to the server.</div>
<p class="Pp">imap.port</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An integer port number to connect to on the server.
  Defaults to 143 for imap:// hosts and 993 for imaps:// hosts. Ignored when
  imap.tunnel is set.</div>
<p class="Pp">imap.sslverify</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A boolean to enable/disable verification of the server
  certificate used by the SSL/TLS connection. Default is <b>true</b>. Ignored
  when imap.tunnel is set.</div>
<p class="Pp">imap.preformattedHTML</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A boolean to enable/disable the use of html encoding when
  sending a patch. An html encoded patch will be bracketed with &lt;pre&gt; and
  have a content type of text/html. Ironically, enabling this option causes
  Thunderbird to send the patch as a plain/text, format=fixed email. Default is
  <b>false</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">imap.authMethod</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify authenticate method for authentication with IMAP
  server. If Git was built with the NO_CURL option, or if your curl version is
  older than 7.34.0, or if you&#x2019;re running git-imap-send with the
  <b>--no-curl</b> option, the only supported method is <i>CRAM-MD5</i>. If this
  is not set then <i>git imap-send</i> uses the basic IMAP plaintext LOGIN
  command.</div>
<p class="Pp">index.recordEndOfIndexEntries</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies whether the index file should include an
  &quot;End Of Index Entry&quot; section. This reduces index load time on
  multiprocessor machines but produces a message &quot;ignoring EOIE
  extension&quot; when reading the index using Git versions before 2.20.
  Defaults to <i>true</i> if index.threads has been explicitly enabled,
  <i>false</i> otherwise.</div>
<p class="Pp">index.recordOffsetTable</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies whether the index file should include an
  &quot;Index Entry Offset Table&quot; section. This reduces index load time on
  multiprocessor machines but produces a message &quot;ignoring IEOT
  extension&quot; when reading the index using Git versions before 2.20.
  Defaults to <i>true</i> if index.threads has been explicitly enabled,
  <i>false</i> otherwise.</div>
<p class="Pp">index.sparse</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When enabled, write the index using sparse-directory
  entries. This has no effect unless <b>core.sparseCheckout</b> and
  <b>core.sparseCheckoutCone</b> are both enabled. Defaults to
  <i>false</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">index.threads</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the number of threads to spawn when loading the
  index. This is meant to reduce index load time on multiprocessor machines.
  Specifying 0 or <i>true</i> will cause Git to auto-detect the number of
  CPU&#x2019;s and set the number of threads accordingly. Specifying 1 or
  <i>false</i> will disable multithreading. Defaults to <i>true</i>.</div>
<p class="Pp">index.version</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the version with which new index files should be
  initialized. This does not affect existing repositories. If
  <b>feature.manyFiles</b> is enabled, then the default is 4.</div>
<p class="Pp">init.templateDir</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the directory from which templates will be
  copied. (See the &quot;TEMPLATE DIRECTORY&quot; section of
  <b>git-init</b>(1).)</div>
<p class="Pp">init.defaultBranch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allows overriding the default branch name e.g. when
  initializing a new repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">instaweb.browser</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the program that will be used to browse your
  working repository in gitweb. See <b>git-instaweb</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">instaweb.httpd</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The HTTP daemon command-line to start gitweb on your
  working repository. See <b>git-instaweb</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">instaweb.local</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true the web server started by <b>git-instaweb</b>(1)
  will be bound to the local IP (127.0.0.1).</div>
<p class="Pp">instaweb.modulePath</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default module path for <b>git-instaweb</b>(1) to use
  instead of /usr/lib/apache2/modules. Only used if httpd is Apache.</div>
<p class="Pp">instaweb.port</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The port number to bind the gitweb httpd to. See
  <b>git-instaweb</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">interactive.singleKey</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In interactive commands, allow the user to provide
  one-letter input with a single key (i.e., without hitting enter). Currently
  this is used by the <b>--patch</b> mode of <b>git-add</b>(1),
  <b>git-checkout</b>(1), <b>git-restore</b>(1), <b>git-commit</b>(1),
  <b>git-reset</b>(1), and <b>git-stash</b>(1). Note that this setting is
  silently ignored if portable keystroke input is not available; requires the
  Perl module Term::ReadKey.</div>
<p class="Pp">interactive.diffFilter</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When an interactive command (such as <b>git add
  --patch</b>) shows a colorized diff, git will pipe the diff through the shell
  command defined by this configuration variable. The command may mark up the
  diff further for human consumption, provided that it retains a one-to-one
  correspondence with the lines in the original diff. Defaults to disabled (no
  filtering).</div>
<p class="Pp">log.abbrevCommit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, makes <b>git-log</b>(1), <b>git-show</b>(1), and
  <b>git-whatchanged</b>(1) assume <b>--abbrev-commit</b>. You may override this
  option with <b>--no-abbrev-commit</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">log.date</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set the default date-time mode for the <i>log</i>
  command. Setting a value for log.date is similar to using <i>git log</i>'s
  <b>--date</b> option. See <b>git-log</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">log.decorate</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown by
  the log command. If <i>short</i> is specified, the ref name prefixes
  <i>refs/heads/</i>, <i>refs/tags/</i> and <i>refs/remotes/</i> will not be
  printed. If <i>full</i> is specified, the full ref name (including prefix)
  will be printed. If <i>auto</i> is specified, then if the output is going to a
  terminal, the ref names are shown as if <i>short</i> were given, otherwise no
  ref names are shown. This is the same as the <b>--decorate</b> option of the
  <b>git log</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">log.excludeDecoration</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Exclude the specified patterns from the log decorations.
  This is similar to the <b>--decorate-refs-exclude</b> command-line option, but
  the config option can be overridden by the <b>--decorate-refs</b>
  option.</div>
<p class="Pp">log.diffMerges</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set default diff format to be used for merge commits. See
  <b>--diff-merges</b> in <b>git-log</b>(1) for details. Defaults to
  <b>separate</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">log.follow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If <b>true</b>, <b>git log</b> will act as if the
  <b>--follow</b> option was used when a single &lt;path&gt; is given. This has
  the same limitations as <b>--follow</b>, i.e. it cannot be used to follow
  multiple files and does not work well on non-linear history.</div>
<p class="Pp">log.graphColors</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A list of colors, separated by commas, that can be used
  to draw history lines in <b>git log --graph</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">log.showRoot</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, the initial commit will be shown as a big
  creation event. This is equivalent to a diff against an empty tree. Tools like
  <b>git-log</b>(1) or <b>git-whatchanged</b>(1), which normally hide the root
  commit will now show it. True by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">log.showSignature</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, makes <b>git-log</b>(1), <b>git-show</b>(1), and
  <b>git-whatchanged</b>(1) assume <b>--show-signature</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">log.mailmap</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, makes <b>git-log</b>(1), <b>git-show</b>(1), and
  <b>git-whatchanged</b>(1) assume <b>--use-mailmap</b>, otherwise assume
  <b>--no-use-mailmap</b>. True by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">lsrefs.unborn</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">May be &quot;advertise&quot; (the default),
  &quot;allow&quot;, or &quot;ignore&quot;. If &quot;advertise&quot;, the server
  will respond to the client sending &quot;unborn&quot; (as described in
  protocol-v2.txt) and will advertise support for this feature during the
  protocol v2 capability advertisement. &quot;allow&quot; is the same as
  &quot;advertise&quot; except that the server will not advertise support for
  this feature; this is useful for load-balanced servers that cannot be updated
  atomically (for example), since the administrator could configure
  &quot;allow&quot;, then after a delay, configure &quot;advertise&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">mailinfo.scissors</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, makes <b>git-mailinfo</b>(1) (and therefore
  <b>git-am</b>(1)) act by default as if the --scissors option was provided on
  the command-line. When active, this features removes everything from the
  message body before a scissors line (i.e. consisting mainly of
  &quot;&gt;8&quot;, &quot;8&lt;&quot; and &quot;-&quot;).</div>
<p class="Pp">mailmap.file</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The location of an augmenting mailmap file. The default
  mailmap, located in the root of the repository, is loaded first, then the
  mailmap file pointed to by this variable. The location of the mailmap file may
  be in a repository subdirectory, or somewhere outside of the repository
  itself. See <b>git-shortlog</b>(1) and <b>git-blame</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">mailmap.blob</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Like <b>mailmap.file</b>, but consider the value as a
  reference to a blob in the repository. If both <b>mailmap.file</b> and
  <b>mailmap.blob</b> are given, both are parsed, with entries from
  <b>mailmap.file</b> taking precedence. In a bare repository, this defaults to
  <b>HEAD:.mailmap</b>. In a non-bare repository, it defaults to empty.</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This boolean config option controls whether some commands
  run <b>git maintenance run --auto</b> after doing their normal work. Defaults
  to true.</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.strategy</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This string config option provides a way to specify one
  of a few recommended schedules for background maintenance. This only affects
  which tasks are run during <b>git maintenance run --schedule=X</b> commands,
  provided no <b>--task=&lt;task&gt;</b> arguments are provided. Further, if a
  <b>maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.schedule</b> config value is set, then that value
  is used instead of the one provided by <b>maintenance.strategy</b>. The
  possible strategy strings are:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>none</b>: This default setting implies no task
  are run at any schedule.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>incremental</b>: This setting optimizes for
  performing small maintenance activities that do not delete any data. This does
  not schedule the <b>gc</b> task, but runs the <b>prefetch</b> and
  <b>commit-graph</b> tasks hourly, the <b>loose-objects</b> and
  <b>incremental-repack</b> tasks daily, and the <b>pack-refs</b> task
  weekly.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.enabled</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This boolean config option controls whether the
  maintenance task with name <b>&lt;task&gt;</b> is run when no <b>--task</b>
  option is specified to <b>git maintenance run</b>. These config values are
  ignored if a <b>--task</b> option exists. By default, only
  <b>maintenance.gc.enabled</b> is true.</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.&lt;task&gt;.schedule</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This config option controls whether or not the given
  <b>&lt;task&gt;</b> runs during a <b>git maintenance run
  --schedule=&lt;frequency&gt;</b> command. The value must be one of
  &quot;hourly&quot;, &quot;daily&quot;, or &quot;weekly&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.commit-graph.auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This integer config option controls how often the
  <b>commit-graph</b> task should be run as part of <b>git maintenance run
  --auto</b>. If zero, then the <b>commit-graph</b> task will not run with the
  <b>--auto</b> option. A negative value will force the task to run every time.
  Otherwise, a positive value implies the command should run when the number of
  reachable commits that are not in the commit-graph file is at least the value
  of <b>maintenance.commit-graph.auto</b>. The default value is 100.</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.loose-objects.auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This integer config option controls how often the
  <b>loose-objects</b> task should be run as part of <b>git maintenance run
  --auto</b>. If zero, then the <b>loose-objects</b> task will not run with the
  <b>--auto</b> option. A negative value will force the task to run every time.
  Otherwise, a positive value implies the command should run when the number of
  loose objects is at least the value of <b>maintenance.loose-objects.auto</b>.
  The default value is 100.</div>
<p class="Pp">maintenance.incremental-repack.auto</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This integer config option controls how often the
  <b>incremental-repack</b> task should be run as part of <b>git maintenance run
  --auto</b>. If zero, then the <b>incremental-repack</b> task will not run with
  the <b>--auto</b> option. A negative value will force the task to run every
  time. Otherwise, a positive value implies the command should run when the
  number of pack-files not in the multi-pack-index is at least the value of
  <b>maintenance.incremental-repack.auto</b>. The default value is 10.</div>
<p class="Pp">man.viewer</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the programs that may be used to display help in
  the <i>man</i> format. See <b>git-help</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">man.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the command to invoke the specified man viewer.
  The specified command is evaluated in shell with the man page passed as
  argument. (See <b>git-help</b>(1).)</div>
<p class="Pp">man.&lt;tool&gt;.path</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Override the path for the given tool that may be used to
  display help in the <i>man</i> format. See <b>git-help</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.conflictStyle</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the style in which conflicted hunks are written
  out to working tree files upon merge. The default is &quot;merge&quot;, which
  shows a <b>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</b> conflict marker, changes made by
  one side, a <b>=======</b> marker, changes made by the other side, and then a
  <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</b> marker. An alternate style,
  &quot;diff3&quot;, adds a <b>|||||||</b> marker and the original text before
  the <b>=======</b> marker. The &quot;merge&quot; style tends to produce
  smaller conflict regions than diff3, both because of the exclusion of the
  original text, and because when a subset of lines match on the two sides they
  are just pulled out of the conflict region. Another alternate style,
  &quot;zdiff3&quot;, is similar to diff3 but removes matching lines on the two
  sides from the conflict region when those matching lines appear near either
  the beginning or end of a conflict region.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.defaultToUpstream</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If merge is called without any commit argument, merge the
  upstream branches configured for the current branch by using their last
  observed values stored in their remote-tracking branches. The values of the
  <b>branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.merge</b> that name the branches at the
  remote named by <b>branch.&lt;current branch&gt;.remote</b> are consulted, and
  then they are mapped via <b>remote.&lt;remote&gt;.fetch</b> to their
  corresponding remote-tracking branches, and the tips of these tracking
  branches are merged. Defaults to true.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.ff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit
  when merging a commit that is a descendant of the current commit. Instead, the
  tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded. When set to <b>false</b>, this
  variable tells Git to create an extra merge commit in such a case (equivalent
  to giving the <b>--no-ff</b> option from the command line). When set to
  <b>only</b>, only such fast-forward merges are allowed (equivalent to giving
  the <b>--ff-only</b> option from the command line).</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.verifySignatures</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, this is equivalent to the --verify-signatures
  command line option. See <b>git-merge</b>(1) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.branchdesc</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to branch names, populate the log message
  with the branch description text associated with them. Defaults to
  false.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.log</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to branch names, populate the log message
  with at most the specified number of one-line descriptions from the actual
  commits that are being merged. Defaults to false, and true is a synonym for
  20.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.suppressDest</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By adding a glob that matches the names of integration
  branches to this multi-valued configuration variable, the default merge
  message computed for merges into these integration branches will omit
  &quot;into &lt;branch name&gt;&quot; from its title.
<p class="Pp">An element with an empty value can be used to clear the list of
    globs accumulated from previous configuration entries. When there is no
    <b>merge.suppressDest</b> variable defined, the default value of
    <b>master</b> is used for backward compatibility.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.renameLimit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The number of files to consider in the exhaustive portion
  of rename detection during a merge. If not specified, defaults to the value of
  diff.renameLimit. If neither merge.renameLimit nor diff.renameLimit are
  specified, currently defaults to 7000. This setting has no effect if rename
  detection is turned off.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.renames</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether Git detects renames. If set to &quot;false&quot;,
  rename detection is disabled. If set to &quot;true&quot;, basic rename
  detection is enabled. Defaults to the value of diff.renames.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.directoryRenames</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether Git detects directory renames, affecting what
  happens at merge time to new files added to a directory on one side of history
  when that directory was renamed on the other side of history. If
  merge.directoryRenames is set to &quot;false&quot;, directory rename detection
  is disabled, meaning that such new files will be left behind in the old
  directory. If set to &quot;true&quot;, directory rename detection is enabled,
  meaning that such new files will be moved into the new directory. If set to
  &quot;conflict&quot;, a conflict will be reported for such paths. If
  merge.renames is false, merge.directoryRenames is ignored and treated as
  false. Defaults to &quot;conflict&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.renormalize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Tell Git that canonical representation of files in the
  repository has changed over time (e.g. earlier commits record text files with
  CRLF line endings, but recent ones use LF line endings). In such a repository,
  Git can convert the data recorded in commits to a canonical form before
  performing a merge to reduce unnecessary conflicts. For more information, see
  section &quot;Merging branches with differing checkin/checkout
  attributes&quot; in <b>gitattributes</b>(5).</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.stat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether to print the diffstat between ORIG_HEAD and the
  merge result at the end of the merge. True by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.autoStash</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When set to true, automatically create a temporary stash
  entry before the operation begins, and apply it after the operation ends. This
  means that you can run merge on a dirty worktree. However, use with care: the
  final stash application after a successful merge might result in non-trivial
  conflicts. This option can be overridden by the <b>--no-autostash</b> and
  <b>--autostash</b> options of <b>git-merge</b>(1). Defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.tool</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Controls which merge tool is used by
  <b>git-mergetool</b>(1). The list below shows the valid built-in values. Any
  other value is treated as a custom merge tool and requires that a
  corresponding mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd variable is defined.</div>
<p class="Pp">merge.guitool</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Controls which merge tool is used by
  <b>git-mergetool</b>(1) when the -g/--gui flag is specified. The list below
  shows the valid built-in values. Any other value is treated as a custom merge
  tool and requires that a corresponding mergetool.&lt;guitool&gt;.cmd variable
  is defined.

  checked and the merge assumed to have been successful if the file has been
  updated, otherwise the user is prompted to indicate the success of the
  merge.</div>
<p class="Pp">mergetool.meld.hasOutput</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Older versions of <b>meld</b> do not support the
  <b>--output</b> option. Git will attempt to detect whether <b>meld</b>
  supports <b>--output</b> by inspecting the output of <b>meld --help</b>.
  Configuring <b>mergetool.meld.hasOutput</b> will make Git skip these checks
  and use the configured value instead. Setting <b>mergetool.meld.hasOutput</b>
  to <b>true</b> tells Git to unconditionally use the <b>--output</b> option,
  and <b>false</b> avoids using <b>--output</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">mergetool.meld.useAutoMerge</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When the <b>--auto-merge</b> is given, meld will merge
  all non-conflicting parts automatically, highlight the conflicting parts and
  wait for user decision. Setting <b>mergetool.meld.useAutoMerge</b> to
  <b>true</b> tells Git to unconditionally use the <b>--auto-merge</b> option
  with <b>meld</b>. Setting this value to <b>auto</b> makes git detect whether
  <b>--auto-merge</b> is supported and will only use <b>--auto-merge</b> when
  available. A value of <b>false</b> avoids using <b>--auto-merge</b>
  altogether, and is the default value.</div>
<p class="Pp">mergetool.vimdiff.layout</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The vimdiff backend uses this variable to control how its
  split windows look like. Applies even if you are using Neovim (<b>nvim</b>) or
  gVim (<b>gvim</b>) as the merge tool. See BACKEND SPECIFIC HINTS section in
  <b>git-mergetool</b>(1). for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">mergetool.hideResolved</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">During a merge Git will automatically resolve as many
  conflicts as possible and write the <i>MERGED</i> file containing conflict
  markers around any conflicts that it cannot resolve; <i>LOCAL</i> and
  <i>REMOTE</i> normally represent the versions of the file from before
  Git&#x2019;s conflict resolution. This flag causes <i>LOCAL</i> and
  <i>REMOTE</i> to be overwriten so that only the unresolved conflicts are
  presented to the merge tool. Can be configured per-tool via the
  <b>mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.hideResolved</b> configuration variable. Defaults to
  <b>false</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">mergetool.keepBackup</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">After performing a merge, the original file with conflict
  markers can be saved as a file with a <b>.orig</b> extension. If this variable
  is set to <b>false</b> then this file is not preserved. Defaults to
  <b>true</b> (i.e. keep the backup files).</div>
<p class="Pp">mergetool.keepTemporaries</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When invoking a custom merge tool, Git uses a set of
  temporary files to pass to the tool. If the tool returns an error and this
  variable is set to <b>true</b>, then these temporary files will be preserved,
  otherwise they will be removed after the tool has exited. Defaults to
  <b>false</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">mergetool.writeToTemp</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Git writes temporary <i>BASE</i>, <i>LOCAL</i>, and
  <i>REMOTE</i> versions of conflicting files in the worktree by default. Git
  will attempt to use a temporary directory for these files when set
  <b>true</b>. Defaults to <b>false</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">mergetool.prompt</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prompt before each invocation of the merge resolution
  program.</div>
<p class="Pp">notes.mergeStrategy</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Which merge strategy to choose by default when resolving
  notes conflicts. Must be one of <b>manual</b>, <b>ours</b>, <b>theirs</b>,
  <b>union</b>, or <b>cat_sort_uniq</b>. Defaults to <b>manual</b>. See
  &quot;NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES&quot; section of <b>git-notes</b>(1) for more
  information on each strategy.</div>
<p class="Pp">notes.&lt;name&gt;.mergeStrategy</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Which merge strategy to choose when doing a notes merge
  into refs/notes/&lt;name&gt;. This overrides the more general
  &quot;notes.mergeStrategy&quot;. See the &quot;NOTES MERGE STRATEGIES&quot;
  section in <b>git-notes</b>(1) for more information on the available
  strategies.</div>
<p class="Pp">notes.displayRef</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The (fully qualified) refname from which to show notes
  when showing commit messages. The value of this variable can be set to a glob,
  in which case notes from all matching refs will be shown. You may also specify
  this configuration variable several times. A warning will be issued for refs
  that do not exist, but a glob that does not match any refs is silently
  ignored.
<p class="Pp">This setting can be overridden with the
    <b>GIT_NOTES_DISPLAY_REF</b> environment variable, which must be a colon
    separated list of refs or globs.</p>
<p class="Pp">The effective value of &quot;core.notesRef&quot; (possibly
    overridden by GIT_NOTES_REF) is also implicitly added to the list of refs to
    be displayed.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When rewriting commits with &lt;command&gt; (currently
  <b>amend</b> or <b>rebase</b>) and this variable is set to <b>true</b>, Git
  automatically copies your notes from the original to the rewritten commit.
  Defaults to <b>true</b>, but see &quot;notes.rewriteRef&quot; below.</div>
<p class="Pp">notes.rewriteMode</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When copying notes during a rewrite (see the
  &quot;notes.rewrite.&lt;command&gt;&quot; option), determines what to do if
  the target commit already has a note. Must be one of <b>overwrite</b>,
  <b>concatenate</b>, <b>cat_sort_uniq</b>, or <b>ignore</b>. Defaults to
  <b>concatenate</b>.
<p class="Pp">This setting can be overridden with the
    <b>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_MODE</b> environment variable.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">notes.rewriteRef</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When copying notes during a rewrite, specifies the (fully
  qualified) ref whose notes should be copied. The ref may be a glob, in which
  case notes in all matching refs will be copied. You may also specify this
  configuration several times.
<p class="Pp">Does not have a default value; you must configure this variable to
    enable note rewriting. Set it to <b>refs/notes/commits</b> to enable
    rewriting for the default commit notes.</p>
<p class="Pp">This setting can be overridden with the
    <b>GIT_NOTES_REWRITE_REF</b> environment variable, which must be a colon
    separated list of refs or globs.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.window</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The size of the window used by <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1)
  when no window size is given on the command line. Defaults to 10.</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.depth</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The maximum delta depth used by
  <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1) when no maximum depth is given on the command line.
  Defaults to 50. Maximum value is 4095.</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.windowMemory</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The maximum size of memory that is consumed by each
  thread in <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1) for pack window memory when no limit is
  given on the command line. The value can be suffixed with &quot;k&quot;,
  &quot;m&quot;, or &quot;g&quot;. When left unconfigured (or set explicitly to
  0), there will be no limit.</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.compression</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An integer -1..9, indicating the compression level for
  objects in a pack file. -1 is the zlib default. 0 means no compression, and
  1..9 are various speed/size tradeoffs, 9 being slowest. If not set, defaults
  to core.compression. If that is not set, defaults to -1, the zlib default,
  which is &quot;a default compromise between speed and compression (currently
  equivalent to level 6).&quot;
<p class="Pp">Note that changing the compression level will not automatically
    recompress all existing objects. You can force recompression by passing the
    -F option to <b>git-repack</b>(1).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.allowPackReuse</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When true, and when reachability bitmaps are enabled,
  pack-objects will try to send parts of the bitmapped packfile verbatim. This
  can reduce memory and CPU usage to serve fetches, but might result in sending
  a slightly larger pack. Defaults to true.</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.island</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An extended regular expression configuring a set of delta
  islands. See &quot;DELTA ISLANDS&quot; in <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1) for
  details.</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.islandCore</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify an island name which gets to have its objects be
  packed first. This creates a kind of pseudo-pack at the front of one pack, so
  that the objects from the specified island are hopefully faster to copy into
  any pack that should be served to a user requesting these objects. In practice
  this means that the island specified should likely correspond to what is the
  most commonly cloned in the repo. See also &quot;DELTA ISLANDS&quot; in
  <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.deltaCacheSize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The maximum memory in bytes used for caching deltas in
  <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1) before writing them out to a pack. This cache is
  used to speed up the writing object phase by not having to recompute the final
  delta result once the best match for all objects is found. Repacking large
  repositories on machines which are tight with memory might be badly impacted
  by this though, especially if this cache pushes the system into swapping. A
  value of 0 means no limit. The smallest size of 1 byte may be used to
  virtually disable this cache. Defaults to 256 MiB.</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.deltaCacheLimit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The maximum size of a delta, that is cached in
  <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1). This cache is used to speed up the writing object
  phase by not having to recompute the final delta result once the best match
  for all objects is found. Defaults to 1000. Maximum value is 65535.</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.threads</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies the number of threads to spawn when searching
  for best delta matches. This requires that <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1) be
  compiled with pthreads otherwise this option is ignored with a warning. This
  is meant to reduce packing time on multiprocessor machines. The required
  amount of memory for the delta search window is however multiplied by the
  number of threads. Specifying 0 will cause Git to auto-detect the number of
  CPU&#x2019;s and set the number of threads accordingly.</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.indexVersion</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the default pack index version. Valid values are
  1 for legacy pack index used by Git versions prior to 1.5.2, and 2 for the new
  pack index with capabilities for packs larger than 4 GB as well as proper
  protection against the repacking of corrupted packs. Version 2 is the default.
  Note that version 2 is enforced and this config option ignored whenever the
  corresponding pack is larger than 2 GB.
<p class="Pp">If you have an old Git that does not understand the version 2
    <b>*.idx</b> file, cloning or fetching over a non native protocol (e.g.
    &quot;http&quot;) that will copy both <b>*.pack</b> file and corresponding
    <b>*.idx</b> file from the other side may give you a repository that cannot
    be accessed with your older version of Git. If the <b>*.pack</b> file is
    smaller than 2 GB, however, you can use <b>git-index-pack</b>(1) on the
    *.pack file to regenerate the <b>*.idx</b> file.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.packSizeLimit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The maximum size of a pack. This setting only affects
  packing to a file when repacking, i.e. the git:// protocol is unaffected. It
  can be overridden by the <b>--max-pack-size</b> option of
  <b>git-repack</b>(1). Reaching this limit results in the creation of multiple
  packfiles.
<p class="Pp">Note that this option is rarely useful, and may result in a larger
    total on-disk size (because Git will not store deltas between packs), as
    well as worse runtime performance (object lookup within multiple packs is
    slower than a single pack, and optimizations like reachability bitmaps
    cannot cope with multiple packs).</p>
<p class="Pp">If you need to actively run Git using smaller packfiles (e.g.,
    because your filesystem does not support large files), this option may help.
    But if your goal is to transmit a packfile over a medium that supports
    limited sizes (e.g., removable media that cannot store the whole
    repository), you are likely better off creating a single large packfile and
    splitting it using a generic multi-volume archive tool (e.g., Unix
    <b>split</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">The minimum size allowed is limited to 1 MiB. The default is
    unlimited. Common unit suffixes of <i>k</i>, <i>m</i>, or <i>g</i> are
    supported.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.useBitmaps</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When true, git will use pack bitmaps (if available) when
  packing to stdout (e.g., during the server side of a fetch). Defaults to true.
  You should not generally need to turn this off unless you are debugging pack
  bitmaps.</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.useSparse</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When true, git will default to using the <i>--sparse</i>
  option in <i>git pack-objects</i> when the <i>--revs</i> option is present.
  This algorithm only walks trees that appear in paths that introduce new
  objects. This can have significant performance benefits when computing a pack
  to send a small change. However, it is possible that extra objects are added
  to the pack-file if the included commits contain certain types of direct
  renames. Default is <b>true</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.preferBitmapTips</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When selecting which commits will receive bitmaps, prefer
  a commit at the tip of any reference that is a suffix of any value of this
  configuration over any other commits in the &quot;selection window&quot;.
<p class="Pp">Note that setting this configuration to <b>refs/foo</b> does not
    mean that the commits at the tips of <b>refs/foo/bar</b> and
    <b>refs/foo/baz</b> will necessarily be selected. This is because commits
    are selected for bitmaps from within a series of windows of variable
  length.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a commit at the tip of any reference which is a suffix of any
    value of this configuration is seen in a window, it is immediately given
    preference over any other commit in that window.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.writeBitmaps (deprecated)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is a deprecated synonym for
  <b>repack.writeBitmaps</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.writeBitmapHashCache</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When true, git will include a &quot;hash cache&quot;
  section in the bitmap index (if one is written). This cache can be used to
  feed git&#x2019;s delta heuristics, potentially leading to better deltas
  between bitmapped and non-bitmapped objects (e.g., when serving a fetch
  between an older, bitmapped pack and objects that have been pushed since the
  last gc). The downside is that it consumes 4 bytes per object of disk space.
  Defaults to true.
<p class="Pp">When writing a multi-pack reachability bitmap, no new namehashes
    are computed; instead, any namehashes stored in an existing bitmap are
    permuted into their appropriate location when writing a new bitmap.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">pack.writeReverseIndex</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When true, git will write a corresponding .rev file (see:
  <b>Documentation/technical/pack-format.txt</b>[1]) for each new packfile that
  it writes in all places except for <b>git-fast-import</b>(1) and in the bulk
  checkin mechanism. Defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">pager.&lt;cmd&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If the value is boolean, turns on or off pagination of
  the output of a particular Git subcommand when writing to a tty. Otherwise,
  turns on pagination for the subcommand using the pager specified by the value
  of <b>pager.&lt;cmd&gt;</b>. If <b>--paginate</b> or <b>--no-pager</b> is
  specified on the command line, it takes precedence over this option. To
  disable pagination for all commands, set <b>core.pager</b> or <b>GIT_PAGER</b>
  to <b>cat</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">pretty.&lt;name&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Alias for a --pretty= format string, as specified in
  <b>git-log</b>(1). Any aliases defined here can be used just as the built-in
  pretty formats could. For example, running <b>git config pretty.changelog
  &quot;format:* %H %s&quot;</b> would cause the invocation <b>git log
  --pretty=changelog</b> to be equivalent to running <b>git log
  &quot;--pretty=format:* %H %s&quot;</b>. Note that an alias with the same name
  as a built-in format will be silently ignored.</div>
<p class="Pp">protocol.allow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set, provide a user defined default policy for all
  protocols which don&#x2019;t explicitly have a policy
  (<b>protocol.&lt;name&gt;.allow</b>). By default, if unset, known-safe
  protocols (http, https, git, ssh, file) have a default policy of
  <b>always</b>, known-dangerous protocols (ext) have a default policy of
  <b>never</b>, and all other protocols have a default policy of <b>user</b>.
  Supported policies:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>always</b> - protocol is always able to be
  used.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>never</b> - protocol is never able to be
  used.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>user</b> - protocol is only able to be used
  when <b>GIT_PROTOCOL_FROM_USER</b> is either unset or has a value of 1. This
  policy should be used when you want a protocol to be directly usable by the
  user but don&#x2019;t want it used by commands which execute clone/fetch/push
  commands without user input, e.g. recursive submodule initialization.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">protocol.&lt;name&gt;.allow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set a policy to be used by protocol <b>&lt;name&gt;</b>
  with clone/fetch/push commands. See <b>protocol.allow</b> above for the
  available policies.
<p class="Pp">The protocol names currently used by git are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>file</b>: any local file-based path (including
  <b>file://</b> URLs, or local paths)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>git</b>: the anonymous git protocol over a
  direct TCP connection (or proxy, if configured)</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>ssh</b>: git over ssh (including
  <b>host:path</b> syntax, <b>ssh://</b>, etc).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>http</b>: git over http, both &quot;smart
  http&quot; and &quot;dumb http&quot;. Note that this does <i>not</i> include
  <b>https</b>; if you want to configure both, you must do so
  individually.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;any external helpers are named by their protocol
  (e.g., use <b>hg</b> to allow the <b>git-remote-hg</b> helper)</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">protocol.version</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set, clients will attempt to communicate with a server
  using the specified protocol version. If the server does not support it,
  communication falls back to version 0. If unset, the default is <b>2</b>.
  Supported versions:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>0</b> - the original wire protocol.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>1</b> - the original wire protocol with the
  addition of a version string in the initial response from the server.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>2</b> - <b>wire protocol version
  2</b>[2].</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">pull.ff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit
  when merging a commit that is a descendant of the current commit. Instead, the
  tip of the current branch is fast-forwarded. When set to <b>false</b>, this
  variable tells Git to create an extra merge commit in such a case (equivalent
  to giving the <b>--no-ff</b> option from the command line). When set to
  <b>only</b>, only such fast-forward merges are allowed (equivalent to giving
  the <b>--ff-only</b> option from the command line). This setting overrides
  <b>merge.ff</b> when pulling.</div>
<p class="Pp">pull.rebase</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When true, rebase branches on top of the fetched branch,
  instead of merging the default branch from the default remote when &quot;git
  pull&quot; is run. See &quot;branch.&lt;name&gt;.rebase&quot; for setting this
  on a per-branch basis.
<p class="Pp">When <b>merges</b> (or just <i>m</i>), pass the
    <b>--rebase-merges</b> option to <i>git rebase</i> so that the local merge
    commits are included in the rebase (see <b>git-rebase</b>(1) for
  details).</p>
<p class="Pp">When the value is <b>interactive</b> (or just <i>i</i>), the
    rebase is run in interactive mode.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b>: this is a possibly dangerous operation; do <b>not</b>
    use it unless you understand the implications (see <b>git-rebase</b>(1) for
    details).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">pull.octopus</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default merge strategy to use when pulling multiple
  branches at once.</div>
<p class="Pp">pull.twohead</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default merge strategy to use when pulling a single
  branch.</div>
<p class="Pp">push.autoSetupRemote</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to &quot;true&quot; assume <b>--set-upstream</b>
  on default push when no upstream tracking exists for the current branch; this
  option takes effect with push.default options <i>simple</i>, <i>upstream</i>,
  and <i>current</i>. It is useful if by default you want new branches to be
  pushed to the default remote (like the behavior of
  <i>push.default=current</i>) and you also want the upstream tracking to be
  set. Workflows most likely to benefit from this option are <i>simple</i>
  central workflows where all branches are expected to have the same name on the
  remote.</div>
<p class="Pp">push.default</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Defines the action <b>git push</b> should take if no
  refspec is given (whether from the command-line, config, or elsewhere).
  Different values are well-suited for specific workflows; for instance, in a
  purely central workflow (i.e. the fetch source is equal to the push
  destination), <b>upstream</b> is probably what you want. Possible values are:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>nothing</b> - do not push anything (error out)
  unless a refspec is given. This is primarily meant for people who want to
  avoid mistakes by always being explicit.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>current</b> - push the current branch to
  update a branch with the same name on the receiving end. Works in both central
  and non-central workflows.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>upstream</b> - push the current branch back to
  the branch whose changes are usually integrated into the current branch (which
  is called <b>@{upstream}</b>). This mode only makes sense if you are pushing
  to the same repository you would normally pull from (i.e. central
  workflow).</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>tracking</b> - This is a deprecated synonym
  for <b>upstream</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>simple</b> - pushes the current branch with
  the same name on the remote.
<p class="Pp">If you are working on a centralized workflow (pushing to the same
    repository you pull from, which is typically <b>origin</b>), then you need
    to configure an upstream branch with the same name.</p>
<p class="Pp">This mode is the default since Git 2.0, and is the safest option
    suited for beginners.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>matching</b> - push all branches having the
  same name on both ends. This makes the repository you are pushing to remember
  the set of branches that will be pushed out (e.g. if you always push
  <i>maint</i> and <i>master</i> there and no other branches, the repository you
  push to will have these two branches, and your local <i>maint</i> and
  <i>master</i> will be pushed there).
<p class="Pp">To use this mode effectively, you have to make sure <i>all</i> the
    branches you would push out are ready to be pushed out before running <i>git
    push</i>, as the whole point of this mode is to allow you to push all of the
    branches in one go. If you usually finish work on only one branch and push
    out the result, while other branches are unfinished, this mode is not for
    you. Also this mode is not suitable for pushing into a shared central
    repository, as other people may add new branches there, or update the tip of
    existing branches outside your control.</p>
<p class="Pp">This used to be the default, but not since Git 2.0 (<b>simple</b>
    is the new default).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">push.followTags</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true enable <b>--follow-tags</b> option by
  default. You may override this configuration at time of push by specifying
  <b>--no-follow-tags</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">push.gpgSign</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">May be set to a boolean value, or the string
  <i>if-asked</i>. A true value causes all pushes to be GPG signed, as if
  <b>--signed</b> is passed to <b>git-push</b>(1). The string <i>if-asked</i>
  causes pushes to be signed if the server supports it, as if
  <b>--signed=if-asked</b> is passed to <i>git push</i>. A false value may
  override a value from a lower-priority config file. An explicit command-line
  flag always overrides this config option.</div>
<p class="Pp">push.pushOption</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When no <b>--push-option=&lt;option&gt;</b> argument is
  given from the command line, <b>git push</b> behaves as if each &lt;value&gt;
  of this variable is given as <b>--push-option=&lt;value&gt;</b>.
<p class="Pp">This is a multi-valued variable, and an empty value can be used in
    a higher priority configuration file (e.g. <b>.git/config</b> in a
    repository) to clear the values inherited from a lower priority
    configuration files (e.g. <b>$HOME/.gitconfig</b>).</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">Make sure all submodule commits used by the revisions to
  be pushed are available on a remote-tracking branch. If the value is
  <i>check</i> then Git will verify that all submodule commits that changed in
  the revisions to be pushed are available on at least one remote of the
  submodule. If any commits are missing, the push will be aborted and exit with
  non-zero status. If the value is <i>on-demand</i> then all submodules that
  changed in the revisions to be pushed will be pushed. If on-demand was not
  able to push all necessary revisions it will also be aborted and exit with
  non-zero status. If the value is <i>no</i> then default behavior of ignoring
  submodules when pushing is retained. You may override this configuration at
  time of push by specifying <i>--recurse-submodules=check|on-demand|no</i>. If
  not set, <i>no</i> is used by default, unless <i>submodule.recurse</i> is set
  (in which case a <i>true</i> value means <i>on-demand</i>).</div>
<p class="Pp">push.useForceIfIncludes</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to &quot;true&quot;, it is equivalent to
  specifying <b>--force-if-includes</b> as an option to <b>git-push</b>(1) in
  the command line. Adding <b>--no-force-if-includes</b> at the time of push
  overrides this configuration setting.</div>
<p class="Pp">push.negotiate</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to &quot;true&quot;, attempt to reduce the size of
  the packfile sent by rounds of negotiation in which the client and the server
  attempt to find commits in common. If &quot;false&quot;, Git will rely solely
  on the server&#x2019;s ref advertisement to find commits in common.</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.backend</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Default backend to use for rebasing. Possible choices are
  <i>apply</i> or <i>merge</i>. In the future, if the merge backend gains all
  remaining capabilities of the apply backend, this setting may become
  unused.</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.stat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether to show a diffstat of what changed upstream since
  the last rebase. False by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.autoSquash</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true enable <b>--autosquash</b> option by
  default.</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.autoStash</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When set to true, automatically create a temporary stash
  entry before the operation begins, and apply it after the operation ends. This
  means that you can run rebase on a dirty worktree. However, use with care: the
  final stash application after a successful rebase might result in non-trivial
  conflicts. This option can be overridden by the <b>--no-autostash</b> and
  <b>--autostash</b> options of <b>git-rebase</b>(1). Defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.missingCommitsCheck</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to &quot;warn&quot;, git rebase -i will print a
  warning if some commits are removed (e.g. a line was deleted), however the
  rebase will still proceed. If set to &quot;error&quot;, it will print the
  previous warning and stop the rebase, <i>git rebase --edit-todo</i> can then
  be used to correct the error. If set to &quot;ignore&quot;, no checking is
  done. To drop a commit without warning or error, use the <b>drop</b> command
  in the todo list. Defaults to &quot;ignore&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.instructionFormat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A format string, as specified in <b>git-log</b>(1), to be
  used for the todo list during an interactive rebase. The format will
  automatically have the long commit hash prepended to the format.</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.abbreviateCommands</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, <b>git rebase</b> will use abbreviated
  command names in the todo list resulting in something like this:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        p deadbee The oneline of the commit
        p fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit
        ...
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">instead of:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
        pick deadbee The oneline of the commit
        pick fa1afe1 The oneline of the next commit
        ...
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Defaults to false.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.rescheduleFailedExec</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Automatically reschedule <b>exec</b> commands that
  failed. This only makes sense in interactive mode (or when an <b>--exec</b>
  option was provided). This is the same as specifying the
  <b>--reschedule-failed-exec</b> option.</div>
<p class="Pp">rebase.forkPoint</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to false set <b>--no-fork-point</b> option by
  default.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.advertiseAtomic</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, git-receive-pack will advertise the atomic
  push capability to its clients. If you don&#x2019;t want to advertise this
  capability, set this variable to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.advertisePushOptions</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When set to true, git-receive-pack will advertise the
  push options capability to its clients. False by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.autogc</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, git-receive-pack will run &quot;git-gc
  --auto&quot; after receiving data from git-push and updating refs. You can
  stop it by setting this variable to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.certNonceSeed</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By setting this variable to a string, <b>git
  receive-pack</b> will accept a <b>git push --signed</b> and verifies it by
  using a &quot;nonce&quot; protected by HMAC using this string as a secret
  key.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.certNonceSlop</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When a <b>git push --signed</b> sent a push certificate
  with a &quot;nonce&quot; that was issued by a receive-pack serving the same
  repository within this many seconds, export the &quot;nonce&quot; found in the
  certificate to <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE</b> to the hooks (instead of what the
  receive-pack asked the sending side to include). This may allow writing checks
  in <b>pre-receive</b> and <b>post-receive</b> a bit easier. Instead of
  checking <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_SLOP</b> environment variable that records by
  how many seconds the nonce is stale to decide if they want to accept the
  certificate, they only can check <b>GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_STATUS</b> is
  <b>OK</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.fsckObjects</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If it is set to true, git-receive-pack will check all
  received objects. See <b>transfer.fsckObjects</b> for what&#x2019;s checked.
  Defaults to false. If not set, the value of <b>transfer.fsckObjects</b> is
  used instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Acts like <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b>, but is used by
  <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) instead of <b>git-fsck</b>(1). See the
  <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b> documentation for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.fsck.skipList</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Acts like <b>fsck.skipList</b>, but is used by
  <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1) instead of <b>git-fsck</b>(1). See the
  <b>fsck.skipList</b> documentation for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.keepAlive</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">After receiving the pack from the client,
  <b>receive-pack</b> may produce no output (if <b>--quiet</b> was specified)
  while processing the pack, causing some networks to drop the TCP connection.
  With this option set, if <b>receive-pack</b> does not transmit any data in
  this phase for <b>receive.keepAlive</b> seconds, it will send a short
  keepalive packet. The default is 5 seconds; set to 0 to disable keepalives
  entirely.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.unpackLimit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If the number of objects received in a push is below this
  limit then the objects will be unpacked into loose object files. However if
  the number of received objects equals or exceeds this limit then the received
  pack will be stored as a pack, after adding any missing delta bases. Storing
  the pack from a push can make the push operation complete faster, especially
  on slow filesystems. If not set, the value of <b>transfer.unpackLimit</b> is
  used instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.maxInputSize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If the size of the incoming pack stream is larger than
  this limit, then git-receive-pack will error out, instead of accepting the
  pack file. If not set or set to 0, then the size is unlimited.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.denyDeletes</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update
  that deletes the ref. Use this to prevent such a ref deletion via a
  push.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.denyDeleteCurrent</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update
  that deletes the currently checked out branch of a non-bare repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.denyCurrentBranch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true or &quot;refuse&quot;, git-receive-pack
  will deny a ref update to the currently checked out branch of a non-bare
  repository. Such a push is potentially dangerous because it brings the HEAD
  out of sync with the index and working tree. If set to &quot;warn&quot;, print
  a warning of such a push to stderr, but allow the push to proceed. If set to
  false or &quot;ignore&quot;, allow such pushes with no message. Defaults to
  &quot;refuse&quot;.
<p class="Pp">Another option is &quot;updateInstead&quot; which will update the
    working tree if pushing into the current branch. This option is intended for
    synchronizing working directories when one side is not easily accessible via
    interactive ssh (e.g. a live web site, hence the requirement that the
    working directory be clean). This mode also comes in handy when developing
    inside a VM to test and fix code on different Operating Systems.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, &quot;updateInstead&quot; will refuse the push if the
    working tree or the index have any difference from the HEAD, but the
    <b>push-to-checkout</b> hook can be used to customize this. See
    <b>githooks</b>(5).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.denyNonFastForwards</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, git-receive-pack will deny a ref update
  which is not a fast-forward. Use this to prevent such an update via a push,
  even if that push is forced. This configuration variable is set when
  initializing a shared repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.hideRefs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This variable is the same as <b>transfer.hideRefs</b>,
  but applies only to <b>receive-pack</b> (and so affects pushes, but not
  fetches). An attempt to update or delete a hidden ref by <b>git push</b> is
  rejected.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.procReceiveRefs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is a multi-valued variable that defines reference
  prefixes to match the commands in <b>receive-pack</b>. Commands matching the
  prefixes will be executed by an external hook &quot;proc-receive&quot;,
  instead of the internal <b>execute_commands</b> function. If this variable is
  not defined, the &quot;proc-receive&quot; hook will never be used, and all
  commands will be executed by the internal <b>execute_commands</b> function.
<p class="Pp">For example, if this variable is set to &quot;refs/for&quot;,
    pushing to reference such as &quot;refs/for/master&quot; will not create or
    update a reference named &quot;refs/for/master&quot;, but may create or
    update a pull request directly by running the hook
  &quot;proc-receive&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Optional modifiers can be provided in the beginning of the value
    to filter commands for specific actions: create (a), modify (m), delete (d).
    A <b>!</b> can be included in the modifiers to negate the reference prefix
    entry. E.g.:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>
git config --system --add receive.procReceiveRefs ad:refs/heads
git config --system --add receive.procReceiveRefs !:refs/heads
</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.updateServerInfo</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, git-receive-pack will run
  git-update-server-info after receiving data from git-push and updating
  refs.</div>
<p class="Pp">receive.shallowUpdate</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, .git/shallow can be updated when new refs
  require new shallow roots. Otherwise those refs are rejected.</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.pushDefault</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The remote to push to by default. Overrides
  <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote</b> for all branches, and is overridden by
  <b>branch.&lt;name&gt;.pushRemote</b> for specific branches.</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.url</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The URL of a remote repository. See <b>git-fetch</b>(1)
  or <b>git-push</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.pushurl</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The push URL of a remote repository. See
  <b>git-push</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxy</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For remotes that require curl (http, https and ftp), the
  URL to the proxy to use for that remote. Set to the empty string to disable
  proxying for that remote.</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxyAuthMethod</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For remotes that require curl (http, https and ftp), the
  method to use for authenticating against the proxy in use (probably set in
  <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.proxy</b>). See <b>http.proxyAuthMethod</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.fetch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default set of &quot;refspec&quot; for
  <b>git-fetch</b>(1). See <b>git-fetch</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.push</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default set of &quot;refspec&quot; for
  <b>git-push</b>(1). See <b>git-push</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.mirror</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, pushing to this remote will automatically behave
  as if the <b>--mirror</b> option was given on the command line.</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.skipDefaultUpdate</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, this remote will be skipped by default when
  updating using <b>git-fetch</b>(1) or the <b>update</b> subcommand of
  <b>git-remote</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.skipFetchAll</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, this remote will be skipped by default when
  updating using <b>git-fetch</b>(1) or the <b>update</b> subcommand of
  <b>git-remote</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.receivepack</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default program to execute on the remote side when
  pushing. See option --receive-pack of <b>git-push</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.uploadpack</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default program to execute on the remote side when
  fetching. See option --upload-pack of <b>git-fetch-pack</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.tagOpt</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Setting this value to --no-tags disables automatic tag
  following when fetching from remote &lt;name&gt;. Setting it to --tags will
  fetch every tag from remote &lt;name&gt;, even if they are not reachable from
  remote branch heads. Passing these flags directly to <b>git-fetch</b>(1) can
  override this setting. See options --tags and --no-tags of
  <b>git-fetch</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.vcs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Setting this to a value &lt;vcs&gt; will cause Git to
  interact with the remote with the git-remote-&lt;vcs&gt; helper.</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.prune</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When set to true, fetching from this remote by default
  will also remove any remote-tracking references that no longer exist on the
  remote (as if the <b>--prune</b> option was given on the command line).
  Overrides <b>fetch.prune</b> settings, if any.</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.pruneTags</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When set to true, fetching from this remote by default
  will also remove any local tags that no longer exist on the remote if pruning
  is activated in general via <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.prune</b>,
  <b>fetch.prune</b> or <b>--prune</b>. Overrides <b>fetch.pruneTags</b>
  settings, if any.
<p class="Pp">See also <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.prune</b> and the PRUNING section
    of <b>git-fetch</b>(1).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.promisor</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When set to true, this remote will be used to fetch
  promisor objects.</div>
<p class="Pp">remote.&lt;name&gt;.partialclonefilter</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The filter that will be applied when fetching from this
  promisor remote. Changing or clearing this value will only affect fetches for
  new commits. To fetch associated objects for commits already present in the
  local object database, use the <b>--refetch</b> option of
  <b>git-fetch</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">remotes.&lt;group&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The list of remotes which are fetched by &quot;git remote
  update &lt;group&gt;&quot;. See <b>git-remote</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">repack.useDeltaBaseOffset</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, <b>git-repack</b>(1) creates packs that use
  delta-base offset. If you need to share your repository with Git older than
  version 1.4.4, either directly or via a dumb protocol such as http, then you
  need to set this option to &quot;false&quot; and repack. Access from old Git
  versions over the native protocol are unaffected by this option.</div>
<p class="Pp">repack.packKeptObjects</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, makes <b>git repack</b> act as if
  <b>--pack-kept-objects</b> was passed. See <b>git-repack</b>(1) for details.
  Defaults to <b>false</b> normally, but <b>true</b> if a bitmap index is being
  written (either via <b>--write-bitmap-index</b> or
  <b>repack.writeBitmaps</b>).</div>
<p class="Pp">repack.useDeltaIslands</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, makes <b>git repack</b> act as if
  <b>--delta-islands</b> was passed. Defaults to <b>false</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">repack.writeBitmaps</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When true, git will write a bitmap index when packing all
  objects to disk (e.g., when <b>git repack -a</b> is run). This index can speed
  up the &quot;counting objects&quot; phase of subsequent packs created for
  clones and fetches, at the cost of some disk space and extra time spent on the
  initial repack. This has no effect if multiple packfiles are created. Defaults
  to true on bare repos, false otherwise.</div>
<p class="Pp">repack.updateServerInfo</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to false, <b>git-repack</b>(1) will not run
  <b>git-update-server-info</b>(1). Defaults to true. Can be overridden when
  true by the <b>-n</b> option of <b>git-repack</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">repack.cruftWindow, repack.cruftWindowMemory, repack.cruftDepth,
    repack.cruftThreads</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Parameters used by <b>git-pack-objects</b>(1) when
  generating a cruft pack and the respective parameters are not given over the
  command line. See similarly named <b>pack.*</b> configuration variables for
  defaults and meaning.</div>
<p class="Pp">rerere.autoUpdate</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When set to true, <b>git-rerere</b> updates the index
  with the resulting contents after it cleanly resolves conflicts using
  previously recorded resolution. Defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">rerere.enabled</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Activate recording of resolved conflicts, so that
  identical conflict hunks can be resolved automatically, should they be
  encountered again. By default, <b>git-rerere</b>(1) is enabled if there is an
  <b>rr-cache</b> directory under the <b>$GIT_DIR</b>, e.g. if
  &quot;rerere&quot; was previously used in the repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">revert.reference</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Setting this variable to true makes <b>git revert</b>
  behave as if the <b>--reference</b> option is given.</div>
<p class="Pp">safe.directory</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">These config entries specify Git-tracked directories that
  are considered safe even if they are owned by someone other than the current
  user. By default, Git will refuse to even parse a Git config of a repository
  owned by someone else, let alone run its hooks, and this config setting allows
  users to specify exceptions, e.g. for intentionally shared repositories (see
  the <b>--shared</b> option in <b>git-init</b>(1)).
<p class="Pp">This is a multi-valued setting, i.e. you can add more than one
    directory via <b>git config --add</b>. To reset the list of safe directories
    (e.g. to override any such directories specified in the system config), add
    a <b>safe.directory</b> entry with an empty value.</p>
<p class="Pp">This config setting is only respected when specified in a system
    or global config, not when it is specified in a repository config, via the
    command line option <b>-c safe.directory=&lt;path&gt;</b>, or in environment
    variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of this setting is interpolated, i.e.
    <b>~/&lt;path&gt;</b> expands to a path relative to the home directory and
    <b>%(prefix)/&lt;path&gt;</b> expands to a path relative to Git&#x2019;s
    (runtime) prefix.</p>
<p class="Pp">To completely opt-out of this security check, set
    <b>safe.directory</b> to the string <b>*</b>. This will allow all
    repositories to be treated as if their directory was listed in the
    <b>safe.directory</b> list. If <b>safe.directory=*</b> is set in system
    config and you want to re-enable this protection, then initialize your list
    with an empty value before listing the repositories that you deem safe.</p>
<p class="Pp">As explained, Git only allows you to access repositories owned by
    yourself, i.e. the user who is running Git, by default. When Git is running
    as <i>root</i> in a non Windows platform that provides sudo, however, git
    checks the SUDO_UID environment variable that sudo creates and will allow
    access to the uid recorded as its value in addition to the id from
    <i>root</i>. This is to make it easy to perform a common sequence during
    installation &quot;make &amp;&amp; sudo make install&quot;. A git process
    running under <i>sudo</i> runs as <i>root</i> but the <i>sudo</i> command
    exports the environment variable to record which id the original user has.
    If that is not what you would prefer and want git to only trust repositories
    that are owned by root instead, then you can remove the <b>SUDO_UID</b>
    variable from root&#x2019;s environment before invoking git.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">sendemail.identity</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A configuration identity. When given, causes values in
  the <i>sendemail.&lt;identity&gt;</i> subsection to take precedence over
  values in the <i>sendemail</i> section. The default identity is the value of
  <b>sendemail.identity</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">sendemail.smtpEncryption</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">See <b>git-send-email</b>(1) for description. Note that
  this setting is not subject to the <i>identity</i> mechanism.</div>
<p class="Pp">sendemail.smtpsslcertpath</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Path to ca-certificates (either a directory or a single

<p class="Pp">sendemail.&lt;identity&gt;.*</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Identity-specific versions of the <i>sendemail.*</i>

<p class="Pp">sendemail.smtpBatchSize</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Number of messages to be sent per connection, after that
  a relogin will happen. If the value is 0 or undefined, send all messages in
  one connection. See also the <b>--batch-size</b> option of
  <b>git-send-email</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">sendemail.smtpReloginDelay</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Seconds wait before reconnecting to smtp server. See also
  the <b>--relogin-delay</b> option of <b>git-send-email</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">sendemail.forbidSendmailVariables</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">To avoid common misconfiguration mistakes,
  <b>git-send-email</b>(1) will abort with a warning if any configuration
  options for &quot;sendmail&quot; exist. Set this variable to bypass the
  check.</div>
<p class="Pp">sequence.editor</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Text editor used by <b>git rebase -i</b> for editing the
  rebase instruction file. The value is meant to be interpreted by the shell
  when it is used. It can be overridden by the <b>GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR</b>
  environment variable. When not configured the default commit message editor is
  used instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">showBranch.default</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The default set of branches for
  <b>git-show-branch</b>(1). See <b>git-show-branch</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">sparse.expectFilesOutsideOfPatterns</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Typically with sparse checkouts, files not matching any
  sparsity patterns are marked with a SKIP_WORKTREE bit in the index and are
  missing from the working tree. Accordingly, Git will ordinarily check whether
  files with the SKIP_WORKTREE bit are in fact present in the working tree
  contrary to expectations. If Git finds any, it marks those paths as present by
  clearing the relevant SKIP_WORKTREE bits. This option can be used to tell Git
  that such present-despite-skipped files are expected and to stop checking for
  them.
<p class="Pp">The default is <b>false</b>, which allows Git to automatically
    recover from the list of files in the index and working tree falling out of
    sync.</p>
<p class="Pp">Set this to <b>true</b> if you are in a setup where some external
    factor relieves Git of the responsibility for maintaining the consistency
    between the presence of working tree files and sparsity patterns. For
    example, if you have a Git-aware virtual file system that has a robust
    mechanism for keeping the working tree and the sparsity patterns up to date
    based on access patterns.</p>
<p class="Pp">Regardless of this setting, Git does not check for
    present-despite-skipped files unless sparse checkout is enabled, so this
    config option has no effect unless <b>core.sparseCheckout</b> is
    <b>true</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">splitIndex.maxPercentChange</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When the split index feature is used, this specifies the
  percent of entries the split index can contain compared to the total number of
  entries in both the split index and the shared index before a new shared index
  is written. The value should be between 0 and 100. If the value is 0 then a
  new shared index is always written, if it is 100 a new shared index is never
  written. By default the value is 20, so a new shared index is written if the
  number of entries in the split index would be greater than 20 percent of the
  total number of entries. See <b>git-update-index</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">splitIndex.sharedIndexExpire</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When the split index feature is used, shared index files
  that were not modified since the time this variable specifies will be removed
  when a new shared index file is created. The value &quot;now&quot; expires all
  entries immediately, and &quot;never&quot; suppresses expiration altogether.
  The default value is &quot;2.weeks.ago&quot;. Note that a shared index file is
  considered modified (for the purpose of expiration) each time a new
  split-index file is either created based on it or read from it. See
  <b>git-update-index</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">ssh.variant</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, Git determines the command line arguments to
  use based on the basename of the configured SSH command (configured using the
  environment variable <b>GIT_SSH</b> or <b>GIT_SSH_COMMAND</b> or the config
  setting <b>core.sshCommand</b>). If the basename is unrecognized, Git will
  attempt to detect support of OpenSSH options by first invoking the configured
  SSH command with the <b>-G</b> (print configuration) option and will
  subsequently use OpenSSH options (if that is successful) or no options besides
  the host and remote command (if it fails).
<p class="Pp">The config variable <b>ssh.variant</b> can be set to override this
    detection. Valid values are <b>ssh</b> (to use OpenSSH options),
    <b>plink</b>, <b>putty</b>, <b>tortoiseplink</b>, <b>simple</b> (no options
    except the host and remote command). The default auto-detection can be
    explicitly requested using the value <b>auto</b>. Any other value is treated
    as <b>ssh</b>. This setting can also be overridden via the environment
    variable <b>GIT_SSH_VARIANT</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The current command-line parameters used for each variant are as
    follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>ssh</b> - [-p port] [-4] [-6] [-o option]
  [username@]host command</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>simple</b> - [username@]host command</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>plink</b> or <b>putty</b> - [-P port] [-4]
  [-6] [username@]host command</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>tortoiseplink</b> - [-P port] [-4] [-6] -batch
  [username@]host command</div>
<p class="Pp">Except for the <b>simple</b> variant, command-line parameters are
    likely to change as git gains new features.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">status.relativePaths</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, <b>git-status</b>(1) shows paths relative to
  the current directory. Setting this variable to <b>false</b> shows paths
  relative to the repository root (this was the default for Git prior to
  v1.5.4).</div>
<p class="Pp">status.short</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set to true to enable --short by default in
  <b>git-status</b>(1). The option --no-short takes precedence over this
  variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">status.branch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set to true to enable --branch by default in
  <b>git-status</b>(1). The option --no-branch takes precedence over this
  variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">status.aheadBehind</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Set to true to enable <b>--ahead-behind</b> and false to
  enable <b>--no-ahead-behind</b> by default in <b>git-status</b>(1) for
  non-porcelain status formats. Defaults to true.</div>
<p class="Pp">status.displayCommentPrefix</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, <b>git-status</b>(1) will insert a
  comment prefix before each output line (starting with <b>core.commentChar</b>,
  i.e. <b>#</b> by default). This was the behavior of <b>git-status</b>(1) in
  Git 1.8.4 and previous. Defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">status.renameLimit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The number of files to consider when performing rename
  detection in <b>git-status</b>(1) and <b>git-commit</b>(1). Defaults to the
  value of diff.renameLimit.</div>
<p class="Pp">status.renames</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether and how Git detects renames in
  <b>git-status</b>(1) and <b>git-commit</b>(1) . If set to &quot;false&quot;,
  rename detection is disabled. If set to &quot;true&quot;, basic rename
  detection is enabled. If set to &quot;copies&quot; or &quot;copy&quot;, Git
  will detect copies, as well. Defaults to the value of diff.renames.</div>
<p class="Pp">status.showStash</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If set to true, <b>git-status</b>(1) will display the
  number of entries currently stashed away. Defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">status.showUntrackedFiles</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default, <b>git-status</b>(1) and <b>git-commit</b>(1)
  show files which are not currently tracked by Git. Directories which contain
  only untracked files, are shown with the directory name only. Showing
  untracked files means that Git needs to lstat() all the files in the whole
  repository, which might be slow on some systems. So, this variable controls
  how the commands displays the untracked files. Possible values are:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>no</b> - Show no untracked files.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>normal</b> - Show untracked files and
  directories.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>all</b> - Show also individual files in
  untracked directories.</div>
<p class="Pp">If this variable is not specified, it defaults to <i>normal</i>.
    This variable can be overridden with the -u|--untracked-files option of
    <b>git-status</b>(1) and <b>git-commit</b>(1).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">status.submoduleSummary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Defaults to false. If this is set to a non zero number or
  true (identical to -1 or an unlimited number), the submodule summary will be
  enabled and a summary of commits for modified submodules will be shown (see
  --summary-limit option of <b>git-submodule</b>(1)). Please note that the
  summary output command will be suppressed for all submodules when
  <b>diff.ignoreSubmodules</b> is set to <i>all</i> or only for those submodules
  where <b>submodule.&lt;name&gt;.ignore=all</b>. The only exception to that
  rule is that status and commit will show staged submodule changes. To also
  view the summary for ignored submodules you can either use the
  --ignore-submodules=dirty command-line option or the <i>git submodule
  summary</i> command, which shows a similar output but does not honor these
  settings.</div>
<p class="Pp">stash.showIncludeUntracked</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If this is set to true, the <b>git stash show</b> command
  will show the untracked files of a stash entry. Defaults to false. See
  description of <i>show</i> command in <b>git-stash</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">stash.showPatch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If this is set to true, the <b>git stash show</b> command
  without an option will show the stash entry in patch form. Defaults to false.
  See description of <i>show</i> command in <b>git-stash</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">stash.showStat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If this is set to true, the <b>git stash show</b> command
  without an option will show diffstat of the stash entry. Defaults to true. See
  description of <i>show</i> command in <b>git-stash</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">submodule.&lt;name&gt;.url</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The URL for a submodule. This variable is copied from the
  .gitmodules file to the git config via <i>git submodule init</i>. The user can
  change the configured URL before obtaining the submodule via <i>git submodule
  update</i>. If neither submodule.&lt;name&gt;.active or submodule.active are
  set, the presence of this variable is used as a fallback to indicate whether
  the submodule is of interest to git commands. See <b>git-submodule</b>(1) and
  <b>gitmodules</b>(5) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">submodule.&lt;name&gt;.update</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The method by which a submodule is updated by <i>git
  submodule update</i>, which is the only affected command, others such as
  <i>git checkout --recurse-submodules</i> are unaffected. It exists for
  historical reasons, when <i>git submodule</i> was the only command to interact
  with submodules; settings like <b>submodule.active</b> and <b>pull.rebase</b>
  are more specific. It is populated by <b>git submodule init</b> from the
  <b>gitmodules</b>(5) file. See description of <i>update</i> command in
  <b>git-submodule</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">submodule.&lt;name&gt;.branch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The remote branch name for a submodule, used by <b>git
  submodule update --remote</b>. Set this option to override the value found in
  the <b>.gitmodules</b> file. See <b>git-submodule</b>(1) and
  <b>gitmodules</b>(5) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">submodule.&lt;name&gt;.fetchRecurseSubmodules</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option can be used to control recursive fetching of
  this submodule. It can be overridden by using the --[no-]recurse-submodules
  command-line option to &quot;git fetch&quot; and &quot;git pull&quot;. This
  setting will override that from in the <b>gitmodules</b>(5) file.</div>
<p class="Pp">submodule.&lt;name&gt;.ignore</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Defines under what circumstances &quot;git status&quot;
  and the diff family show a submodule as modified. When set to &quot;all&quot;,
  it will never be considered modified (but it will nonetheless show up in the
  output of status and commit when it has been staged), &quot;dirty&quot; will
  ignore all changes to the submodules work tree and takes only differences
  between the HEAD of the submodule and the commit recorded in the superproject
  into account. &quot;untracked&quot; will additionally let submodules with
  modified tracked files in their work tree show up. Using &quot;none&quot; (the
  default when this option is not set) also shows submodules that have untracked
  files in their work tree as changed. This setting overrides any setting made
  in .gitmodules for this submodule, both settings can be overridden on the
  command line by using the &quot;--ignore-submodules&quot; option. The <i>git
  submodule</i> commands are not affected by this setting.</div>
<p class="Pp">submodule.&lt;name&gt;.active</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Boolean value indicating if the submodule is of interest
  to git commands. This config option takes precedence over the submodule.active
  config option. See <b>gitsubmodules</b>(7) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">submodule.active</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A repeated field which contains a pathspec used to match
  against a submodule&#x2019;s path to determine if the submodule is of interest
  to git commands. See <b>gitsubmodules</b>(7) for details.</div>
<p class="Pp">submodule.recurse</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A boolean indicating if commands should enable the
  <b>--recurse-submodules</b> option by default. Defaults to false.
<p class="Pp">When set to true, it can be deactivated via the
    <b>--no-recurse-submodules</b> option. Note that some Git commands lacking
    this option may call some of the above commands affected by
    <b>submodule.recurse</b>; for instance <b>git remote update</b> will call
    <b>git fetch</b> but does not have a <b>--no-recurse-submodules</b> option.
    For these commands a workaround is to temporarily change the configuration
    value by using <b>git -c submodule.recurse=0</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following list shows the commands that accept
    <b>--recurse-submodules</b> and whether they are supported by this
  setting.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>checkout</b>, <b>fetch</b>, <b>grep</b>,
  <b>pull</b>, <b>push</b>, <b>read-tree</b>, <b>reset</b>, <b>restore</b> and
  <b>switch</b> are always supported.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>clone</b> and <b>ls-files</b> are not
  supported.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>branch</b> is supported only if
  <b>submodule.propagateBranches</b> is enabled</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">submodule.propagateBranches</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">[EXPERIMENTAL] A boolean that enables branching support
  when using <b>--recurse-submodules</b> or <b>submodule.recurse=true</b>.
  Enabling this will allow certain commands to accept
  <b>--recurse-submodules</b> and certain commands that already accept
  <b>--recurse-submodules</b> will now consider branches. Defaults to
  false.</div>
<p class="Pp">submodule.fetchJobs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies how many submodules are fetched/cloned at the
  same time. A positive integer allows up to that number of submodules fetched
  in parallel. A value of 0 will give some reasonable default. If unset, it
  defaults to 1.</div>
<p class="Pp">submodule.alternateLocation</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies how the submodules obtain alternates when
  submodules are cloned. Possible values are <b>no</b>, <b>superproject</b>. By
  default <b>no</b> is assumed, which doesn&#x2019;t add references. When the
  value is set to <b>superproject</b> the submodule to be cloned computes its
  alternates location relative to the superprojects alternate.</div>
<p class="Pp">submodule.alternateErrorStrategy</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specifies how to treat errors with the alternates for a
  submodule as computed via <b>submodule.alternateLocation</b>. Possible values
  are <b>ignore</b>, <b>info</b>, <b>die</b>. Default is <b>die</b>. Note that
  if set to <b>ignore</b> or <b>info</b>, and if there is an error with the
  computed alternate, the clone proceeds as if no alternate was specified.</div>
<p class="Pp">tag.forceSignAnnotated</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A boolean to specify whether annotated tags created
  should be GPG signed. If <b>--annotate</b> is specified on the command line,
  it takes precedence over this option.</div>
<p class="Pp">tag.sort</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This variable controls the sort ordering of tags when
  displayed by <b>git-tag</b>(1). Without the &quot;--sort=&lt;value&gt;&quot;
  option provided, the value of this variable will be used as the default.</div>
<p class="Pp">tag.gpgSign</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A boolean to specify whether all tags should be GPG
  signed. Use of this option when running in an automated script can result in a
  large number of tags being signed. It is therefore convenient to use an agent
  to avoid typing your gpg passphrase several times. Note that this option
  doesn&#x2019;t affect tag signing behavior enabled by &quot;-u
  &lt;keyid&gt;&quot; or &quot;--local-user=&lt;keyid&gt;&quot; options.</div>
<p class="Pp">tar.umask</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This variable can be used to restrict the permission bits
  of tar archive entries. The default is 0002, which turns off the world write
  bit. The special value &quot;user&quot; indicates that the archiving
  user&#x2019;s umask will be used instead. See umask(2) and
  <b>git-archive</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp">Trace2 config settings are only read from the system and global
    config files; repository local and worktree config files and <b>-c</b>
    command line arguments are not respected.</p>
<p class="Pp">trace2.normalTarget</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This variable controls the normal target destination. It
  may be overridden by the <b>GIT_TRACE2</b> environment variable. The following
  table shows possible values.</div>
<p class="Pp">trace2.perfTarget</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This variable controls the performance target
  destination. It may be overridden by the <b>GIT_TRACE2_PERF</b> environment
  variable. The following table shows possible values.</div>
<p class="Pp">trace2.eventTarget</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This variable controls the event target destination. It
  may be overridden by the <b>GIT_TRACE2_EVENT</b> environment variable. The
  following table shows possible values.
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>0</b> or <b>false</b> - Disables the
  target.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>1</b> or <b>true</b> - Writes to
  <b>STDERR</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>[2-9]</b> - Writes to the already opened file
  descriptor.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>&lt;absolute-pathname&gt;</b> - Writes to the
  file in append mode. If the target already exists and is a directory, the
  traces will be written to files (one per process) underneath the given
  directory.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>af_unix:[&lt;socket_type&gt;:]&lt;absolute-pathname&gt;</b>
  - Write to a Unix DomainSocket (on platforms that support them). Socket type
  can be either <b>stream</b> or <b>dgram</b>; if omitted Git will try
  both.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">trace2.normalBrief</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Boolean. When true <b>time</b>, <b>filename</b>, and
  <b>line</b> fields are omitted from normal output. May be overridden by the
  <b>GIT_TRACE2_BRIEF</b> environment variable. Defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">trace2.perfBrief</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Boolean. When true <b>time</b>, <b>filename</b>, and
  <b>line</b> fields are omitted from PERF output. May be overridden by the
  <b>GIT_TRACE2_PERF_BRIEF</b> environment variable. Defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">trace2.eventBrief</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Boolean. When true <b>time</b>, <b>filename</b>, and
  <b>line</b> fields are omitted from event output. May be overridden by the
  <b>GIT_TRACE2_EVENT_BRIEF</b> environment variable. Defaults to false.</div>
<p class="Pp">trace2.eventNesting</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Integer. Specifies desired depth of nested regions in the
  event output. Regions deeper than this value will be omitted. May be
  overridden by the <b>GIT_TRACE2_EVENT_NESTING</b> environment variable.
  Defaults to 2.</div>
<p class="Pp">trace2.configParams</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A comma-separated list of patterns of
  &quot;important&quot; config settings that should be recorded in the trace2
  output. For example, <b>core.*,remote.*.url</b> would cause the trace2 output
  to contain events listing each configured remote. May be overridden by the
  <b>GIT_TRACE2_CONFIG_PARAMS</b> environment variable. Unset by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">trace2.envVars</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A comma-separated list of &quot;important&quot;
  environment variables that should be recorded in the trace2 output. For
  example, <b>GIT_HTTP_USER_AGENT,GIT_CONFIG</b> would cause the trace2 output
  to contain events listing the overrides for HTTP user agent and the location
  of the Git configuration file (assuming any are set). May be overridden by the
  <b>GIT_TRACE2_ENV_VARS</b> environment variable. Unset by default.</div>
<p class="Pp">trace2.destinationDebug</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Boolean. When true Git will print error messages when a
  trace target destination cannot be opened for writing. By default, these
  errors are suppressed and tracing is silently disabled. May be overridden by
  the <b>GIT_TRACE2_DST_DEBUG</b> environment variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">trace2.maxFiles</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Integer. When writing trace files to a target directory,
  do not write additional traces if we would exceed this many files. Instead,
  write a sentinel file that will block further tracing to this directory.
  Defaults to 0, which disables this check.</div>
<p class="Pp">transfer.credentialsInUrl</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">A configured URL can contain plaintext credentials in the
  form
  <b>&lt;protocol&gt;://&lt;user&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;/&lt;path&gt;</b>.
  You may want to warn or forbid the use of such configuration (in favor of
  using <b>git-credential</b>(1)). This will be used on <b>git-clone</b>(1),
  <b>git-fetch</b>(1), <b>git-push</b>(1), and any other direct use of the
  configured URL.
<p class="Pp">Note that this is currently limited to detecting credentials in
    <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.url</b> configuration, it won&#x2019;t detect
    credentials in <b>remote.&lt;name&gt;.pushurl</b> configuration.</p>
<p class="Pp">You might want to enable this to prevent inadvertent credentials
    exposure, e.g. because:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The OS or system where you&#x2019;re running git
  may not provide way way or otherwise allow you to configure the permissions of
  the configuration file where the username and/or password are stored.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Even if it does, having such data stored &quot;at
  rest&quot; might expose you in other ways, e.g. a backup process might copy
  the data to another system.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The git programs will pass the full URL to one
  another as arguments on the command-line, meaning the credentials will be
  exposed to other users on OS&#x2019;s or systems that allow other users to see
  the full process list of other users. On linux the &quot;hidepid&quot; setting
  documented in procfs(5) allows for configuring this behavior.
<p class="Pp">If such concerns don&#x2019;t apply to you then you probably
    don&#x2019;t need to be concerned about credentials exposure due to storing
    that sensitive data in git&#x2019;s configuration files. If you do want to
    use this, set <b>transfer.credentialsInUrl</b> to one of these values:</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>allow</b> (default): Git will proceed with its
  activity without warning.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>warn</b>: Git will write a warning message to
  <b>stderr</b> when parsing a URL with a plaintext credential.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<b>die</b>: Git will write a failure message to
  <b>stderr</b> when parsing a URL with a plaintext credential.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">transfer.fsckObjects</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <b>fetch.fsckObjects</b> or
  <b>receive.fsckObjects</b> are not set, the value of this variable is used
  instead. Defaults to false.
<p class="Pp">When set, the fetch or receive will abort in the case of a
    malformed object or a link to a nonexistent object. In addition, various
    other issues are checked for, including legacy issues (see
    <b>fsck.&lt;msg-id&gt;</b>), and potential security issues like the
    existence of a <b>.GIT</b> directory or a malicious <b>.gitmodules</b> file
    (see the release notes for v2.2.1 and v2.17.1 for details). Other sanity and
    security checks may be added in future releases.</p>
<p class="Pp">On the receiving side, failing fsckObjects will make those objects
    unreachable, see &quot;QUARANTINE ENVIRONMENT&quot; in
    <b>git-receive-pack</b>(1). On the fetch side, malformed objects will
    instead be left unreferenced in the repository.</p>
<p class="Pp">Due to the non-quarantine nature of the <b>fetch.fsckObjects</b>
    implementation it cannot be relied upon to leave the object store clean like
    <b>receive.fsckObjects</b> can.</p>
<p class="Pp">As objects are unpacked they&#x2019;re written to the object
    store, so there can be cases where malicious objects get introduced even
    though the &quot;fetch&quot; failed, only to have a subsequent
    &quot;fetch&quot; succeed because only new incoming objects are checked, not
    those that have already been written to the object store. That difference in
    behavior should not be relied upon. In the future, such objects may be
    quarantined for &quot;fetch&quot; as well.</p>
<p class="Pp">For now, the paranoid need to find some way to emulate the
    quarantine environment if they&#x2019;d like the same protection as
    &quot;push&quot;. E.g. in the case of an internal mirror do the mirroring in
    two steps, one to fetch the untrusted objects, and then do a second
    &quot;push&quot; (which will use the quarantine) to another internal repo,
    and have internal clients consume this pushed-to repository, or embargo
    internal fetches and only allow them once a full &quot;fsck&quot; has run
    (and no new fetches have happened in the meantime).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">transfer.hideRefs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">String(s) <b>receive-pack</b> and <b>upload-pack</b> use
  to decide which refs to omit from their initial advertisements. Use more than
  one definition to specify multiple prefix strings. A ref that is under the
  hierarchies listed in the value of this variable is excluded, and is hidden
  when responding to <b>git push</b> or <b>git fetch</b>. See
  <b>receive.hideRefs</b> and <b>uploadpack.hideRefs</b> for program-specific
  versions of this config.
<p class="Pp">You may also include a <b>!</b> in front of the ref name to negate
    the entry, explicitly exposing it, even if an earlier entry marked it as
    hidden. If you have multiple hideRefs values, later entries override earlier
    ones (and entries in more-specific config files override less-specific
    ones).</p>
<p class="Pp">If a namespace is in use, the namespace prefix is stripped from
    each reference before it is matched against <b>transfer.hiderefs</b>
    patterns. In order to match refs before stripping, add a <b>^</b> in front
    of the ref name. If you combine <b>!</b> and <b>^</b>, <b>!</b> must be
    specified first.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, if <b>refs/heads/master</b> is specified in
    <b>transfer.hideRefs</b> and the current namespace is <b>foo</b>, then
    <b>refs/namespaces/foo/refs/heads/master</b> is omitted from the
    advertisements. If <b>uploadpack.allowRefInWant</b> is set,
    <b>upload-pack</b> will treat <b>want-ref refs/heads/master</b> in a
    protocol v2 <b>fetch</b> command as if
    <b>refs/namespaces/foo/refs/heads/master</b> did not exist.
    <b>receive-pack</b>, on the other hand, will still advertise the object id
    the ref is pointing to without mentioning its name (a so-called
    &quot;.have&quot; line).</p>
<p class="Pp">Even if you hide refs, a client may still be able to steal the
    target objects via the techniques described in the &quot;SECURITY&quot;
    section of the <b>gitnamespaces</b>(7) man page; it&#x2019;s best to keep
    private data in a separate repository.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">transfer.unpackLimit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <b>fetch.unpackLimit</b> or
  <b>receive.unpackLimit</b> are not set, the value of this variable is used
  instead. The default value is 100.</div>
<p class="Pp">transfer.advertiseSID</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Boolean. When true, client and server processes will
  advertise their unique session IDs to their remote counterpart. Defaults to
  false.</div>
<p class="Pp">uploadarchive.allowUnreachable</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If true, allow clients to use <b>git archive --remote</b>
  to request any tree, whether reachable from the ref tips or not. See the
  discussion in the &quot;SECURITY&quot; section of <b>git-upload-archive</b>(1)
  for more details. Defaults to <b>false</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">uploadpack.hideRefs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This variable is the same as <b>transfer.hideRefs</b>,
  but applies only to <b>upload-pack</b> (and so affects only fetches, not
  pushes). An attempt to fetch a hidden ref by <b>git fetch</b> will fail. See
  also <b>uploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">uploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <b>uploadpack.hideRefs</b> is in effect, allow
  <b>upload-pack</b> to accept a fetch request that asks for an object at the
  tip of a hidden ref (by default, such a request is rejected). See also
  <b>uploadpack.hideRefs</b>. Even if this is false, a client may be able to
  steal objects via the techniques described in the &quot;SECURITY&quot; section
  of the <b>gitnamespaces</b>(7) man page; it&#x2019;s best to keep private data
  in a separate repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">uploadpack.allowReachableSHA1InWant</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow <b>upload-pack</b> to accept a fetch request that
  asks for an object that is reachable from any ref tip. However, note that
  calculating object reachability is computationally expensive. Defaults to
  <b>false</b>. Even if this is false, a client may be able to steal objects via
  the techniques described in the &quot;SECURITY&quot; section of the
  <b>gitnamespaces</b>(7) man page; it&#x2019;s best to keep private data in a
  separate repository.</div>
<p class="Pp">uploadpack.allowAnySHA1InWant</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow <b>upload-pack</b> to accept a fetch request that
  asks for any object at all. Defaults to <b>false</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">uploadpack.keepAlive</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <b>upload-pack</b> has started <b>pack-objects</b>,
  there may be a quiet period while <b>pack-objects</b> prepares the pack.
  Normally it would output progress information, but if <b>--quiet</b> was used
  for the fetch, <b>pack-objects</b> will output nothing at all until the pack
  data begins. Some clients and networks may consider the server to be hung and
  give up. Setting this option instructs <b>upload-pack</b> to send an empty
  keepalive packet every <b>uploadpack.keepAlive</b> seconds. Setting this
  option to 0 disables keepalive packets entirely. The default is 5
  seconds.</div>
<p class="Pp">uploadpack.packObjectsHook</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If this option is set, when <b>upload-pack</b> would run
  <b>git pack-objects</b> to create a packfile for a client, it will run this
  shell command instead. The <b>pack-objects</b> command and arguments it
  <i>would</i> have run (including the <b>git pack-objects</b> at the beginning)
  are appended to the shell command. The stdin and stdout of the hook are
  treated as if <b>pack-objects</b> itself was run. I.e., <b>upload-pack</b>
  will feed input intended for <b>pack-objects</b> to the hook, and expects a
  completed packfile on stdout.
<p class="Pp">Note that this configuration variable is ignored if it is seen in
    the repository-level config (this is a safety measure against fetching from
    untrusted repositories).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">uploadpack.allowFilter</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If this option is set, <b>upload-pack</b> will support
  partial clone and partial fetch object filtering.</div>
<p class="Pp">uploadpackfilter.allow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Provides a default value for unspecified object filters
  (see: the below configuration variable). If set to <b>true</b>, this will also
  enable all filters which get added in the future. Defaults to
  <b>true</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">uploadpackfilter.&lt;filter&gt;.allow</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Explicitly allow or ban the object filter corresponding
  to <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b>, where <b>&lt;filter&gt;</b> may be one of:
  <b>blob:none</b>, <b>blob:limit</b>, <b>object:type</b>, <b>tree</b>,
  <b>sparse:oid</b>, or <b>combine</b>. If using combined filters, both
  <b>combine</b> and all of the nested filter kinds must be allowed. Defaults to
  <b>uploadpackfilter.allow</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">uploadpackfilter.tree.maxDepth</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Only allow <b>--filter=tree:&lt;n&gt;</b> when
  <b>&lt;n&gt;</b> is no more than the value of
  <b>uploadpackfilter.tree.maxDepth</b>. If set, this also implies
  <b>uploadpackfilter.tree.allow=true</b>, unless this configuration variable
  had already been set. Has no effect if unset.</div>
<p class="Pp">uploadpack.allowRefInWant</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If this option is set, <b>upload-pack</b> will support
  the <b>ref-in-want</b> feature of the protocol version 2 <b>fetch</b> command.
  This feature is intended for the benefit of load-balanced servers which may
  not have the same view of what OIDs their refs point to due to replication
  delay.</div>
<p class="Pp">url.&lt;base&gt;.insteadOf</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Any URL that starts with this value will be rewritten to
  start, instead, with &lt;base&gt;. In cases where some site serves a large
  number of repositories, and serves them with multiple access methods, and some
  users need to use different access methods, this feature allows people to
  specify any of the equivalent URLs and have Git automatically rewrite the URL
  to the best alternative for the particular user, even for a never-before-seen
  repository on the site. When more than one insteadOf strings match a given
  URL, the longest match is used.
<p class="Pp">Note that any protocol restrictions will be applied to the
    rewritten URL. If the rewrite changes the URL to use a custom protocol or
    remote helper, you may need to adjust the <b>protocol.*.allow</b> config to
    permit the request. In particular, protocols you expect to use for
    submodules must be set to <b>always</b> rather than the default of
    <b>user</b>. See the description of <b>protocol.allow</b> above.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">url.&lt;base&gt;.pushInsteadOf</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Any URL that starts with this value will not be pushed
  to; instead, it will be rewritten to start with &lt;base&gt;, and the
  resulting URL will be pushed to. In cases where some site serves a large
  number of repositories, and serves them with multiple access methods, some of
  which do not allow push, this feature allows people to specify a pull-only URL
  and have Git automatically use an appropriate URL to push, even for a
  never-before-seen repository on the site. When more than one pushInsteadOf
  strings match a given URL, the longest match is used. If a remote has an
  explicit pushurl, Git will ignore this setting for that remote.</div>
<p class="Pp">user.name, user.email, author.name, author.email, committer.name,
    committer.email</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>user.name</b> and <b>user.email</b> variables
  determine what ends up in the <b>author</b> and <b>committer</b> field of
  commit objects. If you need the <b>author</b> or <b>committer</b> to be
  different, the <b>author.name</b>, <b>author.email</b>, <b>committer.name</b>
  or <b>committer.email</b> variables can be set. Also, all of these can be
  overridden by the <b>GIT_AUTHOR_NAME</b>, <b>GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL</b>,
  <b>GIT_COMMITTER_NAME</b>, <b>GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL</b> and <b>EMAIL</b>
  environment variables.
<p class="Pp">Note that the <b>name</b> forms of these variables conventionally
    refer to some form of a personal name. See <b>git-commit</b>(1) and the
    environment variables section of <b>git</b>(1) for more information on these
    settings and the <b>credential.username</b> option if you&#x2019;re looking
    for authentication credentials instead.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">user.useConfigOnly</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instruct Git to avoid trying to guess defaults for
  <b>user.email</b> and <b>user.name</b>, and instead retrieve the values only
  from the configuration. For example, if you have multiple email addresses and
  would like to use a different one for each repository, then with this
  configuration option set to <b>true</b> in the global config along with a
  name, Git will prompt you to set up an email before making new commits in a
  newly cloned repository. Defaults to <b>false</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">user.signingKey</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If <b>git-tag</b>(1) or <b>git-commit</b>(1) is not
  selecting the key you want it to automatically when creating a signed tag or
  commit, you can override the default selection with this variable. This option
  is passed unchanged to gpg&#x2019;s --local-user parameter, so you may specify
  a key using any method that gpg supports. If gpg.format is set to <b>ssh</b>
  this can contain the path to either your private ssh key or the public key
  when ssh-agent is used. Alternatively it can contain a public key prefixed
  with <b>key::</b> directly (e.g.: &quot;key::ssh-rsa XXXXXX identifier&quot;).
  The private key needs to be available via ssh-agent. If not set git will call
  gpg.ssh.defaultKeyCommand (e.g.: &quot;ssh-add -L&quot;) and try to use the
  first key available. For backward compatibility, a raw key which begins with
  &quot;ssh-&quot;, such as &quot;ssh-rsa XXXXXX identifier&quot;, is treated as
  &quot;key::ssh-rsa XXXXXX identifier&quot;, but this form is deprecated; use
  the <b>key::</b> form instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">versionsort.prereleaseSuffix (deprecated)</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Deprecated alias for <b>versionsort.suffix</b>. Ignored
  if <b>versionsort.suffix</b> is set.</div>
<p class="Pp">versionsort.suffix</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Even when version sort is used in <b>git-tag</b>(1),
  tagnames with the same base version but different suffixes are still sorted
  lexicographically, resulting e.g. in prerelease tags appearing after the main
  release (e.g. &quot;1.0-rc1&quot; after &quot;1.0&quot;). This variable can be
  specified to determine the sorting order of tags with different suffixes.
<p class="Pp">By specifying a single suffix in this variable, any tagname
    containing that suffix will appear before the corresponding main release.
    E.g. if the variable is set to &quot;-rc&quot;, then all &quot;1.0-rcX&quot;
    tags will appear before &quot;1.0&quot;. If specified multiple times, once
    per suffix, then the order of suffixes in the configuration will determine
    the sorting order of tagnames with those suffixes. E.g. if &quot;-pre&quot;
    appears before &quot;-rc&quot; in the configuration, then all
    &quot;1.0-preX&quot; tags will be listed before any &quot;1.0-rcX&quot;
    tags. The placement of the main release tag relative to tags with various
    suffixes can be determined by specifying the empty suffix among those other
    suffixes. E.g. if the suffixes &quot;-rc&quot;, &quot;&quot;,
    &quot;-ck&quot; and &quot;-bfs&quot; appear in the configuration in this
    order, then all &quot;v4.8-rcX&quot; tags are listed first, followed by
    &quot;v4.8&quot;, then &quot;v4.8-ckX&quot; and finally
    &quot;v4.8-bfsX&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">If more than one suffixes match the same tagname, then that
    tagname will be sorted according to the suffix which starts at the earliest
    position in the tagname. If more than one different matching suffixes start
    at that earliest position, then that tagname will be sorted according to the
    longest of those suffixes. The sorting order between different suffixes is
    undefined if they are in multiple config files.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">web.browser</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify a web browser that may be used by some commands.
  Currently only <b>git-instaweb</b>(1) and <b>git-help</b>(1) may use it.</div>
<p class="Pp">worktree.guessRemote</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If no branch is specified and neither <b>-b</b> nor
  <b>-B</b> nor <b>--detach</b> is used, then <b>git worktree add</b> defaults
  to creating a new branch from HEAD. If <b>worktree.guessRemote</b> is set to
  true, <b>worktree add</b> tries to find a remote-tracking branch whose name
  uniquely matches the new branch name. If such a branch exists, it is checked
  out and set as &quot;upstream&quot; for the new branch. If no such match can
  be found, it falls back to creating a new branch from the current HEAD.</div>
