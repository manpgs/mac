<p class="Pp">Zsh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) usable as an interactive
    login shell and as a shell script command processor. Of the standard shells,
    zsh most closely resembles <b>ksh</b> but includes many enhancements. It
    does not provide compatibility with POSIX or other shells in its default
    operating mode: see the section `Compatibility' below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Zsh has command line editing, builtin spelling correction,
    programmable command completion, shell functions (with autoloading), a
    history mechanism, and a host of other features.</p>

<p class="Pp">The following flags are interpreted by the shell when invoked to
    determine where the shell will read commands from:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-c</b></dt>
  <dd>Take the first argument as a command to execute, rather than reading
      commands from a script or standard input. If any further arguments are
      given, the first one is assigned to <b>$0</b>, rather than being used as a
      positional parameter.</dd>
  <dt id="i"><a class="permalink" href="#i"><b>-i</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Force shell to be interactive. It is still possible to specify a script to
      execute.</dd>
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><b>-s</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Force shell to read commands from the standard input. If the <b>-s</b>
      flag is not present and an argument is given, the first argument is taken
      to be the pathname of a script to execute.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If there are any remaining arguments after option processing, and
    neither of the options <b>-c</b> or <b>-s</b> was supplied, the first
    argument is taken as the file name of a script containing shell commands to
    be executed. If the option <b>PATH_SCRIPT</b> is set, and the file name does
    not contain a directory path (i.e. there is no `<b>/</b>' in the name),
    first the current directory and then the command path given by the variable
    <b>PATH</b> are searched for the script. If the option is not set or the
    file name contains a `<b>/</b>' it is used directly.</p>
<p class="Pp">After the first one or two arguments have been appropriated as
    described above, the remaining arguments are assigned to the positional
    parameters.</p>
<p class="Pp">For further options, which are common to invocation and the
    <b>set</b> builtin, see <i>zshoptions</i>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">The long option `<b>-</b><b>-emulate</b>' followed (in a separate
    word) by an emulation mode may be passed to the shell. The emulation modes
    are those described for the <b>emulate</b> builtin, see
    <i>zshbuiltins</i>(1). The `<b>-</b><b>-emulate</b>' option must precede any
    other options (which might otherwise be overridden), but following options
    are honoured, so may be used to modify the requested emulation mode. Note
    that certain extra steps are taken to ensure a smooth emulation when this
    option is used compared with the <b>emulate</b> command within the shell:
    for example, variables that conflict with POSIX usage such as <b>path</b>
    are not defined within the shell.</p>
<p class="Pp">Options may be specified by name using the <b>-o</b> option.
    <b>-o</b> acts like a single-letter option, but takes a following string as
    the option name. For example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre><b>zsh -x -o shwordsplit scr</b></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">runs the script <b>scr</b>, setting the <b>XTRACE</b> option by
    the corresponding letter `<b>-x</b>' and the <b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b> option by
    name. Options may be turned <i>off</i> by name by using <b>+o</b> instead of
    <b>-o</b>. <b>-o</b> can be stacked up with preceding single-letter options,
    so for example `<b>-xo shwordsplit</b>' or `<b>-xoshwordsplit</b>' is
    equivalent to `<b>-x -o shwordsplit</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">Options may also be specified by name in GNU long option style,
    `<b>-</b><b>-</b><i>option-name</i>'. When this is done, `<b>-</b>'
    characters in the option name are permitted: they are translated into
    `<b>_</b>', and thus ignored. So, for example, `<b>zsh
    -</b><b>-sh-word-split</b>' invokes zsh with the <b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b> option
    turned on. Like other option syntaxes, options can be turned off by
    replacing the initial `<b>-</b>' with a `<b>+</b>'; thus
    `<b>+-sh-word-split</b>' is equivalent to
    `<b>-</b><b>-no-sh-word-split</b>'. Unlike other option syntaxes, GNU-style
    long options cannot be stacked with any other options, so for example
    `<b>-x-shwordsplit</b>' is an error, rather than being treated like `<b>-x
    -</b><b>-shwordsplit</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">The special GNU-style option `<b>-</b><b>-version</b>' is handled;
    it sends to standard output the shell's version information, then exits
    successfully. `<b>-</b><b>-help</b>' is also handled; it sends to standard
    output a list of options that can be used when invoking the shell, then
    exits successfully.</p>
<p class="Pp">Option processing may be finished, allowing following arguments
    that start with `<b>-</b>' or `<b>+</b>' to be treated as normal arguments,
    in two ways. Firstly, a lone `<b>-</b>' (or `<b>+</b>') as an argument by
    itself ends option processing. Secondly, a special option `<b>-</b><b>-</b>'
    (or `<b>+-</b>'), which may be specified on its own (which is the standard
    POSIX usage) or may be stacked with preceding options (so `<b>-x-</b>' is
    equivalent to `<b>-x -</b><b>-</b>'). Options are not permitted to be
    stacked after `<b>-</b><b>-</b>' (so `<b>-x-f</b>' is an error), but note
    the GNU-style option form discussed above, where
    `<b>-</b><b>-shwordsplit</b>' is permitted and does not end option
    processing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Except when the <b>sh</b>/<b>ksh</b> emulation single-letter
    options are in effect, the option `<b>-b</b>' (or `<b>+b</b>') ends option
    processing. `<b>-b</b>' is like `<b>-</b><b>-</b>', except that further
    single-letter options can be stacked after the `<b>-b</b>' and will take
    effect as normal.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMPATIBILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#COMPATIBILITY">COMPATIBILITY</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Zsh tries to emulate <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b> when it is invoked as
    <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b> respectively; more precisely, it looks at the first
    letter of the name by which it was invoked, excluding any initial `<b>r</b>'
    (assumed to stand for `restricted'), and if that is `<b>b</b>', `<b>s</b>'
    or `<b>k</b>' it will emulate <b>sh</b> or <b>ksh</b>. Furthermore, if
    invoked as <b>su</b> (which happens on certain systems when the shell is
    executed by the <b>su</b> command), the shell will try to find an
    alternative name from the <b>SHELL</b> environment variable and perform
    emulation based on that.</p>
<p class="Pp">In <b>sh</b> and <b>ksh</b> compatibility modes the following
    parameters are not special and not initialized by the shell: <b>ARGC</b>,
    <b>argv</b>, <b>cdpath</b>, <b>fignore</b>, <b>fpath</b>, <b>HISTCHARS</b>,
    <b>mailpath</b>, <b>MANPATH</b>, <b>manpath</b>, <b>path</b>, <b>prompt</b>,
    <b>PROMPT</b>, <b>PROMPT2</b>, <b>PROMPT3</b>, <b>PROMPT4</b>, <b>psvar</b>,
    <b>status</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The usual zsh startup/shutdown scripts are not executed. Login
    shells source <b>/etc/profile</b> followed by <b>$HOME/.profile</b>. If the
    <b>ENV</b> environment variable is set on invocation, <b>$ENV</b> is sourced
    after the profile scripts. The value of <b>ENV</b> is subjected to parameter
    expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion before being
    interpreted as a pathname. Note that the <b>PRIVILEGED</b> option also
    affects the execution of startup files.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following options are set if the shell is invoked as <b>sh</b>
    or <b>ksh</b>: <b>NO_BAD_PATTERN</b>, <b>NO_BANG_HIST</b>,
    <b>NO_BG_NICE</b>, <b>NO_EQUALS</b>, <b>NO_FUNCTION_ARGZERO</b>,
    <b>GLOB_SUBST</b>, <b>NO_GLOBAL_EXPORT</b>, <b>NO_HUP</b>,
    <b>INTERACTIVE_COMMENTS</b>, <b>KSH_ARRAYS</b>, <b>NO_MULTIOS</b>,
    <b>NO_NOMATCH</b>, <b>NO_NOTIFY</b>, <b>POSIX_BUILTINS</b>,
    <b>NO_PROMPT_PERCENT</b>, <b>RM_STAR_SILENT</b>, <b>SH_FILE_EXPANSION</b>,
    <b>SH_GLOB</b>, <b>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</b>, <b>SH_WORD_SPLIT</b>. Additionally
    the <b>BSD_ECHO</b> and <b>IGNORE_BRACES</b> options are set if zsh is
    invoked as <b>sh</b>. Also, the <b>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</b>,
    <b>LOCAL_OPTIONS</b>, <b>PROMPT_BANG</b>, <b>PROMPT_SUBST</b> and
    <b>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</b> options are set if zsh is invoked as <b>ksh</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Please note that, whilst reasonable efforts are taken to address
    incompatibilities when they arise, zsh does not guarantee complete emulation
    of other shells, nor POSIX compliance. For more information on the
    differences between zsh and other shells, please refer to chapter&#x00A0;2
    of the shell FAQ, <b>https://www.zsh.org/FAQ/</b>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RESTRICTED_SHELL"><a class="permalink" href="#RESTRICTED_SHELL">RESTRICTED
  SHELL</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">When the basename of the command used to invoke zsh starts with
    the letter `<b>r</b>' or the `<b>-r</b>' command line option is supplied at
    invocation, the shell becomes restricted. Emulation mode is determined after
    stripping the letter `<b>r</b>' from the invocation name. The following are
    disabled in restricted mode:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>

  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>turning off restricted mode with <b>set +r</b> or <b>unsetopt</b>
      <b>RESTRICTED</b></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">These restrictions are enforced after processing the startup
    files. The startup files should set up <b>PATH</b> to point to a directory
    of commands which can be safely invoked in the restricted environment. They
    may also add further restrictions by disabling selected builtins.</p>
<p class="Pp">Restricted mode can also be activated any time by setting the
    <b>RESTRICTED</b> option. This immediately enables all the restrictions
    described above even if the shell still has not processed all startup
  files.</p>
<p class="Pp">A shell <i>Restricted Mode</i> is an outdated way to restrict what
    users may do: modern systems have better, safer and more reliable ways to
    confine user actions, such as <i>chroot jails</i>, <i>containers</i> and
    <i>zones</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">A restricted shell is very difficult to implement safely. The
    feature may be removed in a future version of zsh.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is important to realise that the restrictions only apply to the
    shell, not to the commands it runs (except for some shell builtins). While a
    restricted shell can only run the restricted list of commands accessible via
    the predefined `<b>PATH</b>' variable, it does not prevent those commands
    from running any other command.</p>
<p class="Pp">As an example, if `<b>env</b>' is among the list of <i>allowed</i>
    commands, then it allows the user to run any command as `<b>env</b>' is not
    a shell builtin command and can run arbitrary executables.</p>
<p class="Pp">So when implementing a restricted shell framework it is important
    to be fully aware of what actions each of the <i>allowed</i> commands or
    features (which may be regarded as <i>modules</i>) can perform.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many commands can have their behaviour affected by environment
    variables. Except for the few listed above, zsh does not restrict the
    setting of environment variables.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a `<b>perl</b>', `<b>python</b>', `<b>bash</b>', or other
    general purpose interpreted script it treated as a restricted command, the
    user can work around the restriction by setting specially crafted
    `<b>PERL5LIB</b>', `<b>PYTHONPATH</b>', `<b>BASHENV</b>' (etc.) environment
    variables. On GNU systems, any command can be made to run arbitrary code
    when performing character set conversion (including zsh itself) by setting a
    `<b>GCONV_PATH</b>' environment variable. Those are only a few examples.</p>
<p class="Pp">Bear in mind that, contrary to some other shells,
    `<b>readonly</b>' is not a security feature in zsh as it can be undone and
    so cannot be used to mitigate the above.</p>
<p class="Pp">A restricted shell only works if the allowed commands are few and
    carefully written so as not to grant more access to users than intended. It
    is also important to restrict what zsh module the user may load as some of
    them, such as `<b>zsh/system</b>', `<b>zsh/mapfile</b>' and
    `<b>zsh/files</b>', allow bypassing most of the restrictions.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="STARTUP/SHUTDOWN_FILES"><a class="permalink" href="#STARTUP/SHUTDOWN_FILES">STARTUP/SHUTDOWN
  FILES</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Commands are first read from <b>/etc/zshenv</b>; this cannot be
    overridden. Subsequent behaviour is modified by the <b>RCS</b> and
    <b>GLOBAL_RCS</b> options; the former affects all startup files, while the
    second only affects global startup files (those shown here with an path
    starting with a <b>/</b>). If one of the options is unset at any point, any
    subsequent startup file(s) of the corresponding type will not be read. It is
    also possible for a file in <b>$ZDOTDIR</b> to re-enable <b>GLOBAL_RCS</b>.
    Both <b>RCS</b> and <b>GLOBAL_RCS</b> are set by default.</p>
<p class="Pp">Commands are then read from <b>$ZDOTDIR/.zshenv</b>. If the shell
    is a login shell, commands are read from <b>/etc/zprofile</b> and then
    <b>$ZDOTDIR/.zprofile</b>. Then, if the shell is interactive, commands are
    read from <b>/etc/zshrc</b> and then <b>$ZDOTDIR/.zshrc</b>. Finally, if the
    shell is a login shell, <b>/etc/zlogin</b> and <b>$ZDOTDIR/.zlogin</b> are
    read.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a login shell exits, the files <b>$ZDOTDIR/.zlogout</b> and
    then <b>/etc/zlogout</b> are read. This happens with either an explicit exit
    via the <b>exit</b> or <b>logout</b> commands, or an implicit exit by
    reading end-of-file from the terminal. However, if the shell terminates due
    to <b>exec</b>'ing another process, the logout files are not read. These are
    also affected by the <b>RCS</b> and <b>GLOBAL_RCS</b> options. Note also
    that the <b>RCS</b> option affects the saving of history files, i.e. if
    <b>RCS</b> is unset when the shell exits, no history file will be saved.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>ZDOTDIR</b> is unset, <b>HOME</b> is used instead. Files
    listed above as being in <b>/etc</b> may be in another directory, depending
    on the installation.</p>
<p class="Pp">As <b>/etc/zshenv</b> is run for all instances of zsh, it is
    important that it be kept as small as possible. In particular, it is a good
    idea to put code that does not need to be run for every single shell behind
