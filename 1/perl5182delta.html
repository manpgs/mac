  <li>B has been upgraded from version 1.42_01 to 1.42_02.
    <p class="Pp">The fix for [perl #118525] introduced a regression in the
        behaviour of <span class="Li">&quot;B::CV::GV&quot;</span>, changing the
        return value from a <span class="Li">&quot;B::SPECIAL&quot;</span>
        object on a <span class="Li">&quot;NULL&quot;</span>

  <li>English has been upgraded from version 1.06 to 1.06_01. This fixes an

  Bug Fixes</a></h1>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Perl 5.18.1 introduced a regression along with a bugfix for lexical subs.
      Some B::SPECIAL results from B::CV::GV became undefs instead. This broke
      Devel::Cover among other libraries. This has been fixed. [perl
    #119351]</li>
  <li>Perl 5.18.0 introduced a regression whereby
      <span class="Li">&quot;[:^ascii:]&quot;</span>, if used in the same
      character class as other qualifiers, would fail to match characters in the
      Latin-1 block. This has been fixed. [perl #120799]</li>
  <li>Perl 5.18.0 introduced a regression when using -&gt;SUPER::method with
      AUTOLOAD by looking up AUTOLOAD from the current package, rather than the
      current packageXs superclass. This has been fixed. [perl #120694]</li>
  <li>Perl 5.18.0 introduced a regression whereby
      <span class="Li">&quot;-bareword&quot;</span> was no longer permitted
      under the <span class="Li">&quot;strict&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;integer&quot;</span> pragmata when used together.
      This has been fixed. [perl #120288]</li>
  <li>Previously PerlIOBase_dup didn't check if pushing the new layer succeeded
      before (optionally) setting the utf8 flag. This could cause
      segfaults-by-nullpointer. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>A buffer overflow with very long identifiers has been fixed.</li>
  <li>A regression from 5.16 in the handling of padranges led to assertion
      failures if a keyword plugin declined to handle the second XmyX, but only
      after creating a padop.
    <p class="Pp">This affected, at least, Devel::CallParser under threaded
        builds.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This has been fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The construct <span class="Li">&quot;$r=qr/.../; /$r/p&quot;</span> is now
      handled properly, an issue which had been worsened by changes 5.18.0.
      [perl #118213]</li>

<p class="Pp">Perl 5.18.2 represents approximately 3 months of development since
    Perl 5.18.1 and contains approximately 980 lines of changes across 39 files
    from 4 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.18.2:</p>
<p class="Pp">Craig A. Berry, David Mitchell, Ricardo Signes, Tony Cook.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
    please see the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Reporting_Bugs"><a class="permalink" href="#Reporting_Bugs">Reporting
  Bugs</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
    recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
    database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
    http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who will be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
    a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
