<p class="Pp">If you want to use Perl on the Hurd, I recommend using the Debian
    GNU/Hurd distribution ( see &lt;http://www.debian.org/&gt; ), even if an
    official, stable release has not yet been made. The old &quot;gnu-0.2&quot;
    binary distribution will most certainly have additional problems.</p>

  Problems with Perl on Hurd</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The Perl test suite may still report some errors on the Hurd. The
    &quot;lib/anydbm&quot; and &quot;pragma/warnings&quot; tests will almost
    certainly fail. Both failures are not really specific to the Hurd, as
    indicated by the test suite output.</p>
<p class="Pp">The socket tests may fail if the network is not configured. You
    have to make &quot;/hurd/pfinet&quot; the translator for
    &quot;/servers/socket/2&quot;, giving it the right arguments. Try
    &quot;/hurd/pfinet --help&quot; for more information.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here are the statistics for Perl 5.005_62 on my system:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre> Failed Test  Status Wstat Total Fail  Failed  List of failed
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 lib/anydbm.t                 12    1   8.33%  12
 pragma/warnings             333    1   0.30%  215
 8 tests and 24 subtests skipped.
 Failed 2/229 test scripts, 99.13% okay. 2/10850 subtests failed,
     99.98% okay.
</pre>
<p class="Pp">There are quite a few systems out there that do worse!</p>
<p class="Pp">However, since I am running a very recent Hurd snapshot, in which
    a lot of bugs that were exposed by the Perl test suite have been fixed, you
    may encounter more failures. Likely candidates are: &quot;op/stat&quot;,
    &quot;lib/io_pipe&quot;, &quot;lib/io_sock&quot;, &quot;lib/io_udp&quot; and
    &quot;lib/time&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">In any way, if you're seeing failures beyond those mentioned in
    this document, please consider upgrading to the latest Hurd before reporting
    the failure as a bug.</p>
