<p class="Pp">If the <b>ZLE</b> option is set (which it is by default in
    interactive shells) and the shell input is attached to the terminal, the
    user is able to edit command lines.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are two display modes. The first, multiline mode, is the
    default. It only works if the <b>TERM</b> parameter is set to a valid
    terminal type that can move the cursor up. The second, single line mode, is
    used if <b>TERM</b> is invalid or incapable of moving the cursor up, or if
    the <b>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</b> option is set. This mode is similar to
    <b>ksh</b>, and uses no termcap sequences. If <b>TERM</b> is
    &quot;emacs&quot;, the <b>ZLE</b> option will be unset by default.</p>
<p class="Pp">The parameters <b>BAUD</b>, <b>COLUMNS</b>, and <b>LINES</b> are
    also used by the line editor. See <i>Parameters Used By The Shell</i> in
    <i>zshparam</i>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">The parameter <b>zle_highlight</b> is also used by the line
    editor; see <i>Character Highlighting</i> below. Highlighting of special
    characters and the region between the cursor and the mark (as set with
    <b>set-mark-command</b> in Emacs mode, or by <b>visual-mode</b> in Vi mode)
    is enabled by default; consult this reference for more information.
    Irascible conservatives will wish to know that all highlighting may be
    disabled by the following setting:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre><b>zle_highlight=(none)</b></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In many places, references are made to the <b>numeric
    argument</b>. This can by default be entered in emacs mode by holding the
    alt key and typing a number, or pressing escape before each digit, and in vi
    command mode by typing the number before entering a command. Generally the
    numeric argument causes the next command entered to be repeated the
    specified number of times, unless otherwise noted below; this is implemented
    by the <b>digit-argument</b> widget. See also the <i>Arguments</i>
    subsection of the <i>Widgets</i> section for some other ways the numeric
    argument can be modified.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="KEYMAPS"><a class="permalink" href="#KEYMAPS">KEYMAPS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A keymap in ZLE contains a set of bindings between key sequences
    and ZLE commands. The empty key sequence cannot be bound.</p>
<p class="Pp">There can be any number of keymaps at any time, and each keymap
    has one or more names. If all of a keymap's names are deleted, it
    disappears. <b>bindkey</b> can be used to manipulate keymap names.</p>
<p class="Pp">Initially, there are eight keymaps:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="emacs"><a class="permalink" href="#emacs"><b>emacs</b></a></dt>
  <dd>EMACS emulation</dd>
  <dt id="viins"><a class="permalink" href="#viins"><b>viins</b></a></dt>
  <dd>vi emulation - insert mode</dd>
  <dt id="vicmd"><a class="permalink" href="#vicmd"><b>vicmd</b></a></dt>
  <dd>vi emulation - command mode</dd>
  <dt id="viopp"><a class="permalink" href="#viopp"><b>viopp</b></a></dt>
  <dd>vi emulation - operator pending</dd>
  <dt id="visual"><a class="permalink" href="#visual"><b>visual</b></a></dt>
  <dd>vi emulation - selection active</dd>
  <dt id="isearch"><a class="permalink" href="#isearch"><b>isearch</b></a></dt>
  <dd>incremental search mode</dd>
  <dt id="command"><a class="permalink" href="#command"><b>command</b></a></dt>
  <dd>read a command name</dd>
  <dt><b>.safe</b></dt>
  <dd>fallback keymap</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The `<b>.safe</b>' keymap is special. It can never be altered, and
    the name can never be removed. However, it can be linked to other names,
    which can be removed. In the future other special keymaps may be added;
    users should avoid using names beginning with `<b>.</b>' for their own
    keymaps.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to these names, either `<b>emacs</b>' or
    `<b>viins</b>' is also linked to the name `<b>main</b>'. If one of the
    <b>VISUAL</b> or <b>EDITOR</b> environment variables contain the string
    `<b>vi</b>' when the shell starts up then it will be `<b>viins</b>',
    otherwise it will be `<b>emacs</b>'. <b>bindkey</b>'s <b>-e</b> and
    <b>-v</b> options provide a convenient way to override this default
  choice.</p>
<p class="Pp">When the editor starts up, it will select the `<b>main</b>'
    keymap. If that keymap doesn't exist, it will use `<b>.safe</b>'
  instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the `<b>.safe</b>' keymap, each single key is bound to
    <b>self-insert</b>, except for ^J (line feed) and ^M (return) which are
    bound to <b>accept-line</b>. This is deliberately not pleasant to use; if
    you are using it, it means you deleted the main keymap, and you should put
    it back.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Reading_Commands"><a class="permalink" href="#Reading_Commands">Reading
  Commands</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">When ZLE is reading a command from the terminal, it may read a
    sequence that is bound to some command and is also a prefix of a longer
    bound string. In this case ZLE will wait a certain time to see if more
    characters are typed, and if not (or they don't match any longer string) it
    will execute the binding. This timeout is defined by the <b>KEYTIMEOUT</b>
    parameter; its default is 0.4 sec. There is no timeout if the prefix string
    is not itself bound to a command.</p>
<p class="Pp">The key timeout is also applied when ZLE is reading the bytes from
    a multibyte character string when it is in the appropriate mode. (This
    requires that the shell was compiled with multibyte mode enabled; typically
    also the locale has characters with the UTF-8 encoding, although any
    multibyte encoding known to the operating system is supported.) If the
    second or a subsequent byte is not read within the timeout period, the shell
    acts as if <b>?</b> were typed and resets the input state.</p>
<p class="Pp">As well as ZLE commands, key sequences can be bound to other
    strings, by using `<b>bindkey -s</b>'. When such a sequence is read, the
    replacement string is pushed back as input, and the command reading process
    starts again using these fake keystrokes. This input can itself invoke
    further replacement strings, but in order to detect loops the process will
    be stopped if there are twenty such replacements without a real command
    being read.</p>
<p class="Pp">A key sequence typed by the user can be turned into a command name
    for use in user-defined widgets with the <b>read-command</b> widget,
    described in the subsection `Miscellaneous' of the section `Standard
    Widgets' below.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Local_Keymaps"><a class="permalink" href="#Local_Keymaps">Local
  Keymaps</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">While for normal editing a single keymap is used exclusively, in
    many modes a local keymap allows for some keys to be customised. For
    example, in an incremental search mode, a binding in the <b>isearch</b>
    keymap will override a binding in the <b>main</b> keymap but all keys that
    are not overridden can still be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a key sequence is defined in a local keymap, it will hide a key
    sequence in the global keymap that is a prefix of that sequence. An example
    of this occurs with the binding of <b>iw</b> in <b>viopp</b> as this hides
    the binding of <b>i</b> in <b>vicmd</b>. However, a longer sequence in the
    global keymap that shares the same prefix can still apply so for example the
    binding of <b>^Xa</b> in the global keymap will be unaffected by the binding
    of <b>^Xb</b> in the local keymap.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ZLE_BUILTINS"><a class="permalink" href="#ZLE_BUILTINS">ZLE
  BUILTINS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The ZLE module contains three related builtin commands. The
    <b>bindkey</b> command manipulates keymaps and key bindings; the
    <b>vared</b> command invokes ZLE on the value of a shell parameter; and the
    <b>zle</b> command manipulates editing widgets and allows command line
    access to ZLE commands from within shell functions.</p>

  <dd><b>bindkey</b>'s options can be divided into three categories: keymap
      selection for the current command, operation selection, and others. The
      keymap selection options are:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-e</b></dt>
  <dd>Selects keymap `<b>emacs</b>' for any operations by the current command,
      and also links `<b>emacs</b>' to `<b>main</b>' so that it is selected by
      default the next time the editor starts.</dd>
  <dt id="v"><a class="permalink" href="#v"><b>-v</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Selects keymap `<b>viins</b>' for any operations by the current command,
      and also links `<b>viins</b>' to `<b>main</b>' so that it is selected by
      default the next time the editor starts.</dd>
  <dt id="a"><a class="permalink" href="#a"><b>-a</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Selects keymap `<b>vicmd</b>' for any operations by the current
    command.</dd>
  <dt id="M"><a class="permalink" href="#M"><b>-M</b> <i>keymap</i></a></dt>
  <dd>The <i>keymap</i> specifies a keymap name that is selected for any
      operations by the current command.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If a keymap selection is required and none of the options above
    are used, the `<b>main</b>' keymap is used. Some operations do not permit a
    keymap to be selected, namely:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-l</b></dt>
  <dd>List all existing keymap names; if any arguments are given, list just
      those keymaps.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-L</b> option is also used, list in the form of
    <b>bindkey</b> commands to create or link the keymaps. `<b>bindkey -lL</b>
    <b>main</b>' shows which keymap is linked to `<b>main</b>', if any, and
    hence if the standard emacs or vi emulation is in effect. This option does
    not show the <b>.safe</b> keymap because it cannot be created in that
    fashion; however, neither is `<b>bindkey -lL .safe</b>' reported as an
    error, it simply outputs nothing.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="d"><a class="permalink" href="#d"><b>-d</b></a></dt>
  <dd>Delete all existing keymaps and reset to the default state.</dd>
  <dt id="D"><a class="permalink" href="#D"><b>-D</b> <i>keymap</i> ...</a></dt>
  <dd>Delete the named <i>keymap</i>s.</dd>
  <dt id="A"><a class="permalink" href="#A"><b>-A</b> <i>old-keymap
    new-keymap</i></a></dt>
  <dd>Make the <i>new-keymap</i> name an alias for <i>old-keymap</i>, so that
      both names refer to the same keymap. The names have equal standing; if
      either is deleted, the other remains. If there is already a keymap with
      the <i>new-keymap</i> name, it is deleted.</dd>
  <dt id="N"><a class="permalink" href="#N"><b>-N</b> <i>new-keymap</i> [
    <i>old-keymap</i> ]</a></dt>
  <dd>Create a new keymap, named <i>new-keymap</i>. If a keymap already has that
      name, it is deleted. If an <i>old-keymap</i> name is given, the new keymap
      is initialized to be a duplicate of it, otherwise the new keymap will be
      empty.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">To use a newly created keymap, it should be linked to <b>main</b>.
    Hence the sequence of commands to create and use a new keymap `<b>mymap</b>'
    initialized from the <b>emacs</b> keymap (which remains unchanged) is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre><b>bindkey -N mymap emacs</b>
<b>bindkey -A mymap main</b></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that while `<b>bindkey -A</b> <i>newmap</i> <b>main</b>' will
    work when <i>newmap</i> is <b>emacs</b> or <b>viins</b>, it will not work
    for <b>vicmd</b>, as switching from vi insert to command mode becomes
    impossible.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following operations act on the `<b>main</b>' keymap if no
    keymap selection option was given:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-m</b></dt>
  <dd>Add the built-in set of meta-key bindings to the selected keymap. Only
      keys that are unbound or bound to <b>self-insert</b> are affected.</dd>
  <dt id="r"><a class="permalink" href="#r"><b>-r</b> <i>in-string</i>
    ...</a></dt>
  <dd>Unbind the specified <i>in-string</i>s in the selected keymap. This is
      exactly equivalent to binding the strings to <b>undefined-key</b>.</dd>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">When <b>-R</b> is also used, interpret the <i>in-string</i>s as
    ranges.</p>
<p class="Pp">When <b>-p</b> is also used, the <i>in-string</i>s specify
    prefixes. Any binding that has the given <i>in-string</i> as a prefix, not
    including the binding for the <i>in-string</i> itself, if any, will be
    removed. For example,</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre><b>bindkey -rpM viins '^['</b></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">will remove all bindings in the vi-insert keymap beginning with an
    escape character (probably cursor keys), but leave the binding for the
    escape character itself (probably <b>vi-cmd-mode</b>). This is incompatible
    with the option <b>-R</b>.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="s"><a class="permalink" href="#s"><b>-s</b> <i>in-string
    out-string</i> ...</a></dt>
  <dd>Bind each <i>in-string</i> to each <i>out-string</i>. When
      <i>in-string</i> is typed, <i>out-string</i> will be pushed back and
      treated as input to the line editor. When <b>-R</b> is also used,
      interpret the <i>in-string</i>s as ranges.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Note that both <i>in-string</i> and <i>out-string</i> are subject

      bindings in the selected keymap are displayed. (As a special case, if the
      <b>-e</b> or <b>-v</b> option is used alone, the keymap is <i>not</i>
      displayed - the implicit linking of keymaps is the only thing that
      happens.)</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">When the option <b>-p</b> is used, the <i>in-string</i> must be

      system calls; most modern systems do.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Installs <i>handler</i> (the name of a shell function) to handle
    input from file descriptor <i>fd</i>. Installing a handler for an <i>fd</i>
    which is already handled causes the existing handler to be replaced. Any
    number of handlers for any number of readable file descriptors may be
    installed. Note that zle makes no attempt to check whether this <i>fd</i> is
    actually readable when installing the handler. The user must make their own
    arrangements for handling the file descriptor when zle is not active.</p>
<p class="Pp">When zle is attempting to read data, it will examine both the
    terminal and the list of handled <i>fd</i>'s. If data becomes available on a
    handled <i>fd</i>, zle calls <i>handler</i> with the fd which is ready for
    reading as the first argument. Under normal circumstances this is the only
    argument, but if an error was detected, a second argument provides details:
    `<b>hup</b>' for a disconnect, `<b>nval</b>' for a closed or otherwise
    invalid descriptor, or `<b>err</b>' for any other condition. Systems that
    support only the `select' system call always use `<b>err</b>'.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the option <b>-w</b> is also given, the <i>handler</i> is
    instead a line editor widget, typically a shell function made into a widget
    using `<b>zle -N</b>'. In that case <i>handler</i> can use all the
    facilities of zle to update the current editing line. Note, however, that as
    handling <i>fd</i> takes place at a low level changes to the display will
    not automatically appear; the widget should call `<b>zle -R</b>' to force
    redisplay. As of this writing, widget handlers only support a single
    argument and thus are never passed a string for error state, so widgets must
    be prepared to test the descriptor themselves.</p>
<p class="Pp">If either type of handler produces output to the terminal, it
    should call `<b>zle -I</b>' before doing so (see below). Handlers should not
    attempt to read from the terminal.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no <i>handler</i> is given, but an <i>fd</i> is present, any
    handler for that <i>fd</i> is removed. If there is none, an error message is
    printed and status 1 is returned.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no arguments are given, or the <b>-L</b> option is supplied, a
    list of handlers is printed in a form which can be stored for later
    execution.</p>
<p class="Pp">An <i>fd</i> (but not a <i>handler</i>) may optionally be given
    with the <b>-L</b> option; in this case, the function will list the handler
    if any, else silently return status 1.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that this feature should be used with care. Activity on one
    of the <i>fd</i>'s which is not properly handled can cause the terminal to
    become unusable. Removing an <i>fd</i> handler from within a signal trap may
    cause unpredictable behavior.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is a simple example of using this feature. A connection to a
    remote TCP port is created using the ztcp command; see the description of
    the <b>zsh/net/tcp</b> module in <i>zshmodules</i>(1). Then a handler is
    installed which simply prints out any data which arrives on this connection.
    Note that `select' will indicate that the file descriptor needs handling if
    the remote side has closed the connection; we handle that by testing for a
    failed read.</p>

  <dd>Unusually, this option is most useful outside ordinary widget functions,
      though it may be used within if normal output to the terminal is required.
      It invalidates the current zle display in preparation for output;
      typically this will be from a trap function. It has no effect if zle is
      not active. When a trap exits, the shell checks to see if the display
      needs restoring, hence the following will print output in such a way as
      not to disturb the line being edited:</dd>

<b>  # Invalidate zle display</b>
<b>  [[ -o zle ]] &amp;&amp; zle -I</b>
<b>  # Show output</b>
<b>  print Hello</b>
<b>}</b></pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In general, the trap function may need to test whether zle is
    active before using this method (as shown in the example), since the
    <b>zsh/zle</b> module may not even be loaded; if it is not, the command can
    be skipped.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is possible to call `<b>zle -I</b>' several times before
    control is returned to the editor; the display will only be invalidated the
    first time to minimise disruption.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that there are normally better ways of manipulating the
    display from within zle widgets; see, for example, `<b>zle -R</b>'
  above.</p>
<p class="Pp">The returned status is zero if zle was invalidated, even though
    this may have been by a previous call to `<b>zle -I</b>' or by a system
    notification. To test if a zle widget may be called at this point, execute
    <b>zle</b> with no arguments and examine the return status.</p>

    that is passed as a second argument. The function should set the shell
    variable <b>REPLY</b> to the transformed termcap code. Typically this is

<p class="Pp">With the option <b>-K</b>, <i>keymap</i> will be used as the

<p class="Pp">Normally, calling a widget in this way does not set the special

<p class="Pp">Normally, when <i>widget</i> returns the special parameter
    <b>LASTWIDGET</b> will point to it. This can be inhibited by passing the

<p class="Pp">Any further arguments will be passed to the widget; note that as
    standard argument handling is performed, any general argument list should be
    preceded by <b>-</b><b>-</b>. If it is a shell function, these are passed
    down as positional parameters; for builtin widgets it is up to the widget in
    question what it does with them. Currently arguments are only handled by the
    incremental-search commands, the <b>history-search-forward</b> and
    <b>-backward</b> and the corresponding functions prefixed by <b>vi-</b>, and

<p class="Pp">The return status reflects the success or failure of the operation
    carried out by the widget, or if it is a user-defined widget the return

<p class="Pp">A non-zero return status causes the shell to beep when the widget
    exits, unless the <b>BEEP</b> options was unset or the widget was called via
    the <b>zle</b> command. Thus if a user defined widget requires an immediate
    beep, it should call the <b>beep</b> widget directly.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ZLE_WIDGETS"><a class="permalink" href="#ZLE_WIDGETS">ZLE
  WIDGETS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">All actions in the editor are performed by `widgets'. A widget's
    job is simply to perform some small action. The ZLE commands that key
    sequences in keymaps are bound to are in fact widgets. Widgets can be
    user-defined or built in.</p>
<p class="Pp">The standard widgets built into ZLE are listed in the section
    `Standard Widgets' below. Other built-in widgets can be defined by other
    modules (see <i>zshmodules</i>(1)). Each built-in widget has two names: its
    normal canonical name, and the same name preceded by a `<b>.</b>'. The
    `<b>.</b>' name is special: it can't be rebound to a different widget. This
    makes the widget available even when its usual name has been redefined.</p>
<p class="Pp">User-defined widgets are defined using `<b>zle -N</b>', and
    implemented as shell functions. When the widget is executed, the
    corresponding shell function is executed, and can perform editing (or other)
    actions. It is recommended that user-defined widgets should not have names
    starting with `<b>.</b>'.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="USER"><a class="permalink" href="#USER">USER-DEFINED
  WIDGETS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">User-defined widgets, being implemented as shell functions, can
    execute any normal shell command. They can also run other widgets (whether
    built-in or user-defined) using the <b>zle</b> builtin command. The standard
    input of the function is redirected from /dev/null to prevent external
    commands from unintentionally blocking ZLE by reading from the terminal, but
    <b>read -k</b> or <b>read -q</b> can be used to read characters. Finally,
    they can examine and edit the ZLE buffer being edited by reading and setting
    the special parameters described below.</p>
<p class="Pp">These special parameters are always available in widget functions,
    but are not in any way special outside ZLE. If they have some normal value
    outside ZLE, that value is temporarily inaccessible, but will return when
    the widget function exits. These special parameters in fact have local
    scope, like parameters created in a function using <b>local</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Inside completion widgets and traps called while ZLE is active,
    these parameters are available read-only.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the parameters appear as local to any ZLE widget in
    which they appear. Hence if it is desired to override them this needs to be
    done within a nested function:</p>

<p class="Pp">When called from a shell function invoked from a user-defined
    widget, the command can take one to three arguments. The first argument
    specifies a history offset which applies to successive calls to this widget:
    if it is -1, the default behaviour is used, while if it is 1, successive
    calls will move forwards through the history. The value 0 can be used to
    indicate that the history line examined by the previous execution of the
    command will be reexamined. Note that negative numbers should be preceded by
    a `<b>-</b><b>-</b>' argument to avoid confusing them with options.</p>
<p class="Pp">If two arguments are given, the second specifies the word on the
    command line in normal array index notation (as a more natural alternative
    to the numeric argument). Hence 1 is the first word, and -1 (the default) is
    the last word.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a third argument is given, its value is ignored, but it is used
    to signify that the history offset is relative to the current history line,
    rather than the one remembered after the previous invocations of
    <b>insert-last-word</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, the default behaviour of the command corresponds
  to</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre><b>zle insert-last-word -- -1 -1</b></pre>

      user-defined widget. The status returned is non-zero if the return was
      caused by an error, but the function still continues executing and hence
      may tidy up. This makes it safe for the user-defined widget to alter the

<p class="Pp">The line editor has the ability to highlight characters or regions
    of the line that have a particular significance. This is controlled by the
    array parameter <b>zle_highlight</b>, if it has been set by the user.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the parameter contains the single entry <b>none</b> all
    highlighting is turned off. Note the parameter is still expected to be an
    array.</p>
<p class="Pp">Otherwise each entry of the array should consist of a word
    indicating a context for highlighting, then a colon, then a comma-separated
    list of the types of highlighting to apply in that context.</p>
<p class="Pp">The contexts available for highlighting are the following:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dt id="region"><a class="permalink" href="#region"><b>region</b></a></dt>
  <dd>The currently selected text. In emacs terminology, this is referred to as
      the region and is bounded by the cursor (point) and the mark. The region
      is only highlighted if it is active, which is the case after the mark is
      modified with <b>set-mark-command</b> or <b>exchange-point-and-mark</b>.
      Note that whether or not the region is active has no effect on its use
      within emacs style widgets, it simply determines whether it is
      highlighted. In vi mode, the region corresponds to selected text in visual
      mode.</dd>

<p class="Pp">On recent terminals and on systems with an up-to-date terminal
    database the number of colours supported may be tested by the command
    `<b>echotc</b> <b>Co</b>'; if this succeeds, it indicates a limit on the

<p class="Pp">Some modern terminal emulators have support for 24-bit true colour
    (16 million colours). In this case, the hex triplet format can be used. This
    consists of a `<b>#</b>' followed by either a three or six digit hexadecimal
    number describing the red, green and blue components of the colour. Hex
    triplets can also be used with 88 and 256 colour terminals via the
