<p class="Pp">Perl 5.26.3 represents approximately 8 months of development since
    Perl 5.26.2 and contains approximately 4,500 lines of changes across 51
    files from 15 authors.</p>
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 770 lines of changes to 10 .pm, .t, .c and .h
    files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.26.3:</p>
<p class="Pp">Aaron Crane, Abigail, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Dagfinn Ilmari
    Mannsaaker, David Mitchell, H.Merijn Brand, James E Keenan, John SJ
    Anderson, Karen Etheridge, Karl Williamson, Sawyer X, Steve Hay, Todd
    Rinaldo, Tony Cook, Yves Orton.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
