    methods</a></dt>
  <dd>A <b>method</b> used to indirectly inspect or update an <b>object</b>Xs
      state (its <b>instance</b> <b>variables</b>).</dd>
  <dt id="actual"><a class="permalink" href="#actual">actual arguments</a></dt>
  <dd>The <b>scalar values</b> that you supply to a <b>function</b> or
      <b>subroutine</b> when you call it. For instance, when you call
      <span class="Li">&quot;power(&quot;puff&quot;)&quot;</span>, the string
      <span class="Li">&quot;puff&quot;</span> is the actual argument. See also
      <b>argument</b> and <b>formal arguments</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="address"><a class="permalink" href="#address">address
    operator</a></dt>
  <dd>Some languages work directly with the memory addresses of values, but this
      can be like playing with fire. Perl provides a set of asbestos gloves for
      handling all memory management. The closest to an address operator in Perl
      is the backslash operator, but it gives you a <b>hard reference</b>, which
      is much safer than a memory address.</dd>
  <dt id="algorithm"><a class="permalink" href="#algorithm">algorithm</a></dt>
  <dd>A well-defined sequence of steps, explained clearly enough that even a
      computer could do them.</dd>
  <dt id="alias"><a class="permalink" href="#alias">alias</a></dt>
  <dd>A nickname for something, which behaves in all ways as though youXd used
      the original name instead of the nickname. Temporary aliases are
      implicitly created in the loop variable for
      <span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> loops, in the
      <span class="Li">$_</span> variable for
      <span class="Li">&quot;map&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;grep&quot;</span> operators, in
      <span class="Li">$a</span> and <span class="Li">$b</span> during
      <span class="Li">&quot;sort&quot;</span>Xs comparison function, and in
      each element of <span class="Li">@_</span> for the <b>actual arguments</b>
      of a subroutine call. Permanent aliases are explicitly created in
      <b>packages</b> by <b>importing</b> symbols or by assignment to
      <b>typeglobs</b>. Lexically scoped aliases for package variables are
      explicitly created by the <span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span>
      declaration.</dd>
  <dt id="alphabetic"><a class="permalink" href="#alphabetic">alphabetic</a></dt>
  <dd>The sort of characters we put into words. In Unicode, this is all letters

      numerals, and various combining marks.</dd>
  <dt id="alternatives"><a class="permalink" href="#alternatives">alternatives</a></dt>
  <dd>A list of possible choices from which you may select only one, as in,
      XWould you like door A, B, or C?X Alternatives in regular expressions are
      separated with a single vertical bar:
      <span class="Li">&quot;|&quot;</span>. Alternatives in normal Perl
      expressions are separated with a double vertical bar:
      <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span>. Logical alternatives in
      <b>Boolean</b> expressions are separated with either
      <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;or&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt id="anonymous"><a class="permalink" href="#anonymous">anonymous</a></dt>
  <dd>Used to describe a <b>referent</b> that is not directly accessible through
      a named <b>variable</b>. Such a referent must be indirectly accessible
      through at least one <b>hard reference</b>. When the last hard reference
      goes away, the anonymous referent is destroyed without pity.</dd>
  <dt id="application"><a class="permalink" href="#application">application</a></dt>

      donXt realize they are using a program.</dd>
  <dt id="architecture"><a class="permalink" href="#architecture">architecture</a></dt>
  <dd>The kind of computer youXre working on, where one Xkind of computerX means
      all those computers sharing a compatible machine language. Since Perl
      programs are (typically) simple text files, not executable images, a Perl
      program is much less sensitive to the architecture itXs running on than
      programs in other languages, such as C, that are <b>compiled</b> into
      machine code. See also <b>platform</b> and <b>operating system</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="argument"><a class="permalink" href="#argument">argument</a></dt>
  <dd>A piece of data supplied to a <b>program</b>, <b>subroutine</b>,
      <b>function</b>, or <b>method</b> to tell it what itXs supposed to do.
      Also called a XparameterX.</dd>
  <dt id="ARGV"><a class="permalink" href="#ARGV">ARGV</a></dt>
  <dd>The name of the array containing the <b>argument</b> <b>vector</b> from
      the command line. If you use the empty
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;&gt;&quot;</span> operator,
      <span class="Li">&quot;ARGV&quot;</span> is the name of both the
      <b>filehandle</b> used to traverse the arguments and the <b>scalar</b>
      containing the name of the current input file.</dd>
  <dt id="arithmetical"><a class="permalink" href="#arithmetical">arithmetical
    operator</a></dt>
  <dd>A <b>symbol</b> such as <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span> or
      <span class="Li">&quot;/&quot;</span> that tells Perl to do the arithmetic
      you were supposed to learn in grade school.</dd>
  <dt id="array"><a class="permalink" href="#array">array</a></dt>
  <dd>An ordered sequence of <b>values</b>, stored such that you can easily
      access any of the values using an <i>integer subscript</i> that specifies
      the valueXs <b>offset</b> in the sequence.</dd>
  <dt>array context</dt>
  <dd>An archaic expression for what is more correctly referred to as <b>list
      context</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="Artistic"><a class="permalink" href="#Artistic">Artistic
    License</a></dt>
  <dd>The open source license that Larry Wall created for Perl, maximizing
      PerlXs usefulness, availability, and modifiability. The current version is
      2. (&lt;http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php&gt;).</dd>
  <dt id="ASCII"><a class="permalink" href="#ASCII">ASCII</a></dt>
  <dd>The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (a 7-bit character
      set adequate only for poorly representing English text). Often used
      loosely to describe the lowest 128 values of the various ISO-8859-X
      character sets, a bunch of mutually incompatible 8-bit codes best
      described as half ASCII. See also <b>Unicode</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="assertion"><a class="permalink" href="#assertion">assertion</a></dt>
  <dd>A component of a <b>regular expression</b> that must be true for the
      pattern to match but does not necessarily match any characters itself.
      Often used specifically to mean a <b>zero-width</b> assertion.</dd>
  <dt id="assignment"><a class="permalink" href="#assignment">assignment</a></dt>
  <dd>An <b>operator</b> whose assigned mission in life is to change the value
      of a <b>variable</b>.</dd>
  <dt>assignment operator</dt>
  <dd>Either a regular <b>assignment</b> or a compound <b>operator</b> composed
      of an ordinary assignment and some other operator, that changes the value
      of a variable in place; that is, relative to its old value. For example,
      <span class="Li">&quot;$a += 2&quot;</span> adds <span class="Li">2</span>
      to <span class="Li">$a</span>.</dd>
  <dt id="associative"><a class="permalink" href="#associative">associative
    array</a></dt>
  <dd>See <b>hash</b>. Please. The term associative array is the old Perl 4 term
      for a <b>hash</b>. Some languages call it a dictionary.</dd>
  <dt id="associativity"><a class="permalink" href="#associativity">associativity</a></dt>
  <dd>Determines whether you do the left <b>operator</b> first or the right
      <b>operator</b> first when you have XA <b>operator</b> B <b>operator</b>
      CX, and the two operators are of the same precedence. Operators like
      <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span> are left associative, while
      operators like <span class="Li">&quot;**&quot;</span> are right
      associative. See Camel chapter 3, XUnary and Binary OperatorsX for a list
      of operators and their associativity.</dd>
  <dt id="asynchronous"><a class="permalink" href="#asynchronous">asynchronous</a></dt>
  <dd>Said of events or activities whose relative temporal ordering is
      indeterminate because too many things are going on at once. Hence, an
      asynchronous event is one you didnXt know when to expect.</dd>
  <dt id="atom"><a class="permalink" href="#atom">atom</a></dt>
  <dd>A <b>regular expression</b> component potentially matching a
      <b>substring</b> containing one or more characters and treated as an
      indivisible syntactic unit by any following <b>quantifier</b>. (Contrast
      with an <b>assertion</b> that matches something of <b>zero width</b> and
      may not be quantified.)</dd>
  <dt id="atomic"><a class="permalink" href="#atomic">atomic operation</a></dt>
  <dd>When Democritus gave the word XatomX to the indivisible bits of matter, he
      meant literally something that could not be cut: <i>X-</i> (not) +
      <i>-XXXXX</i> (cuttable). An atomic operation is an action that canXt be
      interrupted, not one forbidden in a nuclear-free zone.</dd>
  <dt id="attribute"><a class="permalink" href="#attribute">attribute</a></dt>
  <dd>A new feature that allows the declaration of <b>variables</b> and
      <b>subroutines</b> with modifiers, as in <span class="Li">&quot;sub foo :
      locked</span> <span class="Li">method&quot;</span>. Also another name for
      an <b>instance variable</b> of an <b>object</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="autogeneration"><a class="permalink" href="#autogeneration">autogeneration</a></dt>
  <dd>A feature of <b>operator overloading</b> of <b>objects</b>, whereby the
      behavior of certain <b>operators</b> can be reasonably deduced using more
      fundamental operators. This assumes that the overloaded operators will
      often have the same relationships as the regular operators. See Camel
      chapter 13, XOverloadingX.</dd>
  <dt id="autoincrement"><a class="permalink" href="#autoincrement">autoincrement</a></dt>
  <dd>To add one to something automatically, hence the name of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;++&quot;</span> operator. To instead subtract one
      from something automatically is known as an XautodecrementX.</dd>
  <dt id="autoload"><a class="permalink" href="#autoload">autoload</a></dt>
  <dd>To load on demand. (Also called XlazyX loading.) Specifically, to call an
      <span class="Li">&quot;AUTOLOAD&quot;</span> subroutine on behalf of an
      undefined subroutine.</dd>
  <dt id="autosplit"><a class="permalink" href="#autosplit">autosplit</a></dt>
  <dd>To split a string automatically, as the <i>Xa</i> <b>switch</b> does when
      running under <i>Xp</i> or <i>Xn</i> in order to emulate <b>awk</b>. (See
      also the <span class="Li">&quot;AutoSplit&quot;</span> module, which has
      nothing to do with the <span class="Li">&quot;Xa&quot;</span> switch but a
      lot to do with autoloading.)</dd>
  <dt id="autovivification"><a class="permalink" href="#autovivification">autovivification</a></dt>
  <dd>A Graeco-Roman word meaning Xto bring oneself to lifeX. In Perl, storage
      locations (<b>lvalues</b>) spontaneously generate themselves as needed,
      including the creation of any <b>hard reference</b> values to point to the
      next level of storage. The assignment
      <span class="Li">&quot;$a[5][5][5][5][5] =
      &quot;quintet&quot;&quot;</span> potentially creates five scalar storage
      locations, plus four references (in the first four scalar locations)
      pointing to four new anonymous arrays (to hold the last four scalar
      locations). But the point of autovivification is that you donXt have to
      worry about it.</dd>
  <dt id="AV"><a class="permalink" href="#AV">AV</a></dt>
  <dd>Short for Xarray valueX, which refers to one of PerlXs internal data types
      that holds an <b>array</b>. The <span class="Li">&quot;AV&quot;</span>
      type is a subclass of <b>SV</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="awk"><a class="permalink" href="#awk">awk</a></dt>
  <dd>Descriptive editing termXshort for XawkwardX. Also coincidentally refers
      to a venerable text-processing language from which Perl derived some of
      its high-level ideas.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt id="backreference"><a class="permalink" href="#backreference">backreference</a></dt>
  <dd>A substring <b>captured</b> by a subpattern within unadorned parentheses
      in a <b>regex</b>. Backslashed decimal numbers
      (<span class="Li">&quot;\1&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;\2&quot;</span>, etc.) later in the same pattern
      refer back to the corresponding subpattern in the current match. Outside
      the pattern, the numbered variables (<span class="Li">$1</span>,
      <span class="Li">$2</span>, etc.) continue to refer to these same values,
      as long as the pattern was the last successful match of the current
      <b>dynamic scope</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="backtracking"><a class="permalink" href="#backtracking">backtracking</a></dt>
  <dd>The practice of saying, XIf I had to do it all over, IXd do it
      differently,X and then actually going back and doing it all over
      differently. Mathematically speaking, itXs returning from an unsuccessful
      recursion on a tree of possibilities. Perl backtracks when it attempts to
      match patterns with a <b>regular expression</b>, and its earlier attempts
      donXt pan out. See the section XThe Little Engine That /Couldn(nXt)X in
      Camel chapter 5, XPattern MatchingX.</dd>
  <dt id="backward"><a class="permalink" href="#backward">backward
    compatibility</a></dt>

      the features or bugs it was relying on.</dd>
  <dt id="bareword"><a class="permalink" href="#bareword">bareword</a></dt>
  <dd>A word sufficiently ambiguous to be deemed illegal under
      <span class="Li">&quot;use strict 'subs'&quot;</span>. In the absence of
      that stricture, a bareword is treated as if quotes were around it.</dd>
  <dt id="base"><a class="permalink" href="#base">base class</a></dt>
  <dd>A generic <b>object</b> type; that is, a <b>class</b> from which other,
      more specific classes are derived genetically by <b>inheritance</b>. Also
      called a XsuperclassX by people who respect their ancestors.</dd>
  <dt id="big-endian"><a class="permalink" href="#big-endian">big-endian</a></dt>
  <dd>From Swift: someone who eats eggs big end first. Also used of computers
      that store the most significant <b>byte</b> of a word at a lower byte
      address than the least significant byte. Often considered superior to
      little-endian machines. See also <b>little-endian</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="binary"><a class="permalink" href="#binary">binary</a></dt>
  <dd>Having to do with numbers represented in base 2. That means thereXs
      basically two numbers: 0 and 1. Also used to describe a file of XnontextX,
      presumably because such a file makes full use of all the binary bits in
      its bytes. With the advent of <b>Unicode</b>, this distinction, already
      suspect, loses even more of its meaning.</dd>
  <dt>binary operator</dt>
  <dd>An <b>operator</b> that takes two <b>operands</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="bind"><a class="permalink" href="#bind">bind</a></dt>
  <dd>To assign a specific <b>network address</b> to a <b>socket</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="bit"><a class="permalink" href="#bit">bit</a></dt>
  <dd>An integer in the range from 0 to 1, inclusive. The smallest possible unit
      of information storage. An eighth of a <b>byte</b> or of a dollar. (The
      term XPieces of EightX comes from being able to split the old Spanish
      dollar into 8 bits, each of which still counted for money. ThatXs why a
      25- cent piece today is still Xtwo bitsX.)</dd>
  <dt>bit shift</dt>
  <dd>The movement of bits left or right in a computer word, which has the
      effect of multiplying or dividing by a power of 2.</dd>
  <dt>bit string</dt>
  <dd>A sequence of <b>bits</b> that is actually being thought of as a sequence
      of bits, for once.</dd>
  <dt id="bless"><a class="permalink" href="#bless">bless</a></dt>
  <dd>In corporate life, to grant official approval to a thing, as in, XThe VP
      of Engineering has blessed our WebCruncher project.X Similarly, in Perl,
      to grant official approval to a <b>referent</b> so that it can function as
      an <b>object</b>, such as a WebCruncher object. See the

      XFunctionsX.</dd>
  <dt id="block"><a class="permalink" href="#block">block</a></dt>
  <dd>What a <b>process</b> does when it has to wait for something: XMy process
      blocked waiting for the disk.X As an unrelated noun, it refers to a large
      chunk of data, of a size that the <b>operating system</b> likes to deal
      with (normally a power of 2 such as 512 or 8192). Typically refers to a
      chunk of data thatXs coming from or going to a disk file.</dd>
  <dt id="BLOCK"><a class="permalink" href="#BLOCK">BLOCK</a></dt>
  <dd>A syntactic construct consisting of a sequence of Perl <b>statements</b>
      that is delimited by braces. The <span class="Li">&quot;if&quot;</span>
      and <span class="Li">&quot;while&quot;</span> statements are defined in
      terms of <i></i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;BLOCK&quot;</i></span><i></i>s,
      for instance. Sometimes we also say XblockX to mean a lexical scope; that
      is, a sequence of statements that acts like a
      <i></i><span class="Li"><i>&quot;BLOCK&quot;</i></span><i></i>, such as
      within an <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span> or a file, even though
      the statements arenXt delimited by braces.</dd>
  <dt>block buffering</dt>
  <dd>A method of making input and output efficient by passing one <b>block</b>
      at a time. By default, Perl does block buffering to disk files. See
      <b>buffer</b> and <b>command buffering</b>.</dd>
  <dt id="Boolean"><a class="permalink" href="#Boolean">Boolean</a></dt>
  <dd>A value that is either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.</dd>

  <dd>A special kind of <b>scalar</b> <b>context</b> used in conditionals to
      decide whether the <b>scalar value</b> returned by an expression is
      <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>. Does not evaluate as either a string or a

      itXs passed every time you do a <span class="Li">&quot;print&quot;</span>
      command (or equivalent). If your output is unbuffered, the system

  <dd>This always means your main memory, not your disk. Clouding the issue is
      the fact that your machine may implement <b>virtual</b> memory; that is,
      it will pretend that it has more memory than it really does, and itXll use
      disk space to hold inactive bits. This can make it seem like you have a
      little more memory than you really do, but itXs not a substitute for real
      memory. The best thing that can be said about virtual memory is that it
      lets your performance degrade gradually rather than suddenly when you run
      out of real memory. But your program can die when you run out of virtual
      memory, tooXif you havenXt thrashed your disk to death first.</dd>

  <dd>A <b>function</b> call directly to the <b>operating</b> <b>system</b>.
      Many of the important subroutines and functions you use arenXt direct
      system calls, but are built up in one or more layers above the system call
      level. In general, Perl programmers donXt need to worry about the
      distinction. However, if you do happen to know which Perl functions are
      really syscalls, you can predict which of these will set the
      <span class="Li">$!</span> (<span class="Li">$ERRNO</span>) variable on
      failure. Unfortunately, beginning programmers often confusingly employ the
      term Xsystem callX to mean what happens when you call the Perl
      <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> function, which actually
      involves many syscalls. To avoid any confusion, we nearly always say
      XsyscallX for something you could call indirectly via PerlXs
      <span class="Li">&quot;syscall&quot;</span> function, and never for
      something you would call with PerlXs
      <span class="Li">&quot;system&quot;</span> function.</dd>

      integers in dot notation, for instance,
      <span class="Li">&quot;v1.20.300.4000&quot;</span>. Each number turns into
      a <b>character</b> with the specified ordinal value. (The
      <span class="Li">&quot;v&quot;</span> is optional when there are at least
      three integers.)</dd>

  <dt id="weak"><a class="permalink" href="#weak">weak reference</a></dt>
  <dd>A reference that doesnXt get counted normally. When all the normal

  <dd>In normal XcomputereseX, the piece of data of the size most efficiently
      handled by your computer, typically 32 bits or so, give or take a few
      powers of 2. In Perl culture, it more often refers to an alphanumeric

  <dd>What You See Is What You Get. Usually used when something that appears on
      the screen matches how it will eventually look, like PerlXs
      <span class="Li">&quot;format&quot;</span> declarations. Also used to mean
      the opposite of magic because everything works exactly as it appears, as
