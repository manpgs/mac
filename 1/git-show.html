<p class="Pp">Shows one or more objects (blobs, trees, tags and commits).</p>
<p class="Pp">For commits it shows the log message and textual diff. It also
    presents the merge commit in a special format as produced by <i>git
    diff-tree --cc</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">For tags, it shows the tag message and the referenced objects.</p>
<p class="Pp">For trees, it shows the names (equivalent to <i>git ls-tree</i>
    with --name-only).</p>
<p class="Pp">For plain blobs, it shows the plain contents.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command takes options applicable to the <i>git diff-tree</i>
    command to control how the changes the commit introduces are shown.</p>
<p class="Pp">This manual page describes only the most frequently used
  options.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">&lt;object&gt;...</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The names of objects to show (defaults to <i>HEAD</i>).
  For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see &quot;SPECIFYING
  REVISIONS&quot; section in <b>gitrevisions</b>(7).</div>
<p class="Pp">--pretty[=&lt;format&gt;], --format=&lt;format&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Pretty-print the contents of the commit logs in a given
  format, where <i>&lt;format&gt;</i> can be one of <i>oneline</i>,
  <i>short</i>, <i>medium</i>, <i>full</i>, <i>fuller</i>, <i>reference</i>,
  <i>email</i>, <i>raw</i>, <i>format:&lt;string&gt;</i> and
  <i>tformat:&lt;string&gt;</i>. When <i>&lt;format&gt;</i> is none of the
  above, and has <i>%placeholder</i> in it, it acts as if
  <i>--pretty=tformat:&lt;format&gt;</i> were given.
<p class="Pp">See the &quot;PRETTY FORMATS&quot; section for some additional
    details for each format. When <i>=&lt;format&gt;</i> part is omitted, it
    defaults to <i>medium</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository
    configuration (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--abbrev-commit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit
  object name, show a prefix that names the object uniquely.
  &quot;--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;&quot; (which also modifies diff output, if it is
  displayed) option can be used to specify the minimum length of the prefix.
<p class="Pp">This should make &quot;--pretty=oneline&quot; a whole lot more
    readable for people using 80-column terminals.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-abbrev-commit</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the full 40-byte hexadecimal commit object name.
  This negates <b>--abbrev-commit</b>, either explicit or implied by other
  options such as &quot;--oneline&quot;. It also overrides the
  <b>log.abbrevCommit</b> variable.</div>
<p class="Pp">--oneline</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This is a shorthand for &quot;--pretty=oneline
  --abbrev-commit&quot; used together.</div>
<p class="Pp">--encoding=&lt;encoding&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Commit objects record the character encoding used for the
  log message in their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the
  command to re-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by the
  user. For non plumbing commands this defaults to UTF-8. Note that if an object
  claims to be encoded in <b>X</b> and we are outputting in <b>X</b>, we will
  output the object verbatim; this means that invalid sequences in the original
  commit may be copied to the output. Likewise, if iconv(3) fails to convert the
  commit, we will quietly output the original object verbatim.</div>
<p class="Pp">--expand-tabs=&lt;n&gt;, --expand-tabs, --no-expand-tabs</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Perform a tab expansion (replace each tab with enough
  spaces to fill to the next display column that is multiple of
  <i>&lt;n&gt;</i>) in the log message before showing it in the output.
  <b>--expand-tabs</b> is a short-hand for <b>--expand-tabs=8</b>, and
  <b>--no-expand-tabs</b> is a short-hand for <b>--expand-tabs=0</b>, which
  disables tab expansion.
<p class="Pp">By default, tabs are expanded in pretty formats that indent the
    log message by 4 spaces (i.e. <i>medium</i>, which is the default,
    <i>full</i>, and <i>fuller</i>).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--notes[=&lt;ref&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the notes (see <b>git-notes</b>(1)) that annotate
  the commit, when showing the commit log message. This is the default for
  <b>git log</b>, <b>git show</b> and <b>git whatchanged</b> commands when there
  is no <b>--pretty</b>, <b>--format</b>, or <b>--oneline</b> option given on
  the command line.
<p class="Pp">By default, the notes shown are from the notes refs listed in the
    <b>core.notesRef</b> and <b>notes.displayRef</b> variables (or corresponding
    environment overrides). See <b>git-config</b>(1) for more details.</p>
<p class="Pp">With an optional <i>&lt;ref&gt;</i> argument, use the ref to find
    the notes to display. The ref can specify the full refname when it begins
    with <b>refs/notes/</b>; when it begins with <b>notes/</b>, <b>refs/</b> and
    otherwise <b>refs/notes/</b> is prefixed to form a full name of the ref.</p>
<p class="Pp">Multiple --notes options can be combined to control which notes
    are being displayed. Examples: &quot;--notes=foo&quot; will show only notes
    from &quot;refs/notes/foo&quot;; &quot;--notes=foo --notes&quot; will show
    both notes from &quot;refs/notes/foo&quot; and from the default notes
    ref(s).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-notes</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not show notes. This negates the above <b>--notes</b>
  option, by resetting the list of notes refs from which notes are shown.
  Options are parsed in the order given on the command line, so e.g.
  &quot;--notes --notes=foo --no-notes --notes=bar&quot; will only show notes
  from &quot;refs/notes/bar&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">--show-notes[=&lt;ref&gt;], --[no-]standard-notes</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">These options are deprecated. Use the above
  --notes/--no-notes options instead.</div>
<p class="Pp">--show-signature</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Check the validity of a signed commit object by passing
  the signature to <b>gpg --verify</b> and show the output.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="PRETTY_FORMATS"><a class="permalink" href="#PRETTY_FORMATS">PRETTY
  FORMATS</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty-format is not
    <i>oneline</i>, <i>email</i> or <i>raw</i>, an additional line is inserted
    before the <i>Author:</i> line. This line begins with &quot;Merge: &quot;
    and the hashes of ancestral commits are printed, separated by spaces. Note
    that the listed commits may not necessarily be the list of the <b>direct</b>
    parent commits if you have limited your view of history: for example, if you
    are only interested in changes related to a certain directory or file.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are several built-in formats, and you can define additional
    formats by setting a pretty.&lt;name&gt; config option to either another
    format name, or a <i>format:</i> string, as described below (see
    <b>git-config</b>(1)). Here are the details of the built-in formats:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>oneline</i>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>&lt;hash&gt; &lt;title-line&gt;</pre>

<p class="Pp">This is designed to be as compact as possible.</p>

<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>&lt;abbrev-hash&gt; (&lt;title-line&gt;, &lt;short-author-date&gt;)</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This format is used to refer to another commit in a commit message
    and is the same as <b>--pretty='format:%C(auto)%h (%s, %ad)'</b>. By
    default, the date is formatted with <b>--date=short</b> unless another
    <b>--date</b> option is explicitly specified. As with any <b>format:</b>
    with format placeholders, its output is not affected by other options like
    <b>--decorate</b> and <b>--walk-reflogs</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>email</i>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">

<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>&lt;full-commit-message&gt;</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>mboxrd</i>
<p class="Pp">Like <i>email</i>, but lines in the commit message starting with
    &quot;From &quot; (preceded by zero or more &quot;&gt;&quot;) are quoted
    with &quot;&gt;&quot; so they aren&#x2019;t confused as starting a new
    commit.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>raw</i>
<p class="Pp">The <i>raw</i> format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in
    the commit object. Notably, the hashes are displayed in full, regardless of
    whether --abbrev or --no-abbrev are used, and <i>parents</i> information
    show the true parent commits, without taking grafts or history
    simplification into account. Note that this format affects the way commits
    are displayed, but not the way the diff is shown e.g. with <b>git log
    --raw</b>. To get full object names in a raw diff format, use
    <b>--no-abbrev</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>format:&lt;format-string&gt;</i>
<p class="Pp">The <i>format:&lt;format-string&gt;</i> format allows you to
    specify which information you want to show. It works a little bit like
    printf format, with the notable exception that you get a newline with
    <i>%n</i> instead of <i>\n</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">E.g, <i>format:&quot;The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was
    &gt;&gt;%s&lt;&lt;%n&quot;</i> would show something like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>The author of fe6e0ee was Junio C Hamano, 23 hours ago
The title was &gt;&gt;t4119: test autocomputing -p&lt;n&gt; for traditional diff input.&lt;&lt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The placeholders are:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Placeholders that expand to a single literal
  character:
<p class="Pp"><i>%n</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">newline</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>%%</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">a raw <i>%</i></div>
<p class="Pp"><i>%x00</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">print a byte from a hex code</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Placeholders that affect formatting of later
  placeholders:
<p class="Pp"><i>%Cred</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">switch color to red</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>%Cgreen</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">switch color to green</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>%Cblue</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">switch color to blue</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>%Creset</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">reset color</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>%C(...)</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">color specification, as described under Values in the
  &quot;CONFIGURATION FILE&quot; section of <b>git-config</b>(1). By default,
  colors are shown only when enabled for log output (by <b>color.diff</b>,
  <b>color.ui</b>, or <b>--color</b>, and respecting the <b>auto</b> settings of
  the former if we are going to a terminal). <b>%C(auto,...)</b> is accepted as
  a historical synonym for the default (e.g., <b>%C(auto,red)</b>). Specifying
  <b>%C(always,...)</b> will show the colors even when color is not otherwise
  enabled (though consider just using <b>--color=always</b> to enable color for
  the whole output, including this format and anything else git might color).
  <b>auto</b> alone (i.e. <b>%C(auto)</b>) will turn on auto coloring on the
  next placeholders until the color is switched again.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>%m</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">left (<b>&lt;</b>), right (<b>&gt;</b>) or boundary
  (<b>-</b>) mark</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>%w([&lt;w&gt;[,&lt;i1&gt;[,&lt;i2&gt;]]])</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">switch line wrapping, like the -w option of
  <b>git-shortlog</b>(1).</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>%&lt;(&lt;N&gt;[,trunc|ltrunc|mtrunc])</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">make the next placeholder take at least N columns,
  padding spaces on the right if necessary. Optionally truncate at the beginning
  (ltrunc), the middle (mtrunc) or the end (trunc) if the output is longer than
  N columns. Note that truncating only works correctly with N &gt;= 2.</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>%&lt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">make the next placeholder take at least until Nth
  columns, padding spaces on the right if necessary</div>

<p class="Pp"><i>%&gt;&gt;(&lt;N&gt;)</i>, <i>%&gt;&gt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">similar to <i>%&gt;(&lt;N&gt;)</i>,
  <i>%&gt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</i> respectively, except that if the next placeholder
  takes more spaces than given and there are spaces on its left, use those
  spaces</div>
<p class="Pp"><i>%&gt;&lt;(&lt;N&gt;)</i>, <i>%&gt;&lt;|(&lt;N&gt;)</i></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">similar to <i>%&lt;(&lt;N&gt;)</i>,

  so that non-trailer lines in the trailer block are hidden. If that is not

  separator one must use <b>%x2C</b> as it would otherwise be parsed as next

<b>Note</b>
<p class="Pp">Some placeholders may depend on other options given to the
    revision traversal engine. For example, the <b>%g*</b> reflog options will
    insert an empty string unless we are traversing reflog entries (e.g., by
    <b>git log -g</b>). The <b>%d</b> and <b>%D</b> placeholders will use the
    &quot;short&quot; decoration format if <b>--decorate</b> was not already
    provided on the command line.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The boolean options accept an optional value
    <b>[=&lt;bool-value&gt;]</b>. The values <b>true</b>, <b>false</b>,
    <b>on</b>, <b>off</b> etc. are all accepted. See the &quot;boolean&quot;
    sub-section in &quot;EXAMPLES&quot; in <b>git-config</b>(1). If a boolean
    option is given with no value, it&#x2019;s enabled.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you add a <b>+</b> (plus sign) after <i>%</i> of a placeholder,
    a line-feed is inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the
    placeholder expands to a non-empty string.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you add a <b>-</b> (minus sign) after <i>%</i> of a
    placeholder, all consecutive line-feeds immediately preceding the expansion
    are deleted if and only if the placeholder expands to an empty string.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you add a ` ` (space) after <i>%</i> of a placeholder, a space
    is inserted immediately before the expansion if and only if the placeholder
    expands to a non-empty string.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;<i>tformat:</i>
<p class="Pp">The <i>tformat:</i> format works exactly like <i>format:</i>,
    except that it provides &quot;terminator&quot; semantics instead of
    &quot;separator&quot; semantics. In other words, each commit has the message
    terminator character (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator
    placed between entries. This means that the final entry of a single-line
    format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the
    &quot;oneline&quot; format does. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git log -2 --pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \
  | perl -pe '$_ .= &quot; -- NO NEWLINE\n&quot; unless /\n/'
4da45be
7134973 -- NO NEWLINE
$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef \
  | perl -pe '$_ .= &quot; -- NO NEWLINE\n&quot; unless /\n/'
4da45be
7134973</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">In addition, any unrecognized string that has a <b>%</b> in it is
    interpreted as if it has <b>tformat:</b> in front of it. For example, these
    two are equivalent:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>$ git log -2 --pretty=tformat:%h 4da45bef
$ git log -2 --pretty=%h 4da45bef</pre>

  FORMATTING</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The options below can be used to change the way <b>git show</b>
    generates diff output.</p>
<p class="Pp">-p, -u, --patch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate patch (see section on generating patches).</div>
<p class="Pp">-s, --no-patch</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Suppress diff output. Useful for commands like <b>git
  show</b> that show the patch by default, or to cancel the effect of
  <b>--patch</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-merges=(off|none|on|first-parent|1|separate|m|combined|c|dense-combined|cc|remerge|r),
    --no-diff-merges</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify diff format to be used for merge commits. Default
  is <b>dense-combined</b> unless <b>--first-parent</b> is in use, in which case
  <b>first-parent</b> is the default.
<p class="Pp">--diff-merges=(off|none), --no-diff-merges</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disable output of diffs for merge commits. Useful to
  override implied value.</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-merges=on, --diff-merges=m, -m</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option makes diff output for merge commits to be
  shown in the default format. <b>-m</b> will produce the output only if
  <b>-p</b> is given as well. The default format could be changed using
  <b>log.diffMerges</b> configuration parameter, which default value is
  <b>separate</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-merges=first-parent, --diff-merges=1</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This option makes merge commits show the full diff with
  respect to the first parent only.</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-merges=separate</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This makes merge commits show the full diff with respect
  to each of the parents. Separate log entry and diff is generated for each
  parent.</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-merges=remerge, --diff-merges=r, --remerge-diff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">With this option, two-parent merge commits are remerged
  to create a temporary tree object &#x2014; potentially containing files with
  conflict markers and such. A diff is then shown between that temporary tree
  and the actual merge commit.
<p class="Pp">The output emitted when this option is used is subject to change,
    and so is its interaction with other options (unless explicitly
  documented).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-merges=combined, --diff-merges=c, -c</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">With this option, diff output for a merge commit shows
  the differences from each of the parents to the merge result simultaneously
  instead of showing pairwise diff between a parent and the result one at a
  time. Furthermore, it lists only files which were modified from all parents.
  <b>-c</b> implies <b>-p</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-merges=dense-combined, --diff-merges=cc, --cc</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">With this option the output produced by
  <b>--diff-merges=combined</b> is further compressed by omitting uninteresting
  hunks whose contents in the parents have only two variants and the merge
  result picks one of them without modification. <b>--cc</b> implies
  <b>-p</b>.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--combined-all-paths</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This flag causes combined diffs (used for merge commits)
  to list the name of the file from all parents. It thus only has effect when
  <b>--diff-merges=[dense-]combined</b> is in use, and is likely only useful if
  filename changes are detected (i.e. when either rename or copy detection have
  been requested).</div>
<p class="Pp">-U&lt;n&gt;, --unified=&lt;n&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate diffs with &lt;n&gt; lines of context instead of
  the usual three. Implies <b>--patch</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--output=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output to a specific file instead of stdout.</div>
<p class="Pp">--output-indicator-new=&lt;char&gt;,
    --output-indicator-old=&lt;char&gt;,
  --output-indicator-context=&lt;char&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify the character used to indicate new, old or
  context lines in the generated patch. Normally they are <i>+</i>, <i>-</i> and
  ' ' respectively.</div>
<p class="Pp">--raw</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For each commit, show a summary of changes using the raw
  diff format. See the &quot;RAW OUTPUT FORMAT&quot; section of
  <b>git-diff</b>(1). This is different from showing the log itself in raw
  format, which you can achieve with <b>--format=raw</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--patch-with-raw</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for <b>-p --raw</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-t</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the tree objects in the diff output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--indent-heuristic</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Enable the heuristic that shifts diff hunk boundaries to
  make patches easier to read. This is the default.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-indent-heuristic</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disable the indent heuristic.</div>
<p class="Pp">--minimal</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff
  is produced.</div>
<p class="Pp">--patience</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate a diff using the &quot;patience diff&quot;
  algorithm.</div>
<p class="Pp">--histogram</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate a diff using the &quot;histogram diff&quot;
  algorithm.</div>
<p class="Pp">--anchored=&lt;text&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate a diff using the &quot;anchored diff&quot;
  algorithm.
<p class="Pp">This option may be specified more than once.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a line exists in both the source and destination, exists only
    once, and starts with this text, this algorithm attempts to prevent it from
    appearing as a deletion or addition in the output. It uses the
    &quot;patience diff&quot; algorithm internally.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-algorithm={patience|minimal|histogram|myers}</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Choose a diff algorithm. The variants are as follows:
<p class="Pp"><b>default</b>, <b>myers</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The basic greedy diff algorithm. Currently, this is the
  default.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>minimal</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Spend extra time to make sure the smallest possible diff
  is produced.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>patience</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use &quot;patience diff&quot; algorithm when generating
  patches.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>histogram</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This algorithm extends the patience algorithm to
  &quot;support low-occurrence common elements&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">For instance, if you configured the <b>diff.algorithm</b> variable
    to a non-default value and want to use the default one, then you have to use
    <b>--diff-algorithm=default</b> option.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--stat[=&lt;width&gt;[,&lt;name-width&gt;[,&lt;count&gt;]]]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Generate a diffstat. By default, as much space as
  necessary will be used for the filename part, and the rest for the graph part.
  Maximum width defaults to terminal width, or 80 columns if not connected to a
  terminal, and can be overridden by <b>&lt;width&gt;</b>. The width of the
  filename part can be limited by giving another width <b>&lt;name-width&gt;</b>
  after a comma. The width of the graph part can be limited by using
  <b>--stat-graph-width=&lt;width&gt;</b> (affects all commands generating a
  stat graph) or by setting <b>diff.statGraphWidth=&lt;width&gt;</b> (does not
  affect <b>git format-patch</b>). By giving a third parameter
  <b>&lt;count&gt;</b>, you can limit the output to the first
  <b>&lt;count&gt;</b> lines, followed by <b>...</b> if there are more.
<p class="Pp">These parameters can also be set individually with
    <b>--stat-width=&lt;width&gt;</b>,
    <b>--stat-name-width=&lt;name-width&gt;</b> and
    <b>--stat-count=&lt;count&gt;</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--compact-summary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output a condensed summary of extended header information
  such as file creations or deletions (&quot;new&quot; or &quot;gone&quot;,
  optionally &quot;+l&quot; if it&#x2019;s a symlink) and mode changes
  (&quot;+x&quot; or &quot;-x&quot; for adding or removing executable bit
  respectively) in diffstat. The information is put between the filename part
  and the graph part. Implies <b>--stat</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--numstat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Similar to <b>--stat</b>, but shows number of added and
  deleted lines in decimal notation and pathname without abbreviation, to make
  it more machine friendly. For binary files, outputs two <b>-</b> instead of
  saying <b>0 0</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--shortstat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output only the last line of the <b>--stat</b> format
  containing total number of modified files, as well as number of added and
  deleted lines.</div>
<p class="Pp">-X[&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;],
    --dirstat[=&lt;param1,param2,...&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output the distribution of relative amount of changes for
  each sub-directory. The behavior of <b>--dirstat</b> can be customized by
  passing it a comma separated list of parameters. The defaults are controlled
  by the <b>diff.dirstat</b> configuration variable (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).
  The following parameters are available:
<p class="Pp"><b>changes</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that
  have been removed from the source, or added to the destination. This ignores
  the amount of pure code movements within a file. In other words, rearranging
  lines in a file is not counted as much as other changes. This is the default
  behavior when no parameter is given.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>lines</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular
  line-based diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts. (For
  binary files, count 64-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural
  concept of lines). This is a more expensive <b>--dirstat</b> behavior than the
  <b>changes</b> behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as
  much as other changes. The resulting output is consistent with what you get
  from the other <b>--*stat</b> options.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>files</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of
  files changed. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis. This
  is the computationally cheapest <b>--dirstat</b> behavior, since it does not
  have to look at the file contents at all.</div>
<p class="Pp"><b>cumulative</b></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Count changes in a child directory for the parent
  directory as well. Note that when using <b>cumulative</b>, the sum of the
  percentages reported may exceed 100%. The default (non-cumulative) behavior
  can be specified with the <b>noncumulative</b> parameter.</div>
<p class="Pp">&lt;limit&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">An integer parameter specifies a cut-off percent (3% by
  default). Directories contributing less than this percentage of the changes
  are not shown in the output.</div>
<p class="Pp">Example: The following will count changed files, while ignoring
    directories with less than 10% of the total amount of changed files, and
    accumulating child directory counts in the parent directories:
    <b>--dirstat=files,10,cumulative</b>.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--cumulative</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for --dirstat=cumulative</div>
<p class="Pp">--dirstat-by-file[=&lt;param1,param2&gt;...]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for --dirstat=files,param1,param2...</div>
<p class="Pp">--summary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Output a condensed summary of extended header information
  such as creations, renames and mode changes.</div>
<p class="Pp">--patch-with-stat</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Synonym for <b>-p --stat</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-z</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Separate the commits with NULs instead of with new
  newlines.
<p class="Pp">Also, when <b>--raw</b> or <b>--numstat</b> has been given, do not
    munge pathnames and use NULs as output field terminators.</p>
<p class="Pp">Without this option, pathnames with &quot;unusual&quot; characters
    are quoted as explained for the configuration variable <b>core.quotePath</b>
    (see <b>git-config</b>(1)).</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--name-only</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show only names of changed files. The file names are
  often encoded in UTF-8. For more information see the discussion about encoding
  in the <b>git-log</b>(1) manual page.</div>
<p class="Pp">--name-status</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show only names and status of changed files. See the
  description of the <b>--diff-filter</b> option on what the status letters
  mean. Just like <b>--name-only</b> the file names are often encoded in
  UTF-8.</div>
<p class="Pp">--submodule[=&lt;format&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Specify how differences in submodules are shown. When
  specifying <b>--submodule=short</b> the <i>short</i> format is used. This
  format just shows the names of the commits at the beginning and end of the
  range. When <b>--submodule</b> or <b>--submodule=log</b> is specified, the
  <i>log</i> format is used. This format lists the commits in the range like
  <b>git-submodule</b>(1) <b>summary</b> does. When <b>--submodule=diff</b> is
  specified, the <i>diff</i> format is used. This format shows an inline diff of
  the changes in the submodule contents between the commit range. Defaults to
  <b>diff.submodule</b> or the <i>short</i> format if the config option is
  unset.</div>
<p class="Pp">--color[=&lt;when&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show colored diff. <b>--color</b> (i.e. without
  <i>=&lt;when&gt;</i>) is the same as <b>--color=always</b>.
  <i>&lt;when&gt;</i> can be one of <b>always</b>, <b>never</b>, or
  <b>auto</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-color</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn off colored diff. It is the same as
  <b>--color=never</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--color-moved[=&lt;mode&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Moved lines of code are colored differently. The
  &lt;mode&gt; defaults to <i>no</i> if the option is not given and to
  <i>zebra</i> if the option with no mode is given. The mode must be one of:
<p class="Pp">no</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Moved lines are not highlighted.</div>
<p class="Pp">default</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Is a synonym for <b>zebra</b>. This may change to a more
  sensible mode in the future.</div>
<p class="Pp">plain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Any line that is added in one location and was removed in
  another location will be colored with <i>color.diff.newMoved</i>. Similarly
  <i>color.diff.oldMoved</i> will be used for removed lines that are added
  somewhere else in the diff. This mode picks up any moved line, but it is not
  very useful in a review to determine if a block of code was moved without
  permutation.</div>
<p class="Pp">blocks</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Blocks of moved text of at least 20 alphanumeric
  characters are detected greedily. The detected blocks are painted using either
  the <i>color.diff.{old,new}Moved</i> color. Adjacent blocks cannot be told
  apart.</div>
<p class="Pp">zebra</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Blocks of moved text are detected as in <i>blocks</i>
  mode. The blocks are painted using either the <i>color.diff.{old,new}Moved</i>
  color or <i>color.diff.{old,new}MovedAlternative</i>. The change between the
  two colors indicates that a new block was detected.</div>
<p class="Pp">dimmed-zebra</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Similar to <i>zebra</i>, but additional dimming of
  uninteresting parts of moved code is performed. The bordering lines of two
  adjacent blocks are considered interesting, the rest is uninteresting.
  <b>dimmed_zebra</b> is a deprecated synonym.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-color-moved</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn off move detection. This can be used to override
  configuration settings. It is the same as <b>--color-moved=no</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--color-moved-ws=&lt;modes&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">This configures how whitespace is ignored when performing
  the move detection for <b>--color-moved</b>. These modes can be given as a
  comma separated list:
<p class="Pp">no</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not ignore whitespace when performing move
  detection.</div>
<p class="Pp">ignore-space-at-eol</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.</div>
<p class="Pp">ignore-space-change</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores
  whitespace at line end, and considers all other sequences of one or more
  whitespace characters to be equivalent.</div>
<p class="Pp">ignore-all-space</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores
  differences even if one line has whitespace where the other line has
  none.</div>
<p class="Pp">allow-indentation-change</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Initially ignore any whitespace in the move detection,
  then group the moved code blocks only into a block if the change in whitespace
  is the same per line. This is incompatible with the other modes.</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-color-moved-ws</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not ignore whitespace when performing move detection.
  This can be used to override configuration settings. It is the same as
  <b>--color-moved-ws=no</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--word-diff[=&lt;mode&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show a word diff, using the &lt;mode&gt; to delimit
  changed words. By default, words are delimited by whitespace; see
  <b>--word-diff-regex</b> below. The &lt;mode&gt; defaults to <i>plain</i>, and
  must be one of:
<p class="Pp">color</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Highlight changed words using only colors. Implies
  <b>--color</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">plain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show words as <b>[-removed-]</b> and <b>{+added+}</b>.
  Makes no attempts to escape the delimiters if they appear in the input, so the
  output may be ambiguous.</div>
<p class="Pp">porcelain</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use a special line-based format intended for script
  consumption. Added/removed/unchanged runs are printed in the usual unified
  diff format, starting with a <b>+</b>/<b>-</b>/` ` character at the beginning
  of the line and extending to the end of the line. Newlines in the input are
  represented by a tilde <b>~</b> on a line of its own.</div>
<p class="Pp">none</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disable word diff again.</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that despite the name of the first mode, color is used to
    highlight the changed parts in all modes if enabled.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--word-diff-regex=&lt;regex&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Use &lt;regex&gt; to decide what a word is, instead of
  considering runs of non-whitespace to be a word. Also implies
  <b>--word-diff</b> unless it was already enabled.
<p class="Pp">Every non-overlapping match of the &lt;regex&gt; is considered a
    word. Anything between these matches is considered whitespace and ignored(!)
    for the purposes of finding differences. You may want to append
    <b>|[^[:space:]]</b> to your regular expression to make sure that it matches
    all non-whitespace characters. A match that contains a newline is silently
    truncated(!) at the newline.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, <b>--word-diff-regex=.</b> will treat each character
    as a word and, correspondingly, show differences character by character.</p>
<p class="Pp">The regex can also be set via a diff driver or configuration
    option, see <b>gitattributes</b>(5) or <b>git-config</b>(1). Giving it
    explicitly overrides any diff driver or configuration setting. Diff drivers
    override configuration settings.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--color-words[=&lt;regex&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Equivalent to <b>--word-diff=color</b> plus (if a regex
  was specified) <b>--word-diff-regex=&lt;regex&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-renames</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Turn off rename detection, even when the configuration
  file gives the default to do so.</div>
<p class="Pp">--[no-]rename-empty</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Whether to use empty blobs as rename source.</div>
<p class="Pp">--check</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Warn if changes introduce conflict markers or whitespace
  errors. What are considered whitespace errors is controlled by
  <b>core.whitespace</b> configuration. By default, trailing whitespaces
  (including lines that consist solely of whitespaces) and a space character
  that is immediately followed by a tab character inside the initial indent of
  the line are considered whitespace errors. Exits with non-zero status if
  problems are found. Not compatible with --exit-code.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ws-error-highlight=&lt;kind&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Highlight whitespace errors in the <b>context</b>,
  <b>old</b> or <b>new</b> lines of the diff. Multiple values are separated by
  comma, <b>none</b> resets previous values, <b>default</b> reset the list to
  <b>new</b> and <b>all</b> is a shorthand for <b>old,new,context</b>. When this
  option is not given, and the configuration variable
  <b>diff.wsErrorHighlight</b> is not set, only whitespace errors in <b>new</b>
  lines are highlighted. The whitespace errors are colored with
  <b>color.diff.whitespace</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--full-index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of the first handful of characters, show the full
  pre- and post-image blob object names on the &quot;index&quot; line when
  generating patch format output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--binary</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">In addition to <b>--full-index</b>, output a binary diff
  that can be applied with <b>git-apply</b>. Implies <b>--patch</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--abbrev[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Instead of showing the full 40-byte hexadecimal object
  name in diff-raw format output and diff-tree header lines, show the shortest
  prefix that is at least <i>&lt;n&gt;</i> hexdigits long that uniquely refers
  the object. In diff-patch output format, <b>--full-index</b> takes higher
  precedence, i.e. if <b>--full-index</b> is specified, full blob names will be
  shown regardless of <b>--abbrev</b>. Non default number of digits can be
  specified with <b>--abbrev=&lt;n&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-B[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;],
    --break-rewrites[=[&lt;n&gt;][/&lt;m&gt;]]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and
  create. This serves two purposes:
<p class="Pp">It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a
    file not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very
    few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single
    deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything new,
    and the number <b>m</b> controls this aspect of the -B option (defaults to
    60%). <b>-B/70%</b> specifies that less than 30% of the original should
    remain in the result for Git to consider it a total rewrite (i.e. otherwise
    the resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion mixed
    together with context lines).</p>
<p class="Pp">When used with -M, a totally-rewritten file is also considered as
    the source of a rename (usually -M only considers a file that disappeared as
    the source of a rename), and the number <b>n</b> controls this aspect of the
    -B option (defaults to 50%). <b>-B20%</b> specifies that a change with
    addition and deletion compared to 20% or more of the file&#x2019;s size are
    eligible for being picked up as a possible source of a rename to another
    file.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-M[&lt;n&gt;], --find-renames[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">If generating diffs, detect and report renames for each
  commit. For following files across renames while traversing history, see
  <b>--follow</b>. If <b>n</b> is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity
  index (i.e. amount of addition/deletions compared to the file&#x2019;s size).
  For example, <b>-M90%</b> means Git should consider a delete/add pair to be a
  rename if more than 90% of the file hasn&#x2019;t changed. Without a <b>%</b>
  sign, the number is to be read as a fraction, with a decimal point before it.
  I.e., <b>-M5</b> becomes 0.5, and is thus the same as <b>-M50%</b>. Similarly,
  <b>-M05</b> is the same as <b>-M5%</b>. To limit detection to exact renames,
  use <b>-M100%</b>. The default similarity index is 50%.</div>
<p class="Pp">-C[&lt;n&gt;], --find-copies[=&lt;n&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Detect copies as well as renames. See also
  <b>--find-copies-harder</b>. If <b>n</b> is specified, it has the same meaning
  as for <b>-M&lt;n&gt;</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">--find-copies-harder</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">For performance reasons, by default, <b>-C</b> option
  finds copies only if the original file of the copy was modified in the same
  changeset. This flag makes the command inspect unmodified files as candidates
  for the source of copy. This is a very expensive operation for large projects,
  so use it with caution. Giving more than one <b>-C</b> option has the same
  effect.</div>
<p class="Pp">-D, --irreversible-delete</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Omit the preimage for deletes, i.e. print only the header
  but not the diff between the preimage and <b>/dev/null</b>. The resulting
  patch is not meant to be applied with <b>patch</b> or <b>git apply</b>; this
  is solely for people who want to just concentrate on reviewing the text after
  the change. In addition, the output obviously lacks enough information to
  apply such a patch in reverse, even manually, hence the name of the option.
<p class="Pp">When used together with <b>-B</b>, omit also the preimage in the
    deletion part of a delete/create pair.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-l&lt;num&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">The <b>-M</b> and <b>-C</b> options involve some
  preliminary steps that can detect subsets of renames/copies cheaply, followed
  by an exhaustive fallback portion that compares all remaining unpaired
  destinations to all relevant sources. (For renames, only remaining unpaired
  sources are relevant; for copies, all original sources are relevant.) For N
  sources and destinations, this exhaustive check is O(N^2). This option
  prevents the exhaustive portion of rename/copy detection from running if the
  number of source/destination files involved exceeds the specified number.
  Defaults to diff.renameLimit. Note that a value of 0 is treated as
  unlimited.</div>
<p class="Pp">--diff-filter=[(A|C|D|M|R|T|U|X|B)...[*]]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Select only files that are Added (<b>A</b>), Copied
  (<b>C</b>), Deleted (<b>D</b>), Modified (<b>M</b>), Renamed (<b>R</b>), have
  their type (i.e. regular file, symlink, submodule, ...) changed (<b>T</b>),
  are Unmerged (<b>U</b>), are Unknown (<b>X</b>), or have had their pairing
  Broken (<b>B</b>). Any combination of the filter characters (including none)
  can be used. When <b>*</b> (All-or-none) is added to the combination, all
  paths are selected if there is any file that matches other criteria in the
  comparison; if there is no file that matches other criteria, nothing is
  selected.
<p class="Pp">Also, these upper-case letters can be downcased to exclude. E.g.
    <b>--diff-filter=ad</b> excludes added and deleted paths.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that not all diffs can feature all types. For instance,
    copied and renamed entries cannot appear if detection for those types is
    disabled.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-S&lt;string&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Look for differences that change the number of
  occurrences of the specified string (i.e. addition/deletion) in a file.
  Intended for the scripter&#x2019;s use.
<p class="Pp">It is useful when you&#x2019;re looking for an exact block of code
    (like a struct), and want to know the history of that block since it first
    came into being: use the feature iteratively to feed the interesting block
    in the preimage back into <b>-S</b>, and keep going until you get the very
    first version of the block.</p>
<p class="Pp">Binary files are searched as well.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">-G&lt;regex&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Look for differences whose patch text contains
  added/removed lines that match &lt;regex&gt;.
<p class="Pp">To illustrate the difference between <b>-S&lt;regex&gt;
    --pickaxe-regex</b> and <b>-G&lt;regex&gt;</b>, consider a commit with the
    following diff in the same file:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>+    return frotz(nitfol, two-&gt;ptr, 1, 0);
...
-    hit = frotz(nitfol, mf2.ptr, 1, 0);</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">While <b>git log -G&quot;frotz\(nitfol&quot;</b> will show this
    commit, <b>git log -S&quot;frotz\(nitfol&quot; --pickaxe-regex</b> will not
    (because the number of occurrences of that string did not change).</p>
<p class="Pp">Unless <b>--text</b> is supplied patches of binary files without a
    textconv filter will be ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">See the <i>pickaxe</i> entry in <b>gitdiffcore</b>(7) for more
    information.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--find-object=&lt;object-id&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Look for differences that change the number of
  occurrences of the specified object. Similar to <b>-S</b>, just the argument
  is different in that it doesn&#x2019;t search for a specific string but for a
  specific object id.
<p class="Pp">The object can be a blob or a submodule commit. It implies the
    <b>-t</b> option in <b>git-log</b> to also find trees.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--pickaxe-all</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When <b>-S</b> or <b>-G</b> finds a change, show all the
  changes in that changeset, not just the files that contain the change in
  &lt;string&gt;.</div>
<p class="Pp">--pickaxe-regex</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Treat the &lt;string&gt; given to <b>-S</b> as an
  extended POSIX regular expression to match.</div>
<p class="Pp">-O&lt;orderfile&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Control the order in which files appear in the output.
  This overrides the <b>diff.orderFile</b> configuration variable (see
  <b>git-config</b>(1)). To cancel <b>diff.orderFile</b>, use
  <b>-O/dev/null</b>.
<p class="Pp">The output order is determined by the order of glob patterns in
    &lt;orderfile&gt;. All files with pathnames that match the first pattern are
    output first, all files with pathnames that match the second pattern (but
    not the first) are output next, and so on. All files with pathnames that do
    not match any pattern are output last, as if there was an implicit match-all
    pattern at the end of the file. If multiple pathnames have the same rank
    (they match the same pattern but no earlier patterns), their output order
    relative to each other is the normal order.</p>
<p class="Pp">&lt;orderfile&gt; is parsed as follows:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Blank lines are ignored, so they can be used as
  separators for readability.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Lines starting with a hash (&quot;<b>#</b>&quot;)
  are ignored, so they can be used for comments. Add a backslash
  (&quot;<b>\</b>&quot;) to the beginning of the pattern if it starts with a
  hash.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Each other line contains a single pattern.</div>
<p class="Pp">Patterns have the same syntax and semantics as patterns used for
    fnmatch(3) without the FNM_PATHNAME flag, except a pathname also matches a
    pattern if removing any number of the final pathname components matches the
    pattern. For example, the pattern &quot;<b>foo*bar</b>&quot; matches
    &quot;<b>fooasdfbar</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>foo/bar/baz/asdf</b>&quot; but
    not &quot;<b>foobarx</b>&quot;.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">--skip-to=&lt;file&gt;, --rotate-to=&lt;file&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Discard the files before the named &lt;file&gt; from the
  output (i.e. <i>skip to</i>), or move them to the end of the output (i.e.
  <i>rotate to</i>). These were invented primarily for use of the <b>git
  difftool</b> command, and may not be very useful otherwise.</div>
<p class="Pp">-R</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Swap two inputs; that is, show differences from index or
  on-disk file to tree contents.</div>
<p class="Pp">--relative[=&lt;path&gt;], --no-relative</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">When run from a subdirectory of the project, it can be
  told to exclude changes outside the directory and show pathnames relative to
  it with this option. When you are not in a subdirectory (e.g. in a bare
  repository), you can name which subdirectory to make the output relative to by
  giving a &lt;path&gt; as an argument. <b>--no-relative</b> can be used to
  countermand both <b>diff.relative</b> config option and previous
  <b>--relative</b>.</div>
<p class="Pp">-a, --text</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Treat all files as text.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-cr-at-eol</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore carriage-return at the end of line when doing a
  comparison.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-space-at-eol</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes in whitespace at EOL.</div>
<p class="Pp">-b, --ignore-space-change</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes in amount of whitespace. This ignores
  whitespace at line end, and considers all other sequences of one or more
  whitespace characters to be equivalent.</div>
<p class="Pp">-w, --ignore-all-space</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore whitespace when comparing lines. This ignores
  differences even if one line has whitespace where the other line has
  none.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-blank-lines</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes whose lines are all blank.</div>
<p class="Pp">-I&lt;regex&gt;, --ignore-matching-lines=&lt;regex&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes whose all lines match &lt;regex&gt;. This
  option may be specified more than once.</div>
<p class="Pp">--inter-hunk-context=&lt;lines&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the context between diff hunks, up to the specified
  number of lines, thereby fusing hunks that are close to each other. Defaults
  to <b>diff.interHunkContext</b> or 0 if the config option is unset.</div>
<p class="Pp">-W, --function-context</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show whole function as context lines for each change. The
  function names are determined in the same way as <b>git diff</b> works out
  patch hunk headers (see <i>Defining a custom hunk-header</i> in
  <b>gitattributes</b>(5)).</div>
<p class="Pp">--ext-diff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow an external diff helper to be executed. If you set
  an external diff driver with <b>gitattributes</b>(5), you need to use this
  option with <b>git-log</b>(1) and friends.</div>
<p class="Pp">--no-ext-diff</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Disallow external diff drivers.</div>
<p class="Pp">--textconv, --no-textconv</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Allow (or disallow) external text conversion filters to
  be run when comparing binary files. See <b>gitattributes</b>(5) for details.
  Because textconv filters are typically a one-way conversion, the resulting
  diff is suitable for human consumption, but cannot be applied. For this
  reason, textconv filters are enabled by default only for <b>git-diff</b>(1)
  and <b>git-log</b>(1), but not for <b>git-format-patch</b>(1) or diff plumbing
  commands.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ignore-submodules[=&lt;when&gt;]</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation.
  &lt;when&gt; can be either &quot;none&quot;, &quot;untracked&quot;,
  &quot;dirty&quot; or &quot;all&quot;, which is the default. Using
  &quot;none&quot; will consider the submodule modified when it either contains
  untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded in
  the superproject and can be used to override any settings of the <i>ignore</i>
  option in <b>git-config</b>(1) or <b>gitmodules</b>(5). When
  &quot;untracked&quot; is used submodules are not considered dirty when they
  only contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified
  content). Using &quot;dirty&quot; ignores all changes to the work tree of
  submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the superproject are shown
  (this was the behavior until 1.7.0). Using &quot;all&quot; hides all changes
  to submodules.</div>
<p class="Pp">--src-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the given source prefix instead of
  &quot;a/&quot;.</div>
<p class="Pp">--dst-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Show the given destination prefix instead of

<p class="Pp">--no-prefix</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Do not show any source or destination prefix.</div>
<p class="Pp">--line-prefix=&lt;prefix&gt;</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">Prepend an additional prefix to every line of
  output.</div>
<p class="Pp">--ita-invisible-in-index</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">By default entries added by &quot;git add -N&quot; appear
  as an existing empty file in &quot;git diff&quot; and a new file in &quot;git
  diff --cached&quot;. This option makes the entry appear as a new file in
  &quot;git diff&quot; and non-existent in &quot;git diff --cached&quot;. This
  option could be reverted with <b>--ita-visible-in-index</b>. Both options are
  experimental and could be removed in future.</div>

<h1 class="Sh" id="GENERATING_PATCH_TEXT_WITH_"><a class="permalink" href="#GENERATING_PATCH_TEXT_WITH_">GENERATING
  PATCH TEXT WITH -P</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Running <b>git-diff</b>(1), <b>git-log</b>(1), <b>git-show</b>(1),
    <b>git-diff-index</b>(1), <b>git-diff-tree</b>(1), or
    <b>git-diff-files</b>(1) with the <b>-p</b> option produces patch text. You
    can customize the creation of patch text via the <b>GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF</b>
    and the <b>GIT_DIFF_OPTS</b> environment variables (see <b>git</b>(1)), and
    the <b>diff</b> attribute (see <b>gitattributes</b>(5)).</p>
<p class="Pp">What the -p option produces is slightly different from the
    traditional diff format:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.It is preceded with a &quot;git diff&quot; header that
  looks like this:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>diff --git a/file1 b/file2</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <b>a/</b> and <b>b/</b> filenames are the same unless
    rename/copy is involved. Especially, even for a creation or a deletion,
    <b>/dev/null</b> is <i>not</i> used in place of the <b>a/</b> or <b>b/</b>
    filenames.</p>
<p class="Pp">When rename/copy is involved, <b>file1</b> and <b>file2</b> show
    the name of the source file of the rename/copy and the name of the file that
    rename/copy produces, respectively.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.It is followed by one or more extended header lines:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>old mode &lt;mode&gt;
new mode &lt;mode&gt;
deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;
new file mode &lt;mode&gt;
copy from &lt;path&gt;

rename from &lt;path&gt;
rename to &lt;path&gt;
similarity index &lt;number&gt;
dissimilarity index &lt;number&gt;
index &lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt; &lt;mode&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">File modes are printed as 6-digit octal numbers including the file
    type and file permission bits.</p>
<p class="Pp">Path names in extended headers do not include the <b>a/</b> and
    <b>b/</b> prefixes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The similarity index is the percentage of unchanged lines, and the
    dissimilarity index is the percentage of changed lines. It is a rounded down
    integer, followed by a percent sign. The similarity index value of 100% is
    thus reserved for two equal files, while 100% dissimilarity means that no
    line from the old file made it into the new one.</p>
<p class="Pp">The index line includes the blob object names before and after the
    change. The &lt;mode&gt; is included if the file mode does not change;
    otherwise, separate lines indicate the old and the new mode.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.Pathnames with &quot;unusual&quot; characters are

<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.All the <b>file1</b> files in the output refer to
  files before the commit, and all the <b>file2</b> files refer to files after
  the commit. It is incorrect to apply each change to each file sequentially.
  For example, this patch will swap a and b:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>diff --git a/a b/b
rename from a
rename to b
diff --git a/b b/a
rename from b
rename to a</pre>

<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.It is preceded with a &quot;git diff&quot; header,
  that looks like this (when the <b>-c</b> option is used):
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>diff --combined file</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">or like this (when the <b>--cc</b> option is used):</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>diff --cc file</pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.It is followed by one or more extended header lines
  (this example shows a merge with two parents):
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>index &lt;hash&gt;,&lt;hash&gt;..&lt;hash&gt;
mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt;
new file mode &lt;mode&gt;
deleted file mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The <b>mode &lt;mode&gt;,&lt;mode&gt;..&lt;mode&gt;</b> line
    appears only if at least one of the &lt;mode&gt; is different from the rest.
    Extended headers with information about detected contents movement (renames
    and copying detection) are designed to work with diff of two
    &lt;tree-ish&gt; and are not used by combined diff format.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 3.It is followed by two-line from-file/to-file header
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>--- a/file
+++ b/file</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Similar to two-line header for traditional <i>unified</i> diff
    format, <b>/dev/null</b> is used to signal created or deleted files.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, if the --combined-all-paths option is provided, instead
    of a two-line from-file/to-file you get a N+1 line from-file/to-file header,
    where N is the number of parents in the merge commit</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>--- a/file
--- a/file
--- a/file
+++ b/file</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This extended format can be useful if rename or copy detection is
    active, to allow you to see the original name of the file in different
    parents.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 4.Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from
  accidentally feeding it to <b>patch -p1</b>. Combined diff format was created
  for review of merge commit changes, and was not meant to be applied. The
  change is similar to the change in the extended <i>index</i> header:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>@@@ &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;from-file-range&gt; &lt;to-file-range&gt; @@@</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">There are (number of parents + 1) <b>@</b> characters in the chunk
    header for combined diff format.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Unlike the traditional <i>unified</i> diff format, which shows two
    files A and B with a single column that has <b>-</b> (minus &#x2014; appears
    in A but removed in B), <b>+</b> (plus &#x2014; missing in A but added to
    B), or <b>&quot; &quot;</b> (space &#x2014; unchanged) prefix, this format
    compares two or more files file1, file2,... with one file X, and shows how X
    differs from each of fileN. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the
    output line to note how X&#x2019;s line is different from it.</p>
<p class="Pp">A <b>-</b> character in the column N means that the line appears
    in fileN but it does not appear in the result. A <b>+</b> character in the
    column N means that the line appears in the result, and fileN does not have
    that line (in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of
    that parent).</p>
<p class="Pp">In the above example output, the function signature was changed
    from both files (hence two <b>-</b> removals from both file1 and file2, plus
    <b>++</b> to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 or
    file2). Also eight other lines are the same from file1 but do not appear in
    file2 (hence prefixed with <b>+</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">When shown by <b>git diff-tree -c</b>, it compares the parents of
    a merge commit with the merge result (i.e. file1..fileN are the parents).
    When shown by <b>git diff-files -c</b>, it compares the two unresolved merge
    parents with the working tree file (i.e. file1 is stage 2 aka &quot;our
    version&quot;, file2 is stage 3 aka &quot;their version&quot;).</p>

<p class="Pp">Git is to some extent character encoding agnostic.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;The contents of the blob objects are
  uninterpreted sequences of bytes. There is no encoding translation at the core
  level.</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Path names are encoded in UTF-8 normalization
  form C. This applies to tree objects, the index file, ref names, as well as
  path names in command line arguments, environment variables and config files
  (<b>.git/config</b> (see <b>git-config</b>(1)), <b>gitignore</b>(5),
  <b>gitattributes</b>(5) and <b>gitmodules</b>(5)).
<p class="Pp">Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as
    sequences of non-NUL bytes, there are no path name encoding conversions
    (except on Mac and Windows). Therefore, using non-ASCII path names will
    mostly work even on platforms and file systems that use legacy extended
    ASCII encodings. However, repositories created on such systems will not work
    properly on UTF-8-based systems (e.g. Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice versa.
    Additionally, many Git-based tools simply assume path names to be UTF-8 and
    will fail to display other encodings correctly.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">&#x2022;Commit log messages are typically encoded in
  UTF-8, but other extended ASCII encodings are also supported. This includes
  ISO-8859-x, CP125x and many others, but <i>not</i> UTF-16/32, EBCDIC and CJK
  multi-byte encodings (GBK, Shift-JIS, Big5, EUC-x, CP9xx etc.).</div>
<p class="Pp">Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in
    UTF-8, both the core and Git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF-8 on
    projects. If all participants of a particular project find it more
    convenient to use legacy encodings, Git does not forbid it. However, there
    are a few things to keep in mind.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 1.<i>git commit</i> and <i>git commit-tree</i> issues a
  warning if the commit log message given to it does not look like a valid UTF-8
  string, unless you explicitly say your project uses a legacy encoding. The way
  to say this is to have <b>i18n.commitEncoding</b> in <b>.git/config</b> file,
  like this:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>[i18n]
        commitEncoding = ISO-8859-1</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Commit objects created with the above setting record the value of
    <b>i18n.commitEncoding</b> in its <b>encoding</b> header. This is to help
    other people who look at them later. Lack of this header implies that the
    commit log message is encoded in UTF-8.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent"> 2.<i>git log</i>, <i>git show</i>, <i>git blame</i> and
  friends look at the <b>encoding</b> header of a commit object, and try to
  re-code the log message into UTF-8 unless otherwise specified. You can specify
  the desired output encoding with <b>i18n.logOutputEncoding</b> in
  <b>.git/config</b> file, like this:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<pre>[i18n]
        logOutputEncoding = ISO-8859-1</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">If you do not have this configuration variable, the value of
    <b>i18n.commitEncoding</b> is used instead.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Note that we deliberately chose not to re-code the commit log
    message when a commit is made to force UTF-8 at the commit object level,
    because re-coding to UTF-8 is not necessarily a reversible operation.</p>
