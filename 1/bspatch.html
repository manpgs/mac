<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">bspatch</code> utility generates
    <var class="Ar">newfile</var> from <var class="Ar">oldfile</var> and
    <var class="Ar">patchfile</var> where <var class="Ar">patchfile</var> is a
    binary patch built by <a class="Xr" href="../1/bsdiff">bsdiff(1)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">bspatch</code> utility uses memory equal to
    the size of <var class="Ar">oldfile</var> plus the size of
    <var class="Ar">newfile</var>, but can tolerate a very small working set
    without a dramatic loss of performance.</p>

<p class="Pp">The <code class="Nm">bspatch</code> utility does not verify that
    <var class="Ar">oldfile</var> is the correct source file for
    <var class="Ar">patchfile</var>. Attempting to apply a patch to the wrong
    file will usually produce garbage; consequently it is strongly recommended
    that users of <code class="Nm">bspatch</code> verify that
    <var class="Ar">oldfile</var> matches the source file from which
    <var class="Ar">patchfile</var> was built, by comparing cryptographic
    hashes, for example. Users may also wish to verify after running
    <code class="Nm">bspatch</code> that <var class="Ar">newfile</var> matches
    the target file from which <var class="Ar">was built.</var></p>
