<p class="Pp">perlthrtut - Tutorial on threads in Perl</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">This tutorial describes the use of Perl interpreter threads
    (sometimes referred to as <i>ithreads</i>). In this model, each thread runs
    in its own Perl interpreter, and any data sharing between threads must be
    explicit. The user-level interface for <i>ithreads</i> uses the threads
    class.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>NOTE</b>: There was another older Perl threading flavor called
    the 5.005 model that used the threads class. This old model was known to
    have problems, is deprecated, and was removed for release 5.10. You are
    strongly encouraged to migrate any existing 5.005 threads code to the new
    model as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can see which (or neither) threading flavour you have by
    running <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span> and looking at the
    <span class="Li">&quot;Platform&quot;</span> section. If you have
    <span class="Li">&quot;useithreads=define&quot;</span> you have ithreads, if
    you have <span class="Li">&quot;use5005threads=define&quot;</span> you have
    5.005 threads. If you have neither, you don't have any thread support built
    in. If you have both, you are in trouble.</p>
<p class="Pp">The threads and threads::shared modules are included in the core
    Perl distribution. Additionally, they are maintained as a separate modules
    on CPAN, so you can check there for any updates.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="What_Is_A_Thread_Anyway?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_Is_A_Thread_Anyway?">What
  Is A Thread Anyway?</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">A thread is a flow of control through a program with a single
    execution point.</p>
<p class="Pp">Sounds an awful lot like a process, doesn't it? Well, it should.
    Threads are one of the pieces of a process. Every process has at least one
    thread and, up until now, every process running Perl had only one thread.
    With 5.8, though, you can create extra threads. We're going to show you how,
    when, and why.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Threaded_Program_Models"><a class="permalink" href="#Threaded_Program_Models">Threaded
  Program Models</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">There are three basic ways that you can structure a threaded
    program. Which model you choose depends on what you need your program to do.
    For many non-trivial threaded programs, you'll need to choose different
    models for different pieces of your program.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Boss/Worker"><a class="permalink" href="#Boss/Worker">Boss/Worker</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The boss/worker model usually has one <i>boss</i> thread and one
    or more <i>worker</i> threads. The boss thread gathers or generates tasks
    that need to be done, then parcels those tasks out to the appropriate worker
    thread.</p>
<p class="Pp">This model is common in GUI and server programs, where a main
    thread waits for some event and then passes that event to the appropriate
    worker threads for processing. Once the event has been passed on, the boss
    thread goes back to waiting for another event.</p>
<p class="Pp">The boss thread does relatively little work. While tasks aren't
    necessarily performed faster than with any other method, it tends to have
    the best user-response times.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Work_Crew"><a class="permalink" href="#Work_Crew">Work
  Crew</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In the work crew model, several threads are created that do
    essentially the same thing to different pieces of data. It closely mirrors
    classical parallel processing and vector processors, where a large array of
    processors do the exact same thing to many pieces of data.</p>
<p class="Pp">This model is particularly useful if the system running the
    program will distribute multiple threads across different processors. It can
    also be useful in ray tracing or rendering engines, where the individual
    threads can pass on interim results to give the user visual feedback.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Pipeline"><a class="permalink" href="#Pipeline">Pipeline</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The pipeline model divides up a task into a series of steps, and
    passes the results of one step on to the thread processing the next. Each
    thread does one thing to each piece of data and passes the results to the
    next thread in line.</p>
<p class="Pp">This model makes the most sense if you have multiple processors so
    two or more threads will be executing in parallel, though it can often make
    sense in other contexts as well. It tends to keep the individual tasks small
    and simple, as well as allowing some parts of the pipeline to block (on I/O
    or system calls, for example) while other parts keep going. If you're
    running different parts of the pipeline on different processors you may also
    take advantage of the caches on each processor.</p>
<p class="Pp">This model is also handy for a form of recursive programming
    where, rather than having a subroutine call itself, it instead creates
    another thread. Prime and Fibonacci generators both map well to this form of
    the pipeline model. (A version of a prime number generator is presented
    later on.)</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="What_kind_of_threads_are_Perl_threads?"><a class="permalink" href="#What_kind_of_threads_are_Perl_threads?">What
  kind of threads are Perl threads?</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">If you have experience with other thread implementations, you
    might find that things aren't quite what you expect. It's very important to
    remember when dealing with Perl threads that <i>Perl Threads Are Not X</i>
    <i>Threads</i> for all values of X. They aren't POSIX threads, or
    DecThreads, or Java's Green threads, or Win32 threads. There are
    similarities, and the broad concepts are the same, but if you start looking
    for implementation details you're going to be either disappointed or
    confused. Possibly both.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is not to say that Perl threads are completely different from
    everything that's ever come before. They're not. Perl's threading model owes
    a lot to other thread models, especially POSIX. Just as Perl is not C,
    though, Perl threads are not POSIX threads. So if you find yourself looking
    for mutexes, or thread priorities, it's time to step back a bit and think
    about what you want to do and how Perl can do it.</p>
<p class="Pp">However, it is important to remember that Perl threads cannot
    magically do things unless your operating system's threads allow it. So if
    your system blocks the entire process on
    <span class="Li">&quot;sleep()&quot;</span>, Perl usually will, as well.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Perl Threads Are Different.</b></p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Thread-Safe_Modules"><a class="permalink" href="#Thread-Safe_Modules">Thread-Safe
  Modules</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The addition of threads has changed Perl's internals
    substantially. There are implications for people who write modules with XS
    code or external libraries. However, since Perl data is not shared among
    threads by default, Perl modules stand a high chance of being thread-safe or
    can be made thread-safe easily. Modules that are not tagged as thread-safe
    should be tested or code reviewed before being used in production code.</p>
<p class="Pp">Not all modules that you might use are thread-safe, and you should
    always assume a module is unsafe unless the documentation says otherwise.
    This includes modules that are distributed as part of the core. Threads are
    a relatively new feature, and even some of the standard modules aren't
    thread-safe.</p>
<p class="Pp">Even if a module is thread-safe, it doesn't mean that the module
    is optimized to work well with threads. A module could possibly be rewritten
    to utilize the new features in threaded Perl to increase performance in a
    threaded environment.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you're using a module that's not thread-safe for some reason,
    you can protect yourself by using it from one, and only one thread at all.
    If you need multiple threads to access such a module, you can use semaphores
    and lots of programming discipline to control access to it. Semaphores are
    covered in &quot;Basic semaphores&quot;.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Thread_Basics"><a class="permalink" href="#Thread_Basics">Thread
  Basics</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The threads module provides the basic functions you need to write
    threaded programs. In the following sections, we'll cover the basics,
    showing you what you need to do to create a threaded program. After that,
    we'll go over some of the features of the threads module that make threaded
    programming easier.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Basic_Thread_Support"><a class="permalink" href="#Basic_Thread_Support">Basic
  Thread Support</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Thread support is a Perl compile-time option. It's something
    that's turned on or off when Perl is built at your site, rather than when
    your programs are compiled. If your Perl wasn't compiled with thread support
    enabled, then any attempt to use threads will fail.</p>
<p class="Pp">Your programs can use the Config module to check whether threads
    are enabled. If your program can't run without them, you can say something
    like:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Config;
    $Config{useithreads} or die('Recompile Perl with threads to run this program.');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">A possibly-threaded program using a possibly-threaded module might
    have code like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use Config;
    use MyMod;

    BEGIN {
        if ($Config{useithreads}) {
            # We have threads
            require MyMod_threaded;
            import MyMod_threaded;
        } else {
            require MyMod_unthreaded;
            import MyMod_unthreaded;
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Since code that runs both with and without threads is usually
    pretty messy, it's best to isolate the thread-specific code in its own
    module. In our example above, that's what
    <span class="Li">&quot;MyMod_threaded&quot;</span> is, and it's only
    imported if we're running on a threaded Perl.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="A_Note_about_the_Examples"><a class="permalink" href="#A_Note_about_the_Examples">A
  Note about the Examples</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">In a real situation, care should be taken that all threads are
    finished executing before the program exits. That care has <b>not</b> been
    taken in these examples in the interest of simplicity. Running these
    examples <i>as is</i> will produce error messages, usually caused by the
    fact that there are still threads running when the program exits. You should
    not be alarmed by this.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Creating_Threads"><a class="permalink" href="#Creating_Threads">Creating
  Threads</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The threads module provides the tools you need to create new
    threads. Like any other module, you need to tell Perl that you want to use
    it; <span class="Li">&quot;use threads;&quot;</span> imports all the pieces
    you need to create basic threads.</p>
<p class="Pp">The simplest, most straightforward way to create a thread is with
    <span class="Li">&quot;create()&quot;</span>:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use threads;

    my $thr = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;sub1);

    sub sub1 {
        print(&quot;In the thread\n&quot;);
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;create()&quot;</span> method takes a
    reference to a subroutine and creates a new thread that starts executing in
    the referenced subroutine. Control then passes both to the subroutine and
    the caller.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you need to, your program can pass parameters to the subroutine
    as part of the thread startup. Just include the list of parameters as part
    of the <span class="Li">&quot;threads-&gt;create()&quot;</span> call, like
    this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use threads;

    my $Param3 = 'foo';
    my $thr1 = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;sub1, 'Param 1', 'Param 2', $Param3);
    my @ParamList = (42, 'Hello', 3.14);
    my $thr2 = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;sub1, @ParamList);
    my $thr3 = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;sub1, qw(Param1 Param2 Param3));

    sub sub1 {
        my @InboundParameters = @_;
        print(&quot;In the thread\n&quot;);
        print('Got parameters &gt;', join('&lt;&gt;', @InboundParameters), &quot;&lt;\n&quot;);
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The last example illustrates another feature of threads. You can
    spawn off several threads using the same subroutine. Each thread executes
    the same subroutine, but in a separate thread with a separate environment
    and potentially separate arguments.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span> is a synonym for
    <span class="Li">&quot;create()&quot;</span>.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Waiting_For_A_Thread_To_Exit"><a class="permalink" href="#Waiting_For_A_Thread_To_Exit">Waiting
  For A Thread To Exit</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Since threads are also subroutines, they can return values. To
    wait for a thread to exit and extract any values it might return, you can
    use the <span class="Li">&quot;join()&quot;</span> method:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use threads;

    my ($thr) = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;sub1);

    my @ReturnData = $thr-&gt;join();
    print('Thread returned ', join(', ', @ReturnData), &quot;\n&quot;);

    sub sub1 { return ('Fifty-six', 'foo', 2); }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In the example above, the
    <span class="Li">&quot;join()&quot;</span> method returns as soon as the
    thread ends. In addition to waiting for a thread to finish and gathering up
    any values that the thread might have returned,
    <span class="Li">&quot;join()&quot;</span> also performs any OS cleanup
    necessary for the thread. That cleanup might be important, especially for
    long-running programs that spawn lots of threads. If you don't want the
    return values and don't want to wait for the thread to finish, you should
    call the <span class="Li">&quot;detach()&quot;</span> method instead, as
    described next.</p>
<p class="Pp">NOTE: In the example above, the thread returns a list, thus
    necessitating that the thread creation call be made in list context (i.e.,
    <span class="Li">&quot;my ($thr)&quot;</span>). See
    &quot;$thr-&gt;<i>join()</i>&quot; in threads and &quot;THREAD CONTEXT&quot;
    in threads for more details on thread context and return values.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Ignoring_A_Thread"><a class="permalink" href="#Ignoring_A_Thread">Ignoring
  A Thread</a></h2>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;join()&quot;</span> does three things: it
    waits for a thread to exit, cleans up after it, and returns any data the
    thread may have produced. But what if you're not interested in the thread's
    return values, and you don't really care when the thread finishes? All you
    want is for the thread to get cleaned up after when it's done.</p>
<p class="Pp">In this case, you use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;detach()&quot;</span> method. Once a thread is
    detached, it'll run until it's finished; then Perl will clean up after it
    automatically.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use threads;

    my $thr = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;sub1);   # Spawn the thread

    $thr-&gt;detach();   # Now we officially don't care any more

    sleep(15);        # Let thread run for awhile

    sub sub1 {
        $a = 0;
        while (1) {
            $a++;
            print(&quot;\$a is $a\n&quot;);
            sleep(1);
        }
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Once a thread is detached, it may not be joined, and any return
    data that it might have produced (if it was done and waiting for a join) is
    lost.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;detach()&quot;</span> can also be called as
    a class method to allow a thread to detach itself:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use threads;

    my $thr = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;sub1);

    sub sub1 {
        threads-&gt;detach();
        # Do more work
    }
</pre>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Process_and_Thread_Termination"><a class="permalink" href="#Process_and_Thread_Termination">Process
  and Thread Termination</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">With threads one must be careful to make sure they all have a
    chance to run to completion, assuming that is what you want.</p>
<p class="Pp">An action that terminates a process will terminate <i>all</i>
    running threads. <i>die()</i> and <i>exit()</i> have this property, and perl
    does an exit when the main thread exits, perhaps implicitly by falling off
    the end of your code, even if that's not what you want.</p>
<p class="Pp">As an example of this case, this code prints the message
    &quot;Perl exited with active threads: 2 running and unjoined&quot;:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use threads;
    my $thr1 = threads-&gt;new(\&amp;thrsub, &quot;test1&quot;);
    my $thr2 = threads-&gt;new(\&amp;thrsub, &quot;test2&quot;);
    sub thrsub {
       my ($message) = @_;
       sleep 1;
       print &quot;thread $message\n&quot;;
    }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">But when the following lines are added at the end:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $thr1-&gt;join();
    $thr2-&gt;join();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">it prints two lines of output, a perhaps more useful outcome.</p>

</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Threads_And_Data"><a class="permalink" href="#Threads_And_Data">Threads
  And Data</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Now that we've covered the basics of threads, it's time for our
    next topic: Data. Threading introduces a couple of complications to data
    access that non-threaded programs never need to worry about.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Shared_And_Unshared_Data"><a class="permalink" href="#Shared_And_Unshared_Data">Shared
  And Unshared Data</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The biggest difference between Perl <i>ithreads</i> and the old
    5.005 style threading, or for that matter, to most other threading systems
    out there, is that by default, no data is shared. When a new Perl thread is
    created, all the data associated with the current thread is copied to the
    new thread, and is subsequently private to that new thread! This is similar
    in feel to what happens when a Unix process forks, except that in this case,
    the data is just copied to a different part of memory within the same
    process rather than a real fork taking place.</p>
<p class="Pp">To make use of threading, however, one usually wants the threads
    to share at least some data between themselves. This is done with the
    threads::shared module and the <span class="Li">&quot;:shared&quot;</span>
    attribute:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use threads;
    use threads::shared;

    my $foo :shared = 1;
    my $bar = 1;
    threads-&gt;create(sub { $foo++; $bar++; })-&gt;join();

    print(&quot;$foo\n&quot;);  # Prints 2 since $foo is shared
    print(&quot;$bar\n&quot;);  # Prints 1 since $bar is not shared
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In the case of a shared array, all the array's elements are
    shared, and for a shared hash, all the keys and values are shared. This
    places restrictions on what may be assigned to shared array and hash
    elements: only simple values or references to shared variables are allowed -
    this is so that a private variable can't accidentally become shared. A bad
    assignment will cause the thread to die. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use threads;
    use threads::shared;

    my $var          = 1;
    my $svar :shared = 2;
    my %hash :shared;

    ... create some threads ...

    $hash{a} = 1;       # All threads see exists($hash{a}) and $hash{a} == 1
    $hash{a} = $var;    # okay - copy-by-value: same effect as previous
    $hash{a} = $svar;   # okay - copy-by-value: same effect as previous
    $hash{a} = \$svar;  # okay - a reference to a shared variable
    $hash{a} = \$var;   # This will die
    delete($hash{a});   # okay - all threads will see !exists($hash{a})
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that a shared variable guarantees that if two or more threads
    try to modify it at the same time, the internal state of the variable will
    not become corrupted. However, there are no guarantees beyond this, as
    explained in the next section.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Thread_Pitfalls:_Races"><a class="permalink" href="#Thread_Pitfalls:_Races">Thread
  Pitfalls: Races</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">While threads bring a new set of useful tools, they also bring a
    number of pitfalls. One pitfall is the race condition:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use threads;
    use threads::shared;

    my $a :shared = 1;
    my $thr1 = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;sub1);
    my $thr2 = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;sub2);

    $thr1-&gt;join();
    $thr2-&gt;join();
    print(&quot;$a\n&quot;);

    sub sub1 { my $foo = $a; $a = $foo + 1; }
    sub sub2 { my $bar = $a; $a = $bar + 1; }
</pre>
<p class="Pp">What do you think <span class="Li">$a</span> will be? The answer,
    unfortunately, is <i>it</i> <i>depends</i>. Both
    <span class="Li">&quot;sub1()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;sub2()&quot;</span> access the global variable
    <span class="Li">$a</span>, once to read and once to write. Depending on
    factors ranging from your thread implementation's scheduling algorithm to
    the phase of the moon, <span class="Li">$a</span> can be 2 or 3.</p>
<p class="Pp">Race conditions are caused by unsynchronized access to shared
    data. Without explicit synchronization, there's no way to be sure that
    nothing has happened to the shared data between the time you access it and
    the time you update it. Even this simple code fragment has the possibility
    of error:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use threads;
    my $a :shared = 2;
    my $b :shared;
    my $c :shared;
    my $thr1 = threads-&gt;create(sub { $b = $a; $a = $b + 1; });
    my $thr2 = threads-&gt;create(sub { $c = $a; $a = $c + 1; });
    $thr1-&gt;join();
    $thr2-&gt;join();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Two threads both access <span class="Li">$a</span>. Each thread
    can potentially be interrupted at any point, or be executed in any order. At
    the end, <span class="Li">$a</span> could be 3 or 4, and both
    <span class="Li">$b</span> and <span class="Li">$c</span> could be 2 or
  3.</p>
<p class="Pp">Even <span class="Li">&quot;$a += 5&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;$a++&quot;</span> are not guaranteed to be
  atomic.</p>
<p class="Pp">Whenever your program accesses data or resources that can be
    accessed by other threads, you must take steps to coordinate access or risk
    data inconsistency and race conditions. Note that Perl will protect its
    internals from your race conditions, but it won't protect you from you.</p>

  and control</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Perl provides a number of mechanisms to coordinate the
    interactions between themselves and their data, to avoid race conditions and
    the like. Some of these are designed to resemble the common techniques used
    in thread libraries such as <span class="Li">&quot;pthreads&quot;</span>;
    others are Perl-specific. Often, the standard techniques are clumsy and
    difficult to get right (such as condition waits). Where possible, it is
    usually easier to use Perlish techniques such as queues, which remove some
    of the hard work involved.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Controlling_access:_"><a class="permalink" href="#Controlling_access:_">Controlling
  access: <i>lock()</i></a></h2>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;lock()&quot;</span> function takes a
    shared variable and puts a lock on it. No other thread may lock the variable
    until the variable is unlocked by the thread holding the lock. Unlocking
    happens automatically when the locking thread exits the block that contains
    the call to the <span class="Li">&quot;lock()&quot;</span> function. Using
    <span class="Li">&quot;lock()&quot;</span> is straightforward: This example
    has several threads doing some calculations in parallel, and occasionally
    updating a running total:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use threads;
    use threads::shared;

    my $total :shared = 0;

    sub calc {
        while (1) {
            my $result;
            # (... do some calculations and set $result ...)
            {
                lock($total);  # Block until we obtain the lock
                $total += $result;
            } # Lock implicitly released at end of scope
            last if $result == 0;
        }
    }

    my $thr1 = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;calc);
    my $thr2 = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;calc);
    my $thr3 = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;calc);
    $thr1-&gt;join();
    $thr2-&gt;join();
    $thr3-&gt;join();
    print(&quot;total=$total\n&quot;);
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;lock()&quot;</span> blocks the thread until
    the variable being locked is available. When
    <span class="Li">&quot;lock()&quot;</span> returns, your thread can be sure
    that no other thread can lock that variable until the block containing the
    lock exits.</p>
<p class="Pp">It's important to note that locks don't prevent access to the
    variable in question, only lock attempts. This is in keeping with Perl's
    longstanding tradition of courteous programming, and the advisory file
    locking that <span class="Li">&quot;flock()&quot;</span> gives you.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may lock arrays and hashes as well as scalars. Locking an
    array, though, will not block subsequent locks on array elements, just lock
    attempts on the array itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">Locks are recursive, which means it's okay for a thread to lock a
    variable more than once. The lock will last until the outermost
    <span class="Li">&quot;lock()&quot;</span> on the variable goes out of
    scope. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    my $x :shared;
    doit();

    sub doit {
        {
            {
                lock($x); # Wait for lock
                lock($x); # NOOP - we already have the lock
                {
                    lock($x); # NOOP
                    {
                        lock($x); # NOOP
                        lockit_some_more();
                    }
                }
            } # *** Implicit unlock here ***
        }
    }

    sub lockit_some_more {
        lock($x); # NOOP
    } # Nothing happens here
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Note that there is no <span class="Li">&quot;unlock()&quot;</span>
    function - the only way to unlock a variable is to allow it to go out of
    scope.</p>
<p class="Pp">A lock can either be used to guard the data contained within the
    variable being locked, or it can be used to guard something else, like a
    section of code. In this latter case, the variable in question does not hold
    any useful data, and exists only for the purpose of being locked. In this
    respect, the variable behaves like the mutexes and basic semaphores of
    traditional thread libraries.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="A_Thread_Pitfall:_Deadlocks"><a class="permalink" href="#A_Thread_Pitfall:_Deadlocks">A
  Thread Pitfall: Deadlocks</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Locks are a handy tool to synchronize access to data, and using
    them properly is the key to safe shared data. Unfortunately, locks aren't
    without their dangers, especially when multiple locks are involved. Consider
    the following code:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use threads;

    my $a :shared = 4;
    my $b :shared = 'foo';
    my $thr1 = threads-&gt;create(sub {
        lock($a);
        sleep(20);
        lock($b);
    });
    my $thr2 = threads-&gt;create(sub {
        lock($b);
        sleep(20);
        lock($a);
    });
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This program will probably hang until you kill it. The only way it
    won't hang is if one of the two threads acquires both locks first. A
    guaranteed-to-hang version is more complicated, but the principle is the
    same.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first thread will grab a lock on <span class="Li">$a</span>,
    then, after a pause during which the second thread has probably had time to
    do some work, try to grab a lock on <span class="Li">$b</span>. Meanwhile,
    the second thread grabs a lock on <span class="Li">$b</span>, then later
    tries to grab a lock on <span class="Li">$a</span>. The second lock attempt
    for both threads will block, each waiting for the other to release its
  lock.</p>
<p class="Pp">This condition is called a deadlock, and it occurs whenever two or
    more threads are trying to get locks on resources that the others own. Each
    thread will block, waiting for the other to release a lock on a resource.
    That never happens, though, since the thread with the resource is itself
    waiting for a lock to be released.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are a number of ways to handle this sort of problem. The
    best way is to always have all threads acquire locks in the exact same
    order. If, for example, you lock variables <span class="Li">$a</span>,
    <span class="Li">$b</span>, and <span class="Li">$c</span>, always lock
    <span class="Li">$a</span> before <span class="Li">$b</span>, and
    <span class="Li">$b</span> before <span class="Li">$c</span>. It's also best
    to hold on to locks for as short a period of time to minimize the risks of
    deadlock.</p>
<p class="Pp">The other synchronization primitives described below can suffer
    from similar problems.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Queues:_Passing_Data_Around"><a class="permalink" href="#Queues:_Passing_Data_Around">Queues:
  Passing Data Around</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">A queue is a special thread-safe object that lets you put data in
    one end and take it out the other without having to worry about
    synchronization issues. They're pretty straightforward, and look like
  this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use threads;
    use Thread::Queue;

    my $DataQueue = Thread::Queue-&gt;new();
    my $thr = threads-&gt;create(sub {
        while (my $DataElement = $DataQueue-&gt;dequeue()) {
            print(&quot;Popped $DataElement off the queue\n&quot;);
        }
    });

    $DataQueue-&gt;enqueue(12);
    $DataQueue-&gt;enqueue(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;);
    sleep(10);
    $DataQueue-&gt;enqueue(undef);
    $thr-&gt;join();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">You create the queue with
    <span class="Li">&quot;Thread::Queue-&gt;new()&quot;</span>. Then you can
    add lists of scalars onto the end with
    <span class="Li">&quot;enqueue()&quot;</span>, and pop scalars off the front
    of it with <span class="Li">&quot;dequeue()&quot;</span>. A queue has no
    fixed size, and can grow as needed to hold everything pushed on to it.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a queue is empty, <span class="Li">&quot;dequeue()&quot;</span>
    blocks until another thread enqueues something. This makes queues ideal for
    event loops and other communications between threads.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Semaphores:_Synchronizing_Data_Access"><a class="permalink" href="#Semaphores:_Synchronizing_Data_Access">Semaphores:
  Synchronizing Data Access</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Semaphores are a kind of generic locking mechanism. In their most
    basic form, they behave very much like lockable scalars, except that they
    can't hold data, and that they must be explicitly unlocked. In their
    advanced form, they act like a kind of counter, and can allow multiple
    threads to have the <i>lock</i> at any one time.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Basic_semaphores"><a class="permalink" href="#Basic_semaphores">Basic
  semaphores</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Semaphores have two methods,
    <span class="Li">&quot;down()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;up()&quot;</span>:
    <span class="Li">&quot;down()&quot;</span> decrements the resource count,
    while <span class="Li">&quot;up()&quot;</span> increments it. Calls to
    <span class="Li">&quot;down()&quot;</span> will block if the semaphore's
    current count would decrement below zero. This program gives a quick
    demonstration:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use threads;
    use Thread::Semaphore;

    my $semaphore = Thread::Semaphore-&gt;new();
    my $GlobalVariable :shared = 0;

    $thr1 = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;sample_sub, 1);
    $thr2 = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;sample_sub, 2);
    $thr3 = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;sample_sub, 3);

    sub sample_sub {
        my $SubNumber = shift(@_);
        my $TryCount = 10;
        my $LocalCopy;
        sleep(1);
        while ($TryCount--) {
            $semaphore-&gt;down();
            $LocalCopy = $GlobalVariable;
            print(&quot;$TryCount tries left for sub $SubNumber (\$GlobalVariable is $GlobalVariable)\n&quot;);
            sleep(2);
            $LocalCopy++;
            $GlobalVariable = $LocalCopy;
            $semaphore-&gt;up();
        }
    }

    $thr1-&gt;join();
    $thr2-&gt;join();
    $thr3-&gt;join();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The three invocations of the subroutine all operate in sync. The
    semaphore, though, makes sure that only one thread is accessing the global
    variable at once.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Advanced_Semaphores"><a class="permalink" href="#Advanced_Semaphores">Advanced
  Semaphores</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">By default, semaphores behave like locks, letting only one thread
    <span class="Li">&quot;down()&quot;</span> them at a time. However, there
    are other uses for semaphores.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each semaphore has a counter attached to it. By default,
    semaphores are created with the counter set to one,
    <span class="Li">&quot;down()&quot;</span> decrements the counter by one,
    and <span class="Li">&quot;up()&quot;</span> increments by one. However, we
    can override any or all of these defaults simply by passing in different
    values:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use threads;
    use Thread::Semaphore;

    my $semaphore = Thread::Semaphore-&gt;new(5);
                    # Creates a semaphore with the counter set to five

    my $thr1 = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;sub1);
    my $thr2 = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;sub1);

    sub sub1 {
        $semaphore-&gt;down(5); # Decrements the counter by five
        # Do stuff here
        $semaphore-&gt;up(5); # Increment the counter by five
    }

    $thr1-&gt;detach();
    $thr2-&gt;detach();
</pre>
<p class="Pp">If <span class="Li">&quot;down()&quot;</span> attempts to
    decrement the counter below zero, it blocks until the counter is large
    enough. Note that while a semaphore can be created with a starting count of
    zero, any <span class="Li">&quot;up()&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;down()&quot;</span> always changes the counter by at
    least one, and so <span class="Li">&quot;$semaphore-&gt;down(0)&quot;</span>
    is the same as
  <span class="Li">&quot;$semaphore-&gt;down(1)&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The question, of course, is why would you do something like this?
    Why create a semaphore with a starting count that's not one, or why
    decrement or increment it by more than one? The answer is resource
    availability. Many resources that you want to manage access for can be
    safely used by more than one thread at once.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, let's take a GUI driven program. It has a semaphore
    that it uses to synchronize access to the display, so only one thread is
    ever drawing at once. Handy, but of course you don't want any thread to
    start drawing until things are properly set up. In this case, you can create
    a semaphore with a counter set to zero, and up it when things are ready for
    drawing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Semaphores with counters greater than one are also useful for
    establishing quotas. Say, for example, that you have a number of threads
    that can do I/O at once. You don't want all the threads reading or writing
    at once though, since that can potentially swamp your I/O channels, or
    deplete your process's quota of filehandles. You can use a semaphore
    initialized to the number of concurrent I/O requests (or open files) that
    you want at any one time, and have your threads quietly block and unblock
    themselves.</p>
<p class="Pp">Larger increments or decrements are handy in those cases where a
    thread needs to check out or return a number of resources at once.</p>

<p class="Pp">The functions <span class="Li">&quot;cond_wait()&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;cond_signal()&quot;</span> can be used in conjunction
    with locks to notify co-operating threads that a resource has become
    available. They are very similar in use to the functions found in
    <span class="Li">&quot;pthreads&quot;</span>. However for most purposes,
    queues are simpler to use and more intuitive. See threads::shared for more
    details.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Giving_up_control"><a class="permalink" href="#Giving_up_control">Giving

<p class="Pp">There are times when you may find it useful to have a thread
    explicitly give up the CPU to another thread. You may be doing something
    processor-intensive and want to make sure that the user-interface thread
    gets called frequently. Regardless, there are times that you might want a
    thread to give up the processor.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl's threading package provides the
    <span class="Li">&quot;yield()&quot;</span> function that does this.
    <span class="Li">&quot;yield()&quot;</span> is pretty straightforward, and
    works like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use threads;

    sub loop {
        my $thread = shift;
        my $foo = 50;
        while($foo--) { print(&quot;In thread $thread\n&quot;); }
        threads-&gt;yield();
        $foo = 50;
        while($foo--) { print(&quot;In thread $thread\n&quot;); }
    }

    my $thr1 = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;loop, 'first');
    my $thr2 = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;loop, 'second');
    my $thr3 = threads-&gt;create(\&amp;loop, 'third');
</pre>
<p class="Pp">It is important to remember that
    <span class="Li">&quot;yield()&quot;</span> is only a hint to give up the
    CPU, it depends on your hardware, OS and threading libraries what actually
    happens. <b>On many operating systems, </b><b><i>yield()</i></b><b> is a
    no-op.</b> Therefore it is important to note that one should not build the
    scheduling of the threads around <span class="Li">&quot;yield()&quot;</span>
    calls. It might work on your platform but it won't work on another
  platform.</p>

<p class="Pp">This program uses the pipeline model to generate prime numbers.
    Each thread in the pipeline has an input queue that feeds numbers to be
    checked, a prime number that it's responsible for, and an output queue into
    which it funnels numbers that have failed the check. If the thread has a
    number that's failed its check and there's no child thread, then the thread
    must have found a new prime number. In that case, a new child thread is
    created for that prime and stuck on the end of the pipeline.</p>
<p class="Pp">This probably sounds a bit more confusing than it really is, so
    let's go through this program piece by piece and see what it does. (For
    those of you who might be trying to remember exactly what a prime number is,
    it's a number that's only evenly divisible by itself and 1.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The bulk of the work is done by the
    <span class="Li">&quot;check_num()&quot;</span> subroutine, which takes a
    reference to its input queue and a prime number that it's responsible for.
    After pulling in the input queue and the prime that the subroutine is
    checking (line 11), we create a new queue (line 13) and reserve a scalar for
    the thread that we're likely to create later (line 12).</p>
<p class="Pp">The while loop from line 14 to line 26 grabs a scalar off the
    input queue and checks against the prime this thread is responsible for.
    Line 15 checks to see if there's a remainder when we divide the number to be
    checked by our prime. If there is one, the number must not be evenly
    divisible by our prime, so we need to either pass it on to the next thread
    if we've created one (line 17) or create a new thread if we haven't.</p>
<p class="Pp">The new thread creation is line 20. We pass on to it a reference
    to the queue we've created, and the prime number we've found. In lines 21
    through 24, we check to make sure that our new thread got created, and if
    not, we stop checking any remaining numbers in the queue.</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, once the loop terminates (because we got a 0 or
    <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> in the queue, which serves as a
    note to terminate), we pass on the notice to our child, and wait for it to
    exit if we've created a child (lines 27 and 30).</p>
<p class="Pp">Meanwhile, back in the main thread, we first create a queue (line
    33) and queue up all the numbers from 3 to 1000 for checking, plus a
    termination notice. Then all we have to do to get the ball rolling is pass
    the queue and the first prime to the
    <span class="Li">&quot;check_num()&quot;</span> subroutine (line 34).</p>
<p class="Pp">That's how it works. It's pretty simple; as with many Perl
    programs, the explanation is much longer than the program.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Different_implementations_of_threads"><a class="permalink" href="#Different_implementations_of_threads">Different
  implementations of threads</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Some background on thread implementations from the operating
    system viewpoint. There are three basic categories of threads: user-mode
    threads, kernel threads, and multiprocessor kernel threads.</p>
<p class="Pp">User-mode threads are threads that live entirely within a program
    and its libraries. In this model, the OS knows nothing about threads. As far
    as it's concerned, your process is just a process.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is the easiest way to implement threads, and the way most
    OSes start. The big disadvantage is that, since the OS knows nothing about
    threads, if one thread blocks they all do. Typical blocking activities
    include most system calls, most I/O, and things like
    <span class="Li">&quot;sleep()&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Kernel threads are the next step in thread evolution. The OS knows
    about kernel threads, and makes allowances for them. The main difference
    between a kernel thread and a user-mode thread is blocking. With kernel
    threads, things that block a single thread don't block other threads. This
    is not the case with user-mode threads, where the kernel blocks at the
    process level and not the thread level.</p>
<p class="Pp">This is a big step forward, and can give a threaded program quite
    a performance boost over non-threaded programs. Threads that block
    performing I/O, for example, won't block threads that are doing other
    things. Each process still has only one thread running at once, though,
    regardless of how many CPUs a system might have.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since kernel threading can interrupt a thread at any time, they
    will uncover some of the implicit locking assumptions you may make in your
    program. For example, something as simple as <span class="Li">&quot;$a = $a
    + 2&quot;</span> can behave unpredictably with kernel threads if
    <span class="Li">$a</span> is visible to other threads, as another thread
    may have changed <span class="Li">$a</span> between the time it was fetched
    on the right hand side and the time the new value is stored.</p>
<p class="Pp">Multiprocessor kernel threads are the final step in thread
    support. With multiprocessor kernel threads on a machine with multiple CPUs,
    the OS may schedule two or more threads to run simultaneously on different
    CPUs.</p>
<p class="Pp">This can give a serious performance boost to your threaded
    program, since more than one thread will be executing at the same time. As a
    tradeoff, though, any of those nagging synchronization issues that might not
    have shown with basic kernel threads will appear with a vengeance.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to the different levels of OS involvement in threads,
    different OSes (and different thread implementations for a particular OS)
    allocate CPU cycles to threads in different ways.</p>
<p class="Pp">Cooperative multitasking systems have running threads give up
    control if one of two things happen. If a thread calls a yield function, it
    gives up control. It also gives up control if the thread does something that
    would cause it to block, such as perform I/O. In a cooperative multitasking
    implementation, one thread can starve all the others for CPU time if it so
    chooses.</p>
<p class="Pp">Preemptive multitasking systems interrupt threads at regular
    intervals while the system decides which thread should run next. In a
    preemptive multitasking system, one thread usually won't monopolize the
  CPU.</p>
<p class="Pp">On some systems, there can be cooperative and preemptive threads
    running simultaneously. (Threads running with realtime priorities often
    behave cooperatively, for example, while threads running at normal
    priorities behave preemptively.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Most modern operating systems support preemptive multitasking
    nowadays.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Performance_considerations"><a class="permalink" href="#Performance_considerations">Performance
  considerations</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">The main thing to bear in mind when comparing Perl's
    <i>ithreads</i> to other threading models is the fact that for each new
    thread created, a complete copy of all the variables and data of the parent
    thread has to be taken. Thus, thread creation can be quite expensive, both
    in terms of memory usage and time spent in creation. The ideal way to reduce
    these costs is to have a relatively short number of long-lived threads, all
    created fairly early on (before the base thread has accumulated too much
    data). Of course, this may not always be possible, so compromises have to be
    made. However, after a thread has been created, its performance and extra
    memory usage should be little different than ordinary code.</p>
<p class="Pp">Also note that under the current implementation, shared variables
    use a little more memory and are a little slower than ordinary
  variables.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Process-scope_Changes"><a class="permalink" href="#Process-scope_Changes">Process-scope
  Changes</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Note that while threads themselves are separate execution threads
    and Perl data is thread-private unless explicitly shared, the threads can
    affect process-scope state, affecting all the threads.</p>
<p class="Pp">The most common example of this is changing the current working
    directory using <span class="Li">&quot;chdir()&quot;</span>. One thread
    calls <span class="Li">&quot;chdir()&quot;</span>, and the working directory
    of all the threads changes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Even more drastic example of a process-scope change is
    <span class="Li">&quot;chroot()&quot;</span>: the root directory of all the
    threads changes, and no thread can undo it (as opposed to
    <span class="Li">&quot;chdir()&quot;</span>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Further examples of process-scope changes include
    <span class="Li">&quot;umask()&quot;</span> and changing uids and gids.</p>
<p class="Pp">Thinking of mixing <span class="Li">&quot;fork()&quot;</span> and
    threads? Please lie down and wait until the feeling passes. Be aware that
    the semantics of <span class="Li">&quot;fork()&quot;</span> vary between
    platforms. For example, some Unix systems copy all the current threads into
    the child process, while others only copy the thread that called
    <span class="Li">&quot;fork()&quot;</span>. You have been warned!</p>
<p class="Pp">Similarly, mixing signals and threads may be problematic.
    Implementations are platform-dependent, and even the POSIX semantics may not
    be what you expect (and Perl doesn't even give you the full POSIX API). For
    example, there is no way to guarantee that a signal sent to a multi-threaded
    Perl application will get intercepted by any particular thread. (However, a
    recently added feature does provide the capability to send signals between
    threads. See &quot;THREAD SIGNALLING&quot; in threads for more details.)</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="Thread-Safety_of_System_Libraries"><a class="permalink" href="#Thread-Safety_of_System_Libraries">Thread-Safety
  of System Libraries</a></h1>
<p class="Pp">Whether various library calls are thread-safe is outside the
    control of Perl. Calls often suffering from not being thread-safe include:
    <span class="Li">&quot;localtime()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;gmtime()&quot;</span>, functions fetching user, group
    and network information (such as
    <span class="Li">&quot;getgrent()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;gethostent()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;getnetent()&quot;</span> and so on),
    <span class="Li">&quot;readdir()&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;rand()&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;srand()&quot;</span>. In general, calls that depend
    on some global external state.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the system Perl is compiled in has thread-safe variants of such
    calls, they will be used. Beyond that, Perl is at the mercy of the
    thread-safety or -unsafety of the calls. Please consult your C library call
    documentation.</p>
<p class="Pp">On some platforms the thread-safe library interfaces may fail if
    the result buffer is too small (for example the user group databases may be
    rather large, and the reentrant interfaces may have to carry around a full
    snapshot of those databases). Perl will start with a small buffer, but keep
    retrying and growing the result buffer until the result fits. If this
    limitless growing sounds bad for security or memory consumption reasons you
    can recompile Perl with
    <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_REENTRANT_MAXSIZE&quot;</span> defined to the
    maximum number of bytes you will allow.</p>
