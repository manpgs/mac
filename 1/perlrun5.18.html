<p class="Pp">The normal way to run a Perl program is by making it directly
    executable, or else by passing the name of the source file as an argument on
    the command line. (An interactive Perl environment is also possible--see
    perldebug for details on how to do that.) Upon startup, Perl looks for your
    program in one of the following places:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>Specified line by line via <b>-e</b> or <b>-E</b> switches on the command
      line.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>Contained in the file specified by the first filename on the command line.
      (Note that systems supporting the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span>
      notation invoke interpreters this way. See &quot;Location of
    Perl&quot;.)</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>Passed in implicitly via standard input. This works only if there are no
      filename arguments--to pass arguments to a STDIN-read program you must
      explicitly specify a &quot;-&quot; for the program name.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">With methods 2 and 3, Perl starts parsing the input file from the
    beginning, unless you've specified a <b>-x</b> switch, in which case it
    scans for the first line starting with
    <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> and containing the word
    &quot;perl&quot;, and starts there instead. This is useful for running a
    program embedded in a larger message. (In this case you would indicate the
    end of the program using the <span class="Li">&quot;__END__&quot;</span>
    token.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line is always examined
    for switches as the line is being parsed. Thus, if you're on a machine that
    allows only one argument with the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span>
    line, or worse, doesn't even recognize the
    <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line, you still can get consistent
    switch behaviour regardless of how Perl was invoked, even if <b>-x</b> was
    used to find the beginning of the program.</p>
<p class="Pp">Because historically some operating systems silently chopped off
    kernel interpretation of the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line
    after 32 characters, some switches may be passed in on the command line, and
    some may not; you could even get a &quot;-&quot; without its letter, if
    you're not careful. You probably want to make sure that all your switches
    fall either before or after that 32-character boundary. Most switches don't
    actually care if they're processed redundantly, but getting a &quot;-&quot;
    instead of a complete switch could cause Perl to try to execute standard
    input instead of your program. And a partial <b>-I</b> switch could also
    cause odd results.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some switches do care if they are processed twice, for instance
    combinations of <b>-l</b> and <b>-0</b>. Either put all the switches after
    the 32-character boundary (if applicable), or replace the use of
    <b>-0</b><i>digits</i> by <span class="Li">&quot;BEGIN{ $/ =
    &quot;\0digits&quot;; }&quot;</span>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Parsing of the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> switches
    starts wherever &quot;perl&quot; is mentioned in the line. The sequences
    &quot;-*&quot; and &quot;- &quot; are specifically ignored so that you
    could, if you were so inclined, say</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    #!/bin/sh
    #! -*-perl-*-
    eval 'exec perl -x -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
        if 0;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">to let Perl see the <b>-p</b> switch.</p>
<p class="Pp">A similar trick involves the <i>env</i> program, if you have
  it.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/env perl
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The examples above use a relative path to the perl interpreter,
    getting whatever version is first in the user's path. If you want a specific
    version of Perl, say, perl5.14.1, you should place that directly in the
    <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line's path.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line does not
    contain the word &quot;perl&quot; nor the word &quot;indir&quot; the program
    named after the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> is executed instead
    of the Perl interpreter. This is slightly bizarre, but it helps people on
    machines that don't do <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span>, because they
    can tell a program that their SHELL is <i>/usr/bin/perl</i>, and Perl will
    then dispatch the program to the correct interpreter for them.</p>
<p class="Pp">After locating your program, Perl compiles the entire program to
    an internal form. If there are any compilation errors, execution of the
    program is not attempted. (This is unlike the typical shell script, which
    might run part-way through before finding a syntax error.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If the program is syntactically correct, it is executed. If the
    program runs off the end without hitting an <i>exit()</i> or <i>die()</i>
    operator, an implicit <span class="Li">exit(0)</span> is provided to
    indicate successful completion.</p>

  and quoting on non-Unix systems</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">Unix's <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> technique can be
    simulated on other systems:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>Put
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    extproc perl -S -your_switches
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">as the first line in <span class="Li">&quot;*.cmd&quot;</span>
        file (<b>-S</b> due to a bug in cmd.exe's `extproc' handling).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt id="MS-DOS"><a class="permalink" href="#MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a></dt>
  <dd>Create a batch file to run your program, and codify it in
      <span class="Li">&quot;ALTERNATE_SHEBANG&quot;</span> (see the
      <i>dosish.h</i> file in the source distribution for more
    information).</dd>
  <dt id="Win95/NT"><a class="permalink" href="#Win95/NT">Win95/NT</a></dt>
  <dd>The Win95/NT installation, when using the ActiveState installer for Perl,
      will modify the Registry to associate the <i>.pl</i> extension with the
      perl interpreter. If you install Perl by other means (including building
      from the sources), you may have to modify the Registry yourself. Note that
      this means you can no longer tell the difference between an executable
      Perl program and a Perl library file.</dd>
  <dt id="VMS"><a class="permalink" href="#VMS">VMS</a></dt>
  <dd>Put
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
 $ perl -mysw 'f$env(&quot;procedure&quot;)' 'p1' 'p2' 'p3' 'p4' 'p5' 'p6' 'p7' 'p8' !
 $ exit++ + ++$status != 0 and $exit = $status = undef;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">at the top of your program, where <b>-mysw</b> are any command
        line switches you want to pass to Perl. You can now invoke the program
        directly, by saying <span class="Li">&quot;perl program&quot;</span>, or
        as a DCL procedure, by saying <span class="Li">@program</span> (or
        implicitly via <i>DCL$PATH</i> by just using the name of the
      program).</p>
    <p class="Pp">This incantation is a bit much to remember, but Perl will
        display it for you if you say <span class="Li">&quot;perl
        &quot;-V:startperl&quot;&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Command-interpreters on non-Unix systems have rather different
    ideas on quoting than Unix shells. You'll need to learn the special
    characters in your command-interpreter
    (<span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span> are common) and how to protect
    whitespace and these characters to run one-liners (see -e below).</p>
<p class="Pp">On some systems, you may have to change single-quotes to double
    ones, which you must <i>not</i> do on Unix or Plan 9 systems. You might also
    have to change a single % to a %%.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    # Unix
    perl -e 'print &quot;Hello world\n&quot;'

    # MS-DOS, etc.
    perl -e &quot;print \&quot;Hello world\n\&quot;&quot;

    # VMS
    perl -e &quot;print &quot;&quot;Hello world\n&quot;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The problem is that none of this is reliable: it depends on the
    command and it is entirely possible neither works. If <i>4DOS</i> were the
    command shell, this would probably work better:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    perl -e &quot;print &lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;Hello world\n&lt;Ctrl-x&gt;&quot;&quot;
</pre>
<p class="Pp"><b>CMD.EXE</b> in Windows NT slipped a lot of standard Unix
    functionality in when nobody was looking, but just try to find documentation
    for its quoting rules.</p>
<p class="Pp">There is no general solution to all of this. It's just a mess.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Location_of_Perl"><a class="permalink" href="#Location_of_Perl">Location
  of Perl</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">It may seem obvious to say, but Perl is useful only when users can
    easily find it. When possible, it's good for both <i>/usr/bin/perl</i> and
    <i>/usr/local/bin/perl</i> to be symlinks to the actual binary. If that
    can't be done, system administrators are strongly encouraged to put
    (symlinks to) perl and its accompanying utilities into a directory typically
    found along a user's PATH, or in some other obvious and convenient
  place.</p>
<p class="Pp">In this documentation,
    <span class="Li">&quot;#!/usr/bin/perl&quot;</span> on the first line of the
    program will stand in for whatever method works on your system. You are
    advised to use a specific path if you care about a specific version.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/local/bin/perl5.14
</pre>
<p class="Pp">or if you just want to be running at least version, place a
    statement like this at the top of your program:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    use 5.014;

<h2 class="Ss" id="Command_Switches"><a class="permalink" href="#Command_Switches">Command
  Switches</a></h2>
<p class="Pp">As with all standard commands, a single-character switch may be
    clustered with the following switch, if any.</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -spi.orig   # same as -s -p -i.orig
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Switches include:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-0</b>[<i>octal/hexadecimal</i>]</dt>
  <dd>specifies the input record separator (<span class="Li">$/</span>) as an
      octal or hexadecimal number. If there are no digits, the null character is
      the separator. Other switches may precede or follow the digits. For
      example, if you have a version of <i>find</i> which can print filenames
      terminated by the null character, you can say this:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    find . -name '*.orig' -print0 | perl -n0e unlink
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The special value 00 will cause Perl to slurp files in
        paragraph mode. Any value 0400 or above will cause Perl to slurp files
        whole, but by convention the value 0777 is the one normally used for
        this purpose.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can also specify the separator character using hexadecimal
        notation: <b>-0x</b><b><i>HHH...</i></b><b></b>, where the
        <span class="Li">&quot;</span><i>H</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span> are
        valid hexadecimal digits. Unlike the octal form, this one may be used to
        specify any Unicode character, even those beyond 0xFF. So if you
        <i>really</i> want a record separator of 0777, specify it as
        <b>-0x1FF</b>. (This means that you cannot use the <b>-x</b> option with
        a directory name that consists of hexadecimal digits, or else Perl will
        think you have specified a hex number to <b>-0</b>.)</p>

    S     7   I + O + E
    i     8   UTF-8 is the default PerlIO layer for input streams

              them conditional on the locale environment variables
              (the LC_ALL, LC_TYPE, and LANG, in the order of
              decreasing precedence) -- if the variables indicate
              UTF-8, then the selected &quot;IOEioA&quot; are in effect
    a   256   Set ${^UTF8CACHE} to -1, to run the UTF-8 caching
              code in debugging mode.
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For example, <b>-COE</b> and <b>-C6</b> will both turn on
        UTF-8-ness on both STDOUT and STDERR. Repeating letters is just
        redundant, not cumulative nor toggling.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <span class="Li">&quot;io&quot;</span> options mean that
        any subsequent <i>open()</i> (or similar I/O operations) in the current
        file scope will have the <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span>
        PerlIO layer implicitly applied to them, in other words, UTF-8 is
        expected from any input stream, and UTF-8 is produced to any output
        stream. This is just the default, with explicit layers in <i>open()</i>
        and with <i>binmode()</i> one can manipulate streams as usual.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>-C</b> on its own (not followed by any number or option
        list), or the empty string <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span> for the
        <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot;</span> environment variable,
        has the same effect as <b>-CSDL</b>. In other words, the standard I/O
        handles and the default <span class="Li">&quot;open()&quot;</span> layer
        are UTF-8-fied <i>but</i> only if the locale environment variables
        indicate a UTF-8 locale. This behaviour follows the <i>implicit</i> (and
        problematic) UTF-8 behaviour of Perl 5.8.0. (See &quot;UTF-8 no longer
        default under UTF-8 locales&quot; in perl581delta.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can use <b>-C0</b> (or
        <span class="Li">&quot;0&quot;</span> for
        <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_UNICODE&quot;</span>) to explicitly disable
        all the above Unicode features.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The read-only magic variable
        <span class="Li">&quot;${^UNICODE}&quot;</span> reflects the numeric
        value of this setting. This variable is set during Perl startup and is
        thereafter read-only. If you want runtime effects, use the three-arg
        <i>open()</i> (see &quot;open&quot; in perlfunc), the two-arg
        <i>binmode()</i> (see &quot;binmode&quot; in perlfunc), and the
        <span class="Li">&quot;open&quot;</span> pragma (see open).</p>
    <p class="Pp">(In Perls earlier than 5.8.1 the <b>-C</b> switch was a
        Win32-only switch that enabled the use of Unicode-aware &quot;wide
        system call&quot; Win32 APIs. This feature was practically unused,
        however, and the command line switch was therefore
        &quot;recycled&quot;.)</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>Note:</b> Since perl 5.10.1, if the <b>-C</b> option is
        used on the <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line, it must be
        specified on the command line as well, since the standard streams are
        already set up at this point in the execution of the perl interpreter.
        You can also use <i>binmode()</i> to set the encoding of an I/O
      stream.</p>

        BEGIN block). This is a hook that allows the sysadmin to customize how
        Perl behaves. It can for instance be used to add entries to the
        <span class="Li">@INC</span> array to make Perl find modules in
        non-standard locations.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl actually inserts the following code:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    BEGIN {
        do { local $!; -f &quot;$Config{sitelib}/sitecustomize.pl&quot;; }

        (not a <span class="Li">&quot;require&quot;</span>),
        <i>sitecustomize.pl</i> doesn't need to return a true value. The code is
        run in package <span class="Li">&quot;main&quot;</span>, in its own
        lexical scope. However, if the script dies, <span class="Li">$@</span>
        will not be set.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The value of <span class="Li">$Config{sitelib}</span> is also

  <dd>specifies that files processed by the

      in-place. It does this by renaming the input file, opening the output file
      by the original name, and selecting that output file as the default for
      <i>print()</i> statements. The extension, if supplied, is used to modify
      the name of the old file to make a backup copy, following these rules:
    <p class="Pp">If no extension is supplied, and your system supports it, the
        original <i>file</i> is kept open without a name while the output is
        redirected to a new file with the original <i>filename</i>. When perl
        exits, cleanly or not, the original <i>file</i> is unlinked.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the extension doesn't contain a
        <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span>, then it is appended to the end of
        the current filename as a suffix. If the extension does contain one or
        more <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> characters, then each
        <span class="Li">&quot;*&quot;</span> is replaced with the current
        filename. In Perl terms, you could think of this as:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    ($backup = $extension) =~ s/\*/$file_name/g;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This allows you to add a prefix to the backup file, instead of

 $ perl -pi'orig_*' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA  # backup to
                                           # 'orig_fileA'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Or even to place backup copies of the original files into
        another directory (provided the directory already exists):</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
 $ perl -pi'old/*.orig' -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA  # backup to
                                               # 'old/fileA.orig'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">These sets of one-liners are equivalent:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
 $ perl -pi -e 's/bar/baz/' fileA          # overwrite current file

        the selected filehandle. Note that STDOUT is restored as the default
        output filehandle after the loop.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As shown above, Perl creates the backup file whether or not
        any output is actually changed. So this is just a fancy way to copy
        files:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    $ perl -p -i'/some/file/path/*' -e 1 file1 file2 file3...
or
    $ perl -p -i'.orig' -e 1 file1 file2 file3...
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">You can use <span class="Li">&quot;eof&quot;</span> without
        parentheses to locate the end of each input file, in case you want to
        append to each file, or reset line numbering (see example in
        &quot;eof&quot; in perlfunc).</p>
    <p class="Pp">If, for a given file, Perl is unable to create the backup file
        as specified in the extension then it will skip that file and continue
        on with the next one (if it exists).</p>
    <p class="Pp">For a discussion of issues surrounding file permissions and
        <b>-i</b>, see &quot;Why does Perl let me delete read-only files? Why
        does -i clobber protected files? Isn't this a bug in Perl?&quot; in
        perlfaq5.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You cannot use <b>-i</b> to create directories or to strip
        extensions from files.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Perl does not expand <span class="Li">&quot;~&quot;</span> in
        filenames, which is good, since some folks use it for their backup
        files:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    $ perl -pi~ -e 's/foo/bar/' file1 file2 file3...
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that because <b>-i</b> renames or deletes the original
        file before creating a new file of the same name, Unix-style soft and
        hard links will not be preserved.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Finally, the <b>-i</b> switch does not impede execution when
        no files are given on the command line. In this case, no backup is made
        (the original file cannot, of course, be determined) and processing
        proceeds from STDIN to STDOUT as might be expected.</p>

      assigns <span class="Li">&quot;$\&quot;</span> (the output record

      will have that separator added back on. If <i>octnum</i> is omitted, sets
      <span class="Li">&quot;$\&quot;</span> to the current value of
      <span class="Li">$/</span>. For instance, to trim lines to 80 columns:
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    perl -lpe 'substr($_, 80) = &quot;&quot;'
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the assignment <span class="Li">&quot;$\ =
        $/&quot;</span> is done when the switch is processed, so the input
        record separator can be different than the output record separator if
        the <b>-l</b> switch is followed by a <b>-0</b> switch:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
    gnufind / -print0 | perl -ln0e 'print &quot;found $_&quot; if -p'

  <dd>makes Perl use the PATH environment variable to search for the program
      unless the name of the program contains path separators.
    <p class="Pp">On some platforms, this also makes Perl append suffixes to the
        filename while searching for it. For example, on Win32 platforms, the
        &quot;.bat&quot; and &quot;.cmd&quot; suffixes are appended if a lookup
        for the original name fails, and if the name does not already end in one
        of those suffixes. If your Perl was compiled with

        when debugging a script that uses
        <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span>, and is thus normally found by
        the shell's <span class="Li">$PATH</span> search mechanism.</p>

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The system ignores the first line and feeds the program to
        <i>/bin/sh</i>, which proceeds to try to execute the Perl program as a
        shell script. The shell executes the second line as a normal shell
        command, and thus starts up the Perl interpreter. On some systems
        <span class="Li">$0</span> doesn't always contain the full pathname, so
        the <b>-S</b> tells Perl to search for the program if necessary. After
        Perl locates the program, it parses the lines and ignores them because
        the variable <span class="Li">$running_under_some_shell</span> is never
        true. If the program will be interpreted by csh, you will need to
        replace <span class="Li">&quot;${1+&quot;$@&quot;}&quot;</span> with
        <span class="Li">$*</span>, even though that doesn't understand embedded
        spaces (and such) in the argument list. To start up <i>sh</i> rather
        than <i>csh</i>, some systems may have to replace the
        <span class="Li">&quot;#!&quot;</span> line with a line containing just
        a colon, which will be politely ignored by Perl. Other systems can't
        control that, and need a totally devious construct that will work under
        any of <i>csh</i>, <i>sh</i>, or Perl, such as the following:</p>
    <p class="Pp"></p>
    <pre>
        eval '(exit $?0)' &amp;&amp; eval 'exec perl -wS $0 ${1+&quot;$@&quot;}'
        &amp; eval 'exec /usr/bin/perl -wS $0 $argv:q'
                if $running_under_some_shell;
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If the filename supplied contains directory separators (and so
        is an absolute or relative pathname), and if that file is not found,
        platforms that append file extensions will do so and try to look for the
        file with those extensions added, one by one.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On DOS-like platforms, if the program does not contain
        directory separators, it will first be searched for in the current
        directory before being searched for on the PATH. On Unix platforms, the

  <dd>This switch causes Perl to dump core after compiling your program. You can
      then in theory take this core dump and turn it into an executable file by
      using the <i>undump</i> program (not supplied). This speeds startup at the
      expense of some disk space (which you can minimize by stripping the
      executable). (Still, a &quot;hello world&quot; executable comes out to
      about 200K on my machine.) If you want to execute a portion of your

    <p class="Pp">All references to line numbers by the program (warnings,

    <p class="Pp">If a directory name is specified, Perl will switch to that

  <dd>A space (or colon) separated list of PerlIO layers. If perl is built to

    <p class="Pp">It is conventional to start layer names with a colon (for

        similarity to variable &quot;attributes&quot;. But the code that parses

    <p class="Pp">An unset or empty PERLIO is equivalent to the default set of

    <p class="Pp">The list becomes the default for <i>all</i> Perl's IO.
        Consequently only built-in layers can appear in this list, as external

  <dd>A layer that implements &quot;reading&quot; of files by using
      <i>mmap</i>(2) to make an entire file appear in the process's address

  <dt>:perlio</dt>
  <dd>This is a re-implementation of stdio-like buffering written as a PerlIO

  <dd>An experimental pseudolayer that removes the topmost layer. Use with the

  <dt>:raw</dt>

      each byte as-is without translation. In particular, both CRLF translation
      and intuiting <span class="Li">&quot;:utf8&quot;</span> from the locale

<p class="Pp">On Win32 the default in this release (5.14) is &quot;unix

<p class="Pp">This release (5.14) uses <span class="Li">&quot;unix&quot;</span>

    <p class="Pp">If the option is provided, and

<p class="Pp">Perl also has environment variables that control how Perl handles
    data specific to particular natural languages; see perllocale.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl and its various modules and components, including its test
    frameworks, may sometimes make use of certain other environment variables.
    Some of these are specific to a particular platform. Please consult the
    appropriate module documentation and any documentation for your platform
    (like perlsolaris, perllinux, perlmacosx, perlwin32, etc) for variables
    peculiar to those specific situations.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl makes all environment variables available to the program
    being executed, and passes these along to any child processes it starts.
    However, programs running setuid would do well to execute the following
    lines before doing anything else, just to keep people honest:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    $ENV{PATH}  = &quot;/bin:/usr/bin&quot;;    # or whatever you need

    delete @ENV{qw(IFS CDPATH ENV BASH_ENV)};
